Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.
Well, there's someone I think might be --
Tons
No...
Queen Harry?
I think you're a freak.  I think you do this to torture me.  And I think you suck.
Otherwise known as an orgy?
Just for a minute
Why?
No, but
He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that is.
Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
Just sent 'em through.
So they tell me...
C'mon.  I'm supposed to give you the tour.
How many people go here?
You could consecrate with her, my friend.
You need money to take a girl out
You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
He always look so
But imagine the things he'd say during sex.
You could always go with me.  I'm sure William has some friends.
No fear.
Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway
My mission in life.
Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.
"I'm getting trashed, man." Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?
I say, do what you wanna do.
I'm fine. I'm
See that?  Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
Who?
Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.  And piss you off.
Good call.
Acting the way we do.
You never disappointed me.
You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
Go to the prom with me
It wasn't like that.
You decided.
Parts of it.
Oh, Christ.  Don't tell me you've changed your mind.  I already sent 'em a check.
The point is Kat -- people perceive you as somewhat ...
Right.
Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm just in this for the cash.
I'm at a loss, then.  What should we talk about? Your year of absence?
You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?
Your life, and that of others!
Did He not choose a carpenter's son to reveal Himself to the world?
Blind faith is what I consider heresy!
I can arrange for the Queen to take Fernando and Diego into her service.
May I ask by whom?
Appointment to what?
Thousands.
You did the same to your God!
Father, I am doing what I think is the best for him.  And he has the teacher I would have chosen for myself.
Passion is something one cannot control!
Damn all of you!  You all set up theories based on what?  You never leave the safety of your studies! Go out!  Find out what the world is about and then tell me something I can listen to!
I knew you would.
Savagery is what monkeys understand.
We can't be.
We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
He must be replaced.
He has the camera!  He took the movie!
I'm invoking rights - this man is represented by counsel.  I'm coming with him.
You bring the cigarettes?
What about my movie rights?  Book rights?
Your father put cigarettes out on you?
Can I see your back?
No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
Right.
In the kitchen.
You're a cop - you'll never believe me.
'Cause we got more important things to do, like finding out who did it.
But Chief?  Over this??
Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.
Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street.  You got that?
Vodka tonic.
Tomorrow.  At lunch.
I know.  Relax.  Take it easy.  Don't worry, we'll get those fuckers.
He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly!
Watch the news?
You got any better ideas?
Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?
Yeah.
My point exactly.
Women like that have a way of turning professionals into amateurs.
Can we go up to the crime scene?
Yeah.  Now's not a good time.
Hey.
I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you!
Okay.  That is great.  But I can't go now, we're in the middle of something here.
Thank you.
Let her go!  Let her go!!
If he doesn't lower his gun I'll fucking kill her.
Baby, I'm anybody you want me to be. I'm a little schoolgirl, I'm mommy, I'm a Czech girl.
Can you show me?  Sir, no cameras in the FIS area!
I want to document my trip to America.
Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?
For five years I paid for your stupidness - you'll carry my bag for the rest of my life if I say so.  Unless you refuse, Oleg.
Don't want to film this?
I did.
Put the camera down, Oleg.
Oleg, don't be paranoid.  You got a hundred-fifty thousand dollars, didn't you?  I gave you half of what they gave me.  Look - here we are!
Milos.  Get my money!
Yes, the money is good.
If I didn't put it on somebody else would!  I was his friend!
He's my collar!
Yeah, I'm religious.  I'm not an Atheist like you!  Now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not?
Yeah?
Your doctor?
No. I never did, either.
Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
I'm fine, Daddy. When are you coming home?
Okay, sweetheart. Well, I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called.
Yes, Daddy.
Thank you.
Well, how's it going back there?
Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.
Please, it really doesn't matter.
You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?
We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?
Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?
Well, thank you very much, and please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your trip more comfortable.
Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false?
That's true.
Hal, I'm going out now to replace the A.O. unit.
Great, just great.
Maybe I better ask around, see what your pals think.
Try obeyin' the law once in awhile, and I won't have to hassle you...
Excuse me, baby, but if i don't get some action tonight, I'm gonna bust.  You interested?
I ain't gonna beg for my life. It ain't cool.
Sure, anything you want.
You just don't get it, do your Reggie?  There isn't any deal. I own your ass.
I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.
You have a good time?
This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece...
I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes.
My kind of place. I always liked country boys.
Who gives a Goddamn what you think? You're just a crook that's got a weekendpass ... You're not even a name anymore. Just a spear- chucker with a Goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues...
How much?
He's after your money.
Not likely, convict.
Jesus Christ.  That's a disgrace The guy pulls a gun on a cop and he's out in 24 hours.  I tell you some of the courts these days are just a fucking revolving door.
I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.
No class...
Yeah, most cops are pretty dumb... But since you're the one that landed in jail what's that make you?
What about Ganz?
So you took the rest of the night off...
When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.
Back to jail in my own car.  Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don't seem right.
Are you gonna tell me about police procedure?  Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap.
I guess when two cops die on account of your fuck up you want to keep it as quiet as possible...
Uhh ... Wong, Henry Wong.  He was in on the same job.
I'm heading out. How about you?
Okay.  See you in the morning... you know, you ought to get some rest...
I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.
Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
What do you want to know?  What difference does it make?  I'm the guy in your bed the last three months.  I make you feel good. You make me feel good.  What the hell else do you want from a guy?
Jack, are you okay?
Here it comes again ... the sacred job...
This is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave.
I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...
Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.
Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
Shrink major, not a shrink.
We'll follow you.  Take it slow,okay?
Sure, right.
We have to save the world.
Yes..thank God..
I can't wear these clothes! This calls for dignity! I have to dress the part!
The Fifth Element... The Supreme Being... Your wife...
I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are!
I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!
Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.
I had the worst goddamn nightmare.
...You got brothers and sisters? What about your dad? Tell me about your dad! What was he like? Physically? Big, I suppose?
Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do nothing!
You're to leave immediately for Fhloston Paradise. Retrieve four Stones from the Diva Plavalaguna. And bring them back with the utmost discretion as possible. Any questions'?
I've had enough good news for today
All 900.
Apipoussan!
Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?
Uh..
I have to address the Supreme Council in 10 minutes. Just the facts, General.
There are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis as of yet, all the calibers are overshot..we're hoping a thermo nucleatic imaging..
Options.
Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?
Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.
Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.
Your clothing reeks of it.
We've been all through that.  I've been on my best behavior.
I was in hell.  If I called you... if I heard your voice... it would have been so easy for me to quit. I couldn't do that.
What?
And they are?
We can do that.
Well, well, I'll have to put my thinking-cap on about all this. You'll leave the money as a deposit?  Very good.
What's the problem?
You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture?
They should be here any minute.
Put the gun down, take the handcuffs.  Handcuff yourself to the bed.
Leave him alone.
For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.
This doctor and wife, they're nice people, but they don't want to get too involved.  They're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either. You and I both know sometimes, not often, but sometimes there's real reasons why a kid'll run. Molestation, whatever.  Besides that, the girl's probably eighteen, so she's legal.
They're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay, even if that's all they hear.
Don't bore me with that bullshit.
How'd you find me here?
What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?
Do it!  Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore.  You think it's so easy?
The only thing wrong is the cheap, softcore crap you're peddling, Eddie.  Where do you get this stuff?
So, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy.  And if you refused, it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film.  That's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege.
Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.
Max.
I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about?
You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb.  So what? Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for President?  What about you, pops?
Mostly.  That's where he started his empire building.  He was a good man.  Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated.  He wanted to be legendary.
You hired someone to open it.  I'll bet the lawyer loved that.
My husband never dealt with money personally, certainly not cash.
How are you?  Having any luck?
She didn't seem herself.  For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it.  One night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone.  She took some clothes.
What?
It's not really my place, but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. See, I know a little about missing persons.  When kids run, they almost always leave a note.  It's guilt. They want to say goodbye.
If the police focused their search in her room, her belongings, well that'd be only natural, but they may have been looking in the wrong place.
Yes.
Mrs. Mathews?  It's Thomas.  Do you remember, I was there a few weeks ago... asking about your daughter...
I'll do what I can.
Okay.  Fine.
Yeah, I know the spiel.  If you could bag it, I'll be on my way, thank you.
Never say can't.  Just do what I do.
Yeah, I'm not so sure.
I know.
Look, you know why, you just don't believe me.
Now it gets weird.  She says he comes back in dreams.  If he kills you there, you're dead for real.
Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?
Huh?
I watched from behind the stands.  Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know.  "The drunk showed up", that kind of thing...
Since my little girl became a mom...
Yeah...So that's him.  And you're not crazy.
So did Dan.
That's okay.  He's got the rest of his life to catch up on his sleep.
That's why it's my fault Dan's dead.
Makes you look like a nun--
It was moderate.  He'll be all right.  But it was out of the question, his coming along.
Not in two days.  Look:  Do you think I <u>wanted</u> to come?  If it didn't mean so much to Dad - proving his depth-explorer - it's the last thing I'd want!
You mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting for?
- any more than being the son of Captain Neilsen does!
So all of a sudden his only son drops out of school, be- gins making noises like a pacifist.  A real egghead, do-gooder, and crackpot!  'Ban the atom tests!  Junk the nuclear subs!  Spend the mili- tary budgetfor peace!'
Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?
'Us?'
Oh it does???
Speed...about twenty-two knots. Course...due north!
The frogmen?
What????
Under <u>water</u>?
I did go.  Just back.  Reef, these are a couple of our passengers - Sir Ian Hunt, and Dr. Clifford Kent.  My exec, Commander Richard Holloway.
It'll be all right.  We're old friends!
Take a look.
Point of view is everything. To us, <u>your</u> form of life is ugly as we appear to you.
Obviously.
Thank you.
But <u>answers</u> are what we need - not more questions!
Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned tooth, I got a few things bugging me, like everybody else. But I'm okay.
Who?
About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?
All the figures show is that Gordon LaRiviere is going to be a very rich man using his position as Selectman. In a year or two, you won't recognize this town.
You might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the --
Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to Mel.
If you get it?
You might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. Can't guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it.
And you'll get your extra hundred bucks.
Yeah.
Sun's gettin high.
Some job. Here, have a hit. Don't be such a hardass. I know you got problems, but everybody's got problems. 
Right!
I gotta make a report to Fish and Game. I was just wondering, that's all. What'd he do, to shoot himself, I mean?
Open the door. We're late.
Yeah. It's stupid.
Did you do that when you were a kid?
Was it funny?
What are you talking about?
What then?
No.
Yes.
Pop?
Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you.
What do you want, then?
You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?
Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --
Okay.
Oh.
Where's the plow?
Don't go playing policeman.
You don't want the extra police pay?
Nothing, Wade, I've been thinking. You don't get enough appreciation around here and it's time we changed things a little.
I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.
Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal.
Want to buy?
Maybe.
Let the past be.  I'm sorry about your mother. I liked her. You never know how much women like that suffer. It's like they live their lives with the sound turned off -- and then they're gone.
Okay. She's fine.
You okay?
Yeah. I mean that.
You knew me as a kid.
After making love. I like it. It's nice to see that in a grown-up person.
Oh, Wade.
How?
I heard you talking. You got fired this morning, didn't you?
You're not using it today?
It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom.
Moving violation! I just got out of bed and you're telling me you're giving me a goddamn speeding ticket? Now? Are you nuts? Is that it, Whitehouse? You're nuts?
He's asleep. We were up very late.
Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.
Well, yeah, I suppose. Sure. I just had a little business to settle with Mr. Gordon. I'm the local police officer.
Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering. Whatever somebody does to improve things around here, you gotta find fault with it.
This town sucks.
Sleeping.
From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?
Yeah.
You and me.
No, not tonight. I'm in bed too. I'm calling because I need you to listen. You're supposed to be a smart guy. You're a professor. I got this theory. Jack says he didn't see Twombley shot but he did.
Well, it was an accident.
Huh?
Who?
Yeah. I forgot.
Want to know what I think happened?
Which is?
It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne.
Well, I never heard that one.
I remember clearly cause when I heard I became real careful around Pop. I was a careful child and I became a careful adult, but at least I wasn't afflicted by that man's violence.
Wade, are you alright?
Yeah, no duh.
I'm sorry I was so mean to you earlier.
Jim... for godsake!
You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights.
We still got three MiGs running around and six more on the way.
Sluggish... I think it's jammed too.
We don't know that.
I prefered the terrorists.
That's game, set, and match. There's nothing to do, except call the Chief Justice.
We've got four hours before they make it into Turkienistan airspace.
Like any good poker player, they're checking over their hand seeing which cards to play and which to discard.
Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying.
Yes, Mr. President.
Why?
My loyalty was never to my country.
why did they do that?
Yes
I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.
Call up Petrov and order Stravanavitch' S release.
Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two hundred knots... otherwise it's suicide.
Can't it wait?
They're still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes.
This is the President.
Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.
Thank you for calling the white House...
DO YOU SEE TEEM?
Yes it did.  Mr. Dunn, can I ask you a personal question?
That's not important now, Elaine.  We have to talk.
Let's relax tonight, just the two of us. I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti.
You're as bad as the rest of them, Elaine!  It's all here in the design specifications!  Look!  It's all here!
And when are you going to realize, Ted, that your mental hygiene is the most important thing right now.
If that's the way you want it.
Ted, there's no time to explain.
Ted, please be careful.
I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.
Now!
But, darling, they've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the Jupiter probe.
Simon, why has he become so... so...
I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.
We'll have to check, Jimmy.  It's a pretty long trip to Mercury.
No more kids yelling, 'Your old man's a thieving rapist'?
I'm sure.
Just poached on toast.  Over.
All right, Captain Oveur.  Over.
Do you think it's necessary to explain <u>everything</u>?
Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.
I know you've been subtly spreading the word that I'm having a breakdown.
That damn computer has taken over.  I'm getting out.
Then Elaine was right.
Well, we laughed.  We laughed all the time.
No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men.
You know, here we are having coffee together, and discussing education and business and economy...and we don't even know each other's names...full names I mean.
I won't deceive you, Mister Striker. We're running out of time.
Well...not for another two hours.
Certainly.
He had fish.
I think you ought to know what our chances are. The life of everyone on board depends on just one thing: finding someone back there who not only can fly this plane, but who didn't have fish for dinner.
Then why don't you take the job that Louie Netz offered you at Boeing?
My orders came through. My squadron ships out tomorrow. I'll be leading a very important mission.
I love you.
But it won't be. Not as long as you insist on living in the past!
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
Tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land.
Good-bye, darling.
Here.
I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense.
No. No thank you.
Not unless I got real drunk and nobody told me about it later.
I like my horizons narrow.
I may be an asshole, but at least I'm a real detective, not some outer shit space thing.
You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate thing.
This is becoming a serious breach of security.
With two BRI Sabot slugs in the chest.
Through the chest.  Rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts.
And that fits?
I'll bet.  Would it really put you out if they tossed that on the grill for a minute or two?
Jesus, this is major.  Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why'd you hold out on me?
Your people don't know about this part of out past.  And they can't know -- It would threaten our entire existence here.
Fuck procedure.
You understand that.  But how many others will?
We think he could'a been involved, yeah.  You know him?
Wait.  You know who it looks like? Yeah.  Anderson.  Uh... James Anderson.  He isn't in today.  He took the afternoon off.
Yeah... I seen him around.  High- roller dude named Strader.  Joshua Strader.  Runs a club on the west side.  Encounters.
The human?
Fedorchuk couldn't find his ass with his hands in his back pockets.
Vasquez, take point.  Let's move.
Yes.  That follows.
But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.
That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs.
I heard you were working in the cargo docks.
Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?
Now hold on a second.  I'm not authorizing that action.
What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.
You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it.
You sent them to that ship.  I just checked the colony log... directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine. Signed Burke, Carter J.
Thirty-eight...simulated.
Gorman!  Give it a rest would you.
Shut up.  Just shut up!
He's coming in.  I feel safer already.
Okay, stand by in operations.  Let's go.
Aye-firmative.
If it comes to that, I'll do us both.  Let's see that it doesn't Here, I'd like to introduce you to a close personal friend of mine.
Yeah.  I've noticed.
The only way it would work is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the trip back.  Then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked.
Anytime.  Anywhere.
She survived longer than that with no weapons and no training.
Can't be.  That's inside the room!
Christ.  Some honch in a cushy office on Earth says go look at a grid reference in the middle of nowhere, we look.  They don't say why, and I don't ask.  I don't ask because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here and the answer's always 'don't ask.'
Terrible.
Cross my heart.
Gone.
Well? How do you like it? It's Turkish. My hairdresser tells me everything's going to be Turkish this year!
What?
The marriage!
Nothing! He can marry who he pleases. I don't give a damn.
Humiliated?
I want to go back to Vienna.
Now?
Yes!
Why?
Go ahead, tell him. Tell them all. They won't understand you anyway.
Yes, I think it's brilliant. You've been doing it for years.
Em iram! Em iram!
No!
Tish-I'm-tee.
Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.
Tell them to go!
Sssh. What is it? Tell me.
Tea? Who wants tea? Let's go out! This calls for a feast. You don't want tea, Papa. Let's go dancing. Papa loves parties, don't you?
What? How can you be so boring? Tea!
Wolfi, I think your father's tired. I'll cook us something here.
She won't talk to me. She says she has to speak to you.
These gentlemen are from Salzburg.
Salzburg.  We were just talking about Salzburg.  If you've come from my friend the Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. Because I've got good news for him. I'm done with Vienna. It's over, finished, done with! Done with! Done with!
That's right, Your Excellency. I've come on behalf of my hus band. I'm - I'm bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment.
Then he didn't send you?
Sir, we really need this job. We're desperate. My husband spends far more than he can ever earn. I don't mean he's lazy - he's not at all - he works all day long. It's just! he's not practical. Money simply slips through his fingers, it's really ridiculous, Your Excellency. I know you help musicians. You're famous for it. Give him just this one post. We'd be forever indebted!
He's not in. But he's working on it. He said to tell you.
He's doing his best.
Oh, now I'm a bad housekeeper!
Behold!
I am sorry, Madame, but I have my orders.
Gertrude!
People who know say the girl's got talent. You must judge for yourself. If you think she stinks, say so.
Majesty.
Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism.
Ah-ha. Favouritism. But I so want Mozart.
I think so, Sire, yes.
What do you mean, Sire?
Well, I mean occasionally it seems to have, how shall one say?  How shall one say, Director?
Yes, Sire.
Would you tell me why?
How many?
Composition doesn't pay. You know that.
It's too dangerous, Papa. But they're going to love it. Ah, there she is!
Why didn't you mention it in your letters?
Didn't I? I thought I did. I'm sure I did.
Good morning, sir.
I will, sir.
Really? What is it he's writing?
Please don't ask me to go back again. I'm frightened! I'm very, very frightened.
Are you sure it's an opera?
That's right.
My name is Lorl, sir. I'm a maidservant. I was asked to come here and offer my services to you.
I liked the horse.
Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you.
Yes.
Well, we can.
What? Ha-ha! That's funny - I like it. Which one, eh? You're a funny fellow.  Hannah! Come this way.
Madame.
Did you like it, then?
I can't say. Really
Really? Why?
Oh, Excellency, would you?
How could it not, Excellency?
A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.
Are you neglecting my request?
No, please.
Do you mean that?
Come. Let's begin.
What time?
Third measure, second beat starting on E.  Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.  And fourth measure, fourth beat - D.  Ma-le-dic-tis, flam-mis a-cri-bus ad- dic-tis.  Do you have that?
Well not especially. It can be in Turkish, if you really want. I don't care.
Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna.
A little modesty would suit you better.
Why not? It's charming. I mean, I don't actually show concubines exposing their! their! It's not indecent!  It's highly moral, Majesty. It's full of proper German virtues. I swear it. Absolutely!
Sire, only opera can do this. In a play, if more than one person speaks at the same time, it's just noise. No one can understand a word. But with music, with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once, and it's not noise - it's a perfect harmony. Isn't that marvelous?
Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.
Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.
Do you believe it?
The only thing that worried me was the actual killing. How does one do that? How does one kill a man? It's one thing to dream about it. It's very different when you have to do it, with your own hands.
Exactly.
You must be mad.
Yes, in the third act.
She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.
Bene.
Yes, indeed. Goodnight to you all now. It was perfection - truly!
You know, did he seem depressed? Do you think he'll eat the food?
Yes, Doctor.
Has his friend appeared to him again?
And what else?
David has suffered a severe trauma. I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor. If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf, why shouldn't David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf, wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon?
Dr. Hirsch?
Yes, he is. He's very excited and confused, but he's not crazy, if that's what you mean.
Yes?
You haven't eaten your lunch.
How is that?
This is absurd. I'm not hungry. I don't want any food.
I'm twenty-seven.
Ahem, A Word of Explanation. It was in Warwick Castle that I came across the curious stranger whom I am going to talk about. He attracted me by three things: his candid simplicity, his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor, and the restfulness of his company - for he did all the talking. We fell together as modest people will in the tail of the herd...
I'm sorry I woke you up.
I'm serious. You don't know me and I know nothing about you. We have a perfect relationship.
Good. I thought for a moment I was the only embarrassed one in the room.
I was dreaming again?
Yeah, I would think so, too.
Werewolves simply do not exist.
David, do you want me to stay here tonight?
Chart says he's from New York.
Why on earth do you say that?
Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
Shakespeare was French! The Queen Mother sucks cocks in hell! Shit! Fuck! Piss!
You've left my wife a widow and my children fatherless. And I understand that I am to walk the earth one of the living dead until the wolf's bloodline is severed and the curse lifted.
Yes, but does everyone kill Bambi?
You're in a hospital in London.
You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of.
No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here.
You really think I'm crazy, don't you?
David.
Oh, I don't know. I mean look around. Isn't this a fun place?
Well, anyway, do you think she'll be there?
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed wolf's head on a spear as their symbol?
Listen, at least it's warm in here.
Wrong.
It's a full moon, 'beware the moon'.
Plan?
I'm aware that I don't look so great, but I thought you'd be glad to see me.
Why should you be surprised? You were a very well-liked person.
What's wrong with you? Shut up!
You're talking like Boris Karloff! It's movie dialogue!
Nurse!
The supernatural! The powers of darkness! It's all true. Take your own life! Suicide, David. Join me.
Okay, you've seen me. Now go away.
You must take your own life now, David, before it's too late.
What about the zoo?
If you did it wrong, it would be painful. You'd choke to death.
Oh.
I beg your pardon?
Sgt. McManus, are you suggesting that David and Jack were, in fact, attacked by some animal and that the officialdom of East Proctor has conspired to keep it a secret? We have an autopsy report on the murderer who was shot in the act by the local police. We have two witnesses to the crime. You'll forgive me, Mr. Kessler, if I consider your testimony as coming from someone who has gone through a terrible shock.
I'll tell you why. I don't like the crowd you're mixed up with.  Personally, you can have all the credit you want. But for that deal - not a cent.
She's a widow. I don't like taking mortgages from widows.
Yeah. He'll have a tough time thinking up a wise-crack for this one . . .
Let me have ten bucks?
Yeah?
Oh yes, of course. There was someone with me. A lady.
What happened?  You're not a thief. How'd you get mixed up with these kind of people?
Get out, get out!
Liar! You're just suffering from lack of sleep.
Whatever it is that makes you such a riot with women.
Yes, sir.
Well, that's too bad. Mine's all right too.
Listen, dear. Now tell me the truth about this. Were you in Cluett's apartment?
Ummm. Stalling, eh?  Anything new?
I haven't got any new stories for them this morning, either.
Good morning.
Say, I know what's the matter with you. Matt!
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
Got my letter?
Say, come on. Show a little enthusiasm. What's the matter? Are you sick or something? Go on, fake it - even if it isn't real.
I'm afraid he's been stalling.
Yes, sir.
Is that busy husband of mine busy?
Come here, honey!
Oh, ten dollarsâ€
All right, I'm lying. Don't forget you called me a liar.
Oh, Matt.
It was late, I know. The Dooley sisters was already in. They work at a show, you know.
Well, about - uh - eleven o'clock.
Dammit, this stopped being fun about two years ago!
What have you done?
Swear.
Twenty?!
What are you saying?
Pass me some whisky.
Missed you too, cousin.
Must be a garrison in town. We're in occupied territory, boys.
You're right, sir.
Then why can't I go in there?
So?
Yesss, but I was thinking, I could come by, and then take Zee out. Some place near. With other folk. Near. Here.  But out.
It's fine by me, Jesse.
So we got a plan?
You could have worn one of those big, floppy woman's Easter Sunday hats.
All this time in the saddle... We get to the farm, I'm going to shoot this damn horse just on principle.
Zee, we got to talk to you and your father.
Next time try "fat and haggard."
Heard of him.
What do you think?
Shut up.  Uh, Doc, I was wondering if, uh, this evening, I could come by?
Ma.
And that's why you both lead the gang. Two of you went into that bank together, right?
Bob's upset.
Got any ideas, little brother?
Jim was old enough...
Take care of each other, boys. You say your prayers.
I've been on my back two weeks. I'm sick of it.
No! I mean, of course not. No.
Arr. Hand over your jewels, Missy.
Thank God you grew out of that.  You did grow out of that, didn't you?
Where will you find such a girl?
Aw, shucks, ma'am...
Don't swear.
Yes ma'am.
That's the idea.
I figured.
That's what I would have done.
I'd just as soon kill you, Jesse James. But chasing you takes up too much of my time.
I could have lied I suppose, but I want this marriage to be legal. I just want you to know, I'm trying to start a new life here. I'm depending on your...
No.
Not at all.
Lyla Devereux.
Don't talk about it much, though.
It's not my job to relax. I've put men facing out both ways down Main Street, so nobody can ride in shooting. I've got a sharpshooter up on the water tower just in case.
Move you fools!
Really!
Just perfect.
Thirty-five thousand, sir. Coins and currency. And the delay from the miles of destroyed track --
Can you put men at all four?
Stop it. I'm...
Pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in New York.
Dorsia's nice.
You like it there, don't you?
Is that Donald Trump's car?
Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.
This is Dorsia?
Pull out, goddamnit!
It's a plain end, see? So?
Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise.
Is your Evian spiked?
No-I can't take the time off work.
Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly.
Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk about?
But your friends are my friends. My friends are your friends. I don't think it would work.  You have a little something on your upper lip.
But what about the past? Our past?
I'm leaving now. I've assessed the situation and I'm going.
But where?
No, serial killer, Wisconsin in the fifties. He was an interesting guy.
You saw the ad in the Times?
But I think...I want to know what happened here.
Bateman killing Owen and the escort girls? Oh that s fabulous. That's rich...
Uh huh.
That's not Paul Owen. Paul Owen's on the other side of the room. Over there.
Oh, who knows? They don't know that. Prove it.
I want to get high off this; Bateman, not sprinkle it on my fucking All-Bran.
Calm down. Let's do it anyway
I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club. Anyone else?
I said "Do not wear that outfit again." Wear a dress. A skirt or something.
Thanks, Patrick.
Yes, Patrick?
Dorsia is...fine.
You didn't give them a name.
I'm on a diet. But thank you.
Well, I'd like to travel. And maybe go back to school, but I really don't know...I'm at a point in my life where there seems lo be a lot of possibilities, but I'm so... I don't know...unsure.
Maybe. I don't know Not really. Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape, twine and a nail gun.
Make someone happy-have you ever wanted to?
Thanks. It slipped my mind completely.
Hello? Jean, I need help!
Jean-I'm not-
Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong?
Why?
He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours.
You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You actually have a Whitney Houston CD? More than one?
Mr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle-
Fifty-five West Eighty-First Street. The American Gardens Building.
No problem. 
I'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing, you know.
What kind of man was he? Besides...  the information you've just given.
So was I.
Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?
Yeah, I know, and was into that whole Yale thing.
Had his apartment been burglarized?
No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it.
I mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything, right?
Great, and thanks for your, uh, time, Mr. Bateman.
And if you could try and pin down where you were the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a lot easier.
But how? Where do you place Paul that night?
Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't be sure.
Evelyn. Great ass. Goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman. What a dork.
No, Owen.
Is that a raincoat?
They still have to give 'em refreshments laced with mind-altering drugs.
Anything? That's not even credible. If he wants to go up there? To check it out? I think you should encourage him.  It's his life. But everybody's treating him like this -- valuable object. You're hurting your own case.
Milo! What about --?
He gave me some new code-fixes this morning. I said, "Did you really do this just today?" Cause I was impressed. He said "What're you implying?"
Teddy was killed last night.
"Like this?" It's Gary you're talking about.
How should I know? "Solving a problem," I guess. Or needing to control everything. I don't know.  I've gotta get in there.
I can't just walk away!
You can't just walk in, either.
So you believe me?
If I'd stayed down there, maybe this wouldn't've happened.
Don't we have any chopsticks?
He'll tell me when he gets home.
...It's -- Milo, isn't it?
You can't pre-empt Yoga, that's our biggest show.
Is it your dish?
He just likes to write code. He's bummed there's so much secrecy and competition, everybody trying to own everything.
You'd have to start practically from scratch. But this is all you'd be working on. No marketing meetings, no product seminars. We can't waste the time. Half the Valley's working on convergence. So're media conglomerates, cable companies, phone companies. 'Can't finish second, Milo. There is no second... Now what would you like to ask me?
Well -- you sent for me.
The purpose of this company isn't to destroy our competitors any more than the purpose of living is to breath. But the software business is binary: you're a zero or a one. Being obsessive isn't a crime. It's a character trait.
The wrong place?
Sure.
Longitude 109 --
It's only meaningful when you've got 40,000 lines of code to back it up.
What're we looking for?
...Were you?
Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway.
Long story. Not that interesting.
We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership. But not on our own computers. Not even at home.
A what?
Before they kill somebody else, too.
What'd he say?
That's lame, isn't it?
He suspects I know something. I think he was sort of -- explaining himself to me, in case I do.  We have to go in tonight. I'm two hours from a Beta version.  But I've gotta go home for an hour.
She called to apologize. I said I was pulling an all-nighter. She said then come home just to say Hi. Which I always do when we fight, it's suspicious if I don't.
At this point the worst thing I could do is anything out of the ordinary.
He's been altering the coordinates since we logged on. He's a step ahead. Let's jump to #12.
Outpost made me sign 1,000. 'Guess we'll find out what else we have to talk about. Life stuff.
No! I keep thinking it'll go away. But there's this -- connection. She's been hacking since she was little, she had to move around a lot. Plus I see her every day, we're working on the same program. She's -- beautiful.
I dunno. I guess Larry's got me totally suspicious of that place.
She's a programmer?
Damn. 'Have to go back over there.  Be so much easier if we could walk in the front door.
You may.
Your boss, Number Two, I understand that cat's involved in big underground drills.
Thank you, that's beautiful. To your health.
To my health.
Kiss me.
Is it about my teeth?
Damn. What exactly do you do at Virtucon?
I think it was Wordsworth who penned this little gem: 'Press the button, pull the chain, out comes a chocolate choo-choo train.'
Oh, you're very clever. Let's make love, you silly, hairy little man.
Oh, and Austin...
A lot's happened since you were frozen, Austin. The cold war's over.
You mean Mrs. Kensington?
Thank you, Exposition.
Be careful.
Yes?
What's the other?
Carnies.
Yes, Basil?
Well done, Mr. Powers. We're not so different, you and I. It's true, you're British, and I'm Belgian. You have a full head of hair, mine is slightly receding. You're thin, I'm about forty pounds overweight. OK, we are different, I'm not making a very good point. However, isn't it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very things you stand for-- swinging, free love, parties, distrust of authority- are all now, in the Nineties, considered to be... evil? Maybe we have more in common than you care to admit.
Your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan I ever dreamed of. Face it, freedom failed.
A Chigro?
Do I make you horny?
Do I make you horny? Randy, you know. To you, am I eros manifest?
We can't just sit here, Austin.
Well, you know... cows, and shagging.
Go! Just go!
Oh, yes you are.
Don't be sorry. You're right to be suspicious. I shagged her. I shagged her rotten.
Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic.
Only sailors use condoms, man.
Anyways, what I'm trying to say is that if you want me to be a one-woman man, well, that's just groovy, because... I love you.
I believe you, Austin. Let's go.
I'm telling you, baby, that's not mine.
One book: Swedish-Made Penis Enlarger Pumps and Me: This Sort of Thing Is My Bag, Baby, by Austin Powers.
Hey, wait a minute--
That's a direct order. You didn't see a thing!
Hello, Scott. I'm your father, Dr. Evil.  I have a son! I have a son! Everyone, I have a son!  Someday, Scott, this will all be yours.
I haven't seen you my whole life and now you show up and want a relationship? I hate you!
Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax.
Scott, don't say that...
Right.  Oh, hell, let's just do what we always do. Let's hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage.  Gentlemen, it's come to my attention that a breakaway Russian Republic called Kreplachistan will be transferring a nuclear warhead to the United Nations in a few days. Here's the plan. We get the warhead, and we hold the world ransom...  ...FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS!
Why?
What about his teeth?
I just don't see it.
Did you ever want to?
And how do you feel about that?
I don't wanna take over the family business.
Sir August Merryweather? I was looking for something relaxing. Say, a Tuscan hillside in June?
Normally, we'd be eager to oblige --
You don't say. How real does it feel?
... head ...
... preserve...
... love ...
So I'm still ...
Then who wins?
Ropes?
Too many cooks --
But -- why?
Right, bridesmaid. Now what have I left out? Oh, yes, I know: the ring.
Entirely. On the other hand  Mad people get things done. Let me show you --
Speaking of Peter, there's more good news: You won't even have to change your last name. You'll always be Mrs. Peel.
And now that we've settled the matter of honorifics, will you kindly explain why you wished me to meet you?
We're not here to talk about the weather, surely.
A Gentleman has to have a code. This is part of mine. A uniform. Think of it as my suit of shining armor.
Just what is your position, if you don't mind my asking.  How did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work?
I meant me.
Strange.
You were very lucky.  Four shots to the heart. I found you after I slipped away from Sir August. Mother brought you here. Not me you should thank.
How on earth can you tell?
Not that I know of.  Explanation?
Mrs. Peel ... ?
To kill me?
I thought you didn't.
If you'd been through what I have, you wouldn't --
A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...
Makes two of us.
You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ...
How come you took so much interest in her, Dr. Darling?
You're getting yourself into terrible trouble, my son. Weather's turning very nasty -- and so am I.
I'm going to follow up on a hunch of my own. If I'm right, Mrs. Peel is innocent and you have a mole.
Perish the thought.
You wish.
I'd like to jerk and press those babies.
Five thousand dollars.
Not interested.
Shit!
Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?
Keep me informed.
It's all right, I forgive you. I'm not the vengeful type. We'll forget what happened. Why don't we take a trip together? Maybe kill a few lions in Kenya over Christmas.
You know, when you dumped me for that wimp, I thought, Cole, she'll be back. God wants the two of you to be together, and sure enough...
Cole, I'm sorry, I...
What are we having?
Not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me.
I don't know... I just feel scared.
Um... that's very relaxing.
Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun shower. Use soap.
Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly.
I am committed. I love you.
You don't believe me? Okay, fine.
Yes...
Great. Now, what do you want to do about it?
You're so romantic...
Look, you heard what those hookers said. They were supposed to go to a bachelor party.
I think I screwed that one once.
Screw you!
Isn't he incredible, gets along with everybody.
Yes.
That I got. Very good women. They sit on your face, anything you want.
I need them for a bachelor party at the Park View Hotel.
That's it.
Rick!
In a second...  And you're irresponsible. Show some initiative, try to better yourself, stop showing off, actions speak louder than words.
It's all right...  So have I.
I'm not really hungry.
So long, Father.
Take care.
What can I do? I'm dead. Debbie's going to go crazy and end the whole thing.
Debbie.
Well, the first month it's great. The second month things calm down a little. By the third month you're looking through your old girlfriends' phone numbers; by the fourth month you're numb; by the fifth month, hopefully the football season starts.
Nah, listen to it. It's a pussy. It'll just steam on us. It won't flash. Go high in the ceiling.
Tim, fill out the alarm card.  Clean the pipe poles, wipe down the ladders and hang some hose.
No.  I need a drink.
Goddamn it Adcox! Just do your fucking job!
-- What the fuck were you thinking, huh? Burning people? You're a fireman.
Stevie... I...
John, when you're in there... in the fire... do you ever see...
-- Stephen, this is bullshit --
It's comin' along... want a beer?
I think you're gonna find out, Brian. Don't be late tomorrow.
What you did was drop the ball, Probie. Get that right.
Hey.
You got a problem with drilling, probie?
You said you wanted to know something, Brian. What did you learn today?  What do you say, Brian, huh? Time to move on?
Just... Just wanted to say hello...
Yeah? What have you been up to?
What, you think I just dried up and blew away when you left? The world does turn once in awhile Brian, even without your permission.
So now you suddenly care about my future?
Look, I didn't mean to take a piece out of you back there, I just thought you'd call when you came back. You didn't and...  Don't blow it just because of this garbage between us.
Yeah? Well, maybe I can fit it in...
See that trap door up there? That used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse-drawn engines. It was pretty different then... but kinda the same, y'know?
You told Swayzak about our arson lead. It's all over the fucking news.
Leave Stephen out of this --
I quit two days ago, Brian.
I don't have the slightest idea...
Who's doing this?
Trychticholorate.
After it took your dad... the fire... did it look at you Brian? Did it talk to you?...
Why backdrafts. Whoever fried Seagrave and Cosgrove went to a helluva lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire, but also made sure the fire blew itself out.
Did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report. They did exactly one job -- Swayzak's manpower study. It's not even really a company. No employees, no directors, just a PO Box.
How ya feeling?
Another couple of good men get burned up for their city? Is that how it's going to read?  You're the only one that knows.
Four months?
Stephen's not staying here now, Brian. He moved out last April.
You guys ought to try picking up a phone once in awhile.
No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin.
I have a job.
Yeah, we got all kinds of traditions -- like dying young.
You crooked son of a bitch. Why 115?
Ah man, if you're gonna bribe your way into a station, why not 17 with me and your brother?
Swayzak's not my boss.
Cute.
I'll be there, goddamn it!
Oh yeah? How's he doing?
Sorry I hit Jackson.
Hey, I'm the first one to admit when I'm wrong.
Stephen... I... can I talk to you a second...
Putty? On both doors?
He works for me.
Oh, but it's a good story, Shadow. You're depriving our famous young friend here...
And old ladies?
I need to get in the trunk.
Alderman.
You believe that man is the be-all and end-all?
You mean you could use it.
Yes.
I forgive you.
All right. What are you gonna do?
I want 15 on the Mets.
He's gonna kill you, man. Do you hear me, motherfucker? You. Dead. Get it?
You've really got a problem.
Yesterday morning, God gave me but one chance to use something else to serve Him. Not my arms or my legs, but something I used for the first time, for the last time, and will never use again. My vagina.
Yeah, him.
What's your name?
Moorish.  Ya get a little taste of dat booty, ya wanna get some MORE.
Jim Jones, y'know.  I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
You can walk away.  We both can.
Hurry up, I wanna watch HBO.
Yo, you gotta show some patience. You want me to snap my fingers and presto chango - you're an overnight sensation.  Son, there is no such thing.
I'm tired of waiting.
We was coming to see you.
We're starving.
Why?
Mantan!!
No matter how sexist or racist the material may be?
I wasn't told about this until Marie informed me as soon as I got off the elevator.
That's exactly what I think.  I want you to create something that people want to see.  Let's be honest, the majority of the people in the country are deaf, dumb and blind and I'm including 35 million African-Americans.  You know and I know "niggers" set the trend, set the styles.  This is a golden opportunity now.  These idiots have to be led to the water.
Mantan is an uneducated Negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire.
Ya first bad move.  Projects been done.  That's one of the problems now, everything, movies, TV, are set in the urban jungle, da hood. That's so tired.  Mantan's Millennium Minstrel Show should be set on a plantation.  In Alabama. 
We think so.
You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot?
If Spielburg can direct "The Color Purple" and "Amistad", our whiz kid can direct the Mantan pilot.
Dunwitty, don't leave.
Go away, unless you got my money.
I thought you had promised Mommy you stopped.
In life?  I'ma keep on living, having a good drink, got me a good young woman, make a couple of dollars and make people laugh. Haven't I always tol' you all nigga's are entertainers?  The question is what are you gonna do, Peerless?
What good are you if you don't tell me stuff like this?
It wasn't my fault.  If I would have known, I would have known.
The idea was out there in the universe.  Now what?
Do you know how you will use him?
Not yet, but this thing will never get made.
Sounds risky to me.
It was the principle.  Dunwitty had to be enlightened.  I was making a point.  I take pride in my work. Plus, I already told you I wasn't gonna walk away from my money.
Fuck da money.  Why do through all this effort?  Why?  Are you looking for love from Dunwitty?  For respect?  Dunwitty and his likes don't give a goddamn about you.  So now what are you gonna do?
I'm gonna slit my wrists.  Cut my throat.  For the love of Joseph.
What do you want me to say?
For what?
He, I'm Mona.
I perfectly understand where you're coming from.  As a minority I can relate to your struggle also.  But I think you should give us all a chance.  We want this pilot to be successful just as much as you. Please don't be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness.
Sloan is the hardest working person I've ever met.
Can't beat it with a hammer.  Well, since you asked, it looks like I may have a new show, a pilot being shot.
Please let me know when you hear from Daddy, get a number or something.
You know how your Daddy is.
You've never had any formal training, either?
Why do you say that?  You've never seen me.
I admit, that's a very hard thing to do.  Quickly let's go to the phones before we pay the bills and hear from our proud sponsors, DA BOMB.  125% PURE PLEASURE MALT LIQUOR.  IT MAKES YOU WANNA GET YA FREAK ON AND TIMMI HILLNIGGER. 125% AUTHENTIC GIT-TOE GEAR WHEN YOU WANT TO BE GIT-TOED FABULOUS. 
And this is my very best friend Mantan.
Our Alabamy Home.  Now we're getting countrified.  We is Bama's.
...to big.  The in-between one, not too tight, not too lose.
...like grits and butter...
Mantan, it is possible that my hyphenated sentences are entirely too complex for all the intellect contained in that diminutive coconut?
The good stuff.
Are you trying to rap to me?
Y'know, at the beginnin' of the century, African-American had to perform in blackface.  You ever heard of Bert Williams?  He was a great artist.
My people love me.
Oh, you gonna make me say it.
We did it one time, only once.  It had nothing to do with the job, it was stupid.  Everything I've got I've earned.
You know the use of arms very well, Best, and no one can doubt your courage; but Michael and I will see you home for all that.
Sir, I'm a British officer.
Neither!
Mark this, come what will of it, I swear I will fight the man who pretends to the hand of Dorothy Dugan.  I'll follow him if it's into the church, and meet him there. I'll have his blood, or he shall have mine.  Will you take my message to him, and arrange the meeting?
In faith, I believe you are not; for a lad I never saw more game in my life.  Give me a kiss, my dear boy. You're after my own soul.  As long as Jack Grogan lives, you shall never want a friend or a second.
I'll match any man with the sword.
I don't know.
Then ordering fresh horses, the Chevalier set off on his journey for that capital.  I need not tell you that I was the Chevalier.
Certain?
That is a trifle strong.
Never.
Always, my dear one, never any further.  Love is a child to be pacified with trifles.  A full diet can only kill it.
O, my dearest love.  Enough!  I beg you.  Stop believing in your experience.  You have never known love.  My very soul is leaving me! Catch it on your lips, and give me yours!
Old fool!
It is entirely up to you.  I want the best.
In so far as I can tell these things -- no.  I believe the Chevalier won the money fairly.
What is to be done?
Brooksy was better than you, papa, he used not to swear so, and he taught me many good things while you were away.
Who?
What do we do?
None of that matters now. We got two dead bodies and a story that explains them. You're either with us, or against us -- which is it?
Before or after the explosion?  Mueller --
Tell me about them.
Of course --
They would have killed us both. You want me to write a confession, I'll write a confession.
Tell us about the other guys, the ones West weeded out.
Mueller was alone in the cabin?
Just a guess. Maybe they're not where they're supposed to be. Maybe somebody moved them. Habeas Corpus -- no bodies, no crime, and Nunez still plays as self defense. Face it detectives... you have nothing.
Sir, Dunbar, sir!
Why?
West... he's dead.
We just want to check your pack --
Why?
Just look. Little pocket.
That's close range. You go full auto on a guy from close range, you're gonna be swimming in blood. Look at my uniform. Nothing.
They?
What happened to "degrees"?
But you didn't.
Maybe he...
Tell me what I can do.
It's not West, is it? Tell me it's not West.
Well, he's a good soldier.
If you let him testify then it would have all come out. West was supposed to take care of it out there, shut Nunez up and then disappear. But it got messy and people got killed. So you called your old pal Tom Hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you.
You're drunk --
I'm not going to cover for you, Bill. Not for this.
Get your hands away from the desk!
You and the Colonel go back.
Subtlety really isn't one of you finer points, is it, Osborne?
Hurricane knocked out our Mainframe, so all we have are their dogtags. Cadets Raymond Dunbar and Levi Kendall --
You had a mobile of bayonets above your crib.
Yeah. That's just the story I tell the girls to get them into bed. Truth is... I don't know. The whole honor and duty thing. Make a difference in the world, crap like that. Didn't really work out.
Being back here. Gives me the willies.
Got it.
What?
They believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent.
And all hell breaks loose. A lot of Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending.
Positive. Hardy, they planned this.
You mean the falsely accused?
So did I.
Good, just making sure.
Hardy, for Chrissakes --
Think it'll work?
"You're gonna die tonight, faggot". Clear as day.
It will and you know why? Because you're not a person anymore, you're a cadet in the United States Army; you have no identity, no Miranda warning, and no rights. So I'm gonna throw you to the wolves, and unlike you, I'm gonna get away with it, because you're pissing me off!
Childs.
I used it to start the fire --
We're not going anywhere.
You are to be stripped of all weapons and placed under guard --
I called the JAG Corps, the two cadets we retrieved are to be flown to D.C. on a transport leaving here at 1700 --
The army kicked you out for drugs...
Sir, yes, sir!
Good luck, kid.
The poet? What ever happened to him?
Dr. Bennett. It's good to see you.  My wife, Josephine.
How did you know?
So I've heard.
Really?
Wouldn't lie to you. And they've got all-you-can-eat buffets. You can eat a lot, can't you?
You owe me three-fifty.
I will.
Dad!
What?
I have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact.
You think I'm fake.
Like this.
But you're wrong. I do know you, at least by reputation. Edward Bloom from Ashton. See, I'm actually engaged to a boy from Ashton. Don Price. He was a few years older than you.
I wasn't expecting you.
Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was expecting to dance around this for another half hour.
My father talked about a lot of things he never did, and I'm sure he did a lot of things he never talked about. I'm just trying to reconcile the two.
You didn't become crazy.
I need to lie down for a bit.
What is "true?" I've never heard my father say a single true thing.
Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.
He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat.
We'll stop then.
You heard what I said. I'm pregnant. I've been throwing up for weeks.
No I haven't.
Right.
Uh... Yes.
And...
And what? You mean from the beginning? Jesus. Can I uh okay, as we say in Russia can I cut a long story short. Okay. Nadia is my little cousin. Except she's not. But we say cousin. This is for you.
Toast first then we talk seriously, I can see you are serious about us.
Right.
I asked her if you were happy to see us. I find it hard to tell with you.
Tell me.
It's very strange. How many people are truly themselves with their love? It is the greatest human disaster and it is never in the newspapers. There are no Marches Against Heartache, no Ministries Against Loneliness, no Concerts Against Disappointment. We look away. And still we know in secret that nothing is more important to us. The one thing we all share but don't say. Look John I will show you something.
I'm pretty nervous. Are you?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Syevodnya
You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt already.
Well, Nadia, It it's all the same to you, I'd like to give it a bash.
What?
I'm going to be sick. Where's the...
I'm going... I am... I'm going to be sick.
Yes.
I said I don't have any.
Fine. Absolutely. Must be disappointing though. Must come as a hell of a shock.
Excuse me?
And? What are you saying?
And that would be Morals. That would be one's own moral sense of decency.
Whereas "Wet 'n' Wild" is an emotional journey. "Tied and Tethered". It's pretty moving huh? Like Anna Karenina.
Not really. Maybe a little.
Except for Small Eyes.
No. I think I better just go.
Thanks.
You hurt it?
You take her to a doctor?
No. No, she can't go. Mean to say... they's just no money fo'a doctor. Her daddy left for a job, and uh... give her to me to look on. I just...  I don't know what to do.
Mm-hm. I don't know if I got a good voice or not but... practice is only on Mondays and Wednesdays, so...
Hey. You wasn't at'cha work but that nosey gal up at the counter give me your home address. Hope you don't mind me comin' over.
I need ya help again.
Why you stop havin' dancin' on Saturday? Used to have bands... all kind's live shit. Like a wake up in here, now.
Cuz let me tell you, you boys gotta run the ball more. You get into a kicking game, ya'll gonna lose.
Sit down, man. Need a beer?
The only thing that cunt's had behind her is me and half the town fuckin' her.  Your first night away, I come over and drop off the spare keys like you wanted me to. You weren't gone two hours and she was aching to get me inside her. Like she was havin' some kind'a fit.
Can't be thinkin' bout him every second of my day. I'll go outta my gourd.
Here. Pound this and I'll join you.
If you come to talk about that muthafucka, I'm gonna get up and leave you sittin' pretty in that new suit he bought'cha.
Carryin' on behind my back. Make me out to look like a fool to all our people. Tell me, what's friendly about that?
Better than what you give.
Laz... You can't say nothin'...
LAZ, I said let...!
Tehronne? Tehronne done this?
Wait. He left.
Naw'sir... I gotta be on my way.
Best try gettin' ya wits about you 'fore you try to...
We got everything we need. Plenty of food. Ya medicine still got a few good swallows in it...
In my house, you watch that lip...
Itches.
If all you got is filth comin' out'cha mouth... people just gonna tune ya out.  Rae. RAE! I'm not fightin' with ya. I just know you got more in you than junk.  Now, you sayin' you don't know how to cook anything at all?  You know how to boil water?
By myself?
I know you didn't. But you a grown girl. You can handle it. I got to.
She a freak. Got what you call a sexual addiction.
You gonna preach 'bout turnin' the other cheek?
I'm tellin' you the truth, dammit. I found her beat. Left for dead. So I brung her home.
Yes'sir.
That's between her and me. It's private. And I don't want you goin' off and tellin' ya daddy.
What's on your mind?
Let go...
It's not regulation.  And the only way you're gonna stop anybody with it is to show it to him, and while he's laughing, you can shove it down his throat.
-- I should tear your head off.
What?
Hey, come on, big guy like you, cop from New York.  You're gonna be the biggest thing to hit town since Godzilla.
I'd feel better if we had some heat.
Maybe we should bail?
Pussy, ass, soft personnel.
All right, how's the new partner?
The mayor's office, under the bed, the back room at Lombardi's.  And call me Ich.
What's the problem here?
Why weren't you at the platform?
Broiled fish paste cake, Kelp roll, soybean curd, devils tongue --
I want to yank Kobo.
For Sugai.  Caviar, French cheese, ham... If you come to apologize for interrupting his meeting, Sugai may feel obligated to see you.
So I bring some cheese?
I called Ohashi, he'll be waiting.  I like him waiting.
An outside person.  A foreigner.  A barbarian.  You, me.  More you.
I need someone to translate for me.
My Japanese isn't that hot... Besides, you'll never get in.
This little guy thinks you're Robert Redford... the other one thinks you're Charles Bronson...
Bullshit, Nick.  And don't tell me this is all just about Charlie. It's not.
Thought you knew your way around dark alleys, detective.
Do you know what this is?
Why don't you ask your chief detective?
If anything happens to her while I'm here --
He'll find out you took me.  I'm unprotected.  He'll kill us.  All of us.  You don't stand a chance.
Anywhere.
Can the maker repair what he makes?
Death.
I'm afraid that's a little out of my...
Come here.
What about E.M.S. recombination?
If it wouldn't be too much of a bother... a little bite to eat would be...
You're just all so... so different.
Like what?
I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out of my league.
Dr. Tyrell?
He could?
Be better if I could talk to him in person.  But he's not an easy man to get to.
Thank you.
This is Bryant.  Are you alone?
Got it.
Do you have something against science?
Not if it works.
I don't know.
I'm doing okay.
These aren't just...
Of course.
What's suck night?
Silicone Valley.  Lots of these science guys never leave that place.  We book two shows a month in there. Those big time techs and bio- guys might be real high zoners up here, but when it comes to the arts, they like it loud and lewd.
You have a little boy.  He shows you his butterfly collection, plus the killing jar.
So, I'm a piece of equipment. Use me.
Not too good.
Yeah.  Sometimes.
I wish I could.
Good for a smart girl to feel stupid.  Part of your education.
I never felt better.
What's a long time?
Please.
Pris.
What about friends?
I've got stuff.  If you wanna go to my place?
What's your problem?
Is that why you're still here?
Good.
He's really funny!
My office.
For how long?
I do fine, Adam.  How 'bout yourself?  You doin' any good?
Shallow? I'm shallow?!
We? I'm going home. And, judging by that coat, I'd say you have to get back to the barber college.
Oh, that's nice.
Yes, I'm right?
Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn?
It was amazing.
Get away from me!!
Yes.
I don't have to take a physical in your space ship?
Okay.  What the hell?  You got a deal. Get in.
Over this?
Thank-Q!
Oh, stop that!  God! Listen, I know you like me.  I can tell. But you know what? A lot of guys like me.  Not me, exactly. It's more like the legs or the butt or the hair.  Or some combination of the above.
Two weeks.
I guess we'll need another locker.
Then forget it.
You can be single and not alone. Marriage bites!
Well, I could probably get you laid in two weeks, but to locate a non-mutant wife from Pasadena...that could take some time.
I'm seeing...snow... lots of snow. Way up North.  Are we getting hot?
Yes!
Good for you.
May I please be excused?
Wazoo!  Try to listen.  Whataya think? Surfer, grunge, hip- hop, Euro trash?
Okay. But you know, this business of finding you a wife -- it's kind of ridiculous, don't you think?
And don't be so obvious!
No way.
Adam!  She's got bitch written all over her!  You do know what "bitch" means, don't you?
How 'bout this one?
Maybe. But that's how it works.
I want to know exactly who you are and what you're really up to!
What in the hell are you doing here!! You're supposed to be over on San Vicente Boulevard having unsafe sex with that slut Sophie!!
I know...and I'm really sorry.
Look! I'm limping!  How attractive is that?!  What if this is for life?!
Sing it to me.
My pleasure.
My mother's like that.
Yes, it is.
Gee-ma-nee!
Yes!  Yes!  Oh, Lord!  Yes, oh, yes! But  where is the one who came last night -- all in yellow?!
Archbishop Melker. We met earlier.
Tempus fugit!
It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now.
No kidding!
One more thing. If you find a healthy young woman, bring her back with you.
I do? Well, thank you! You like ceilings?
Maybe Eve can guess.  She's psychic.
She's right?!
1959.
Russia.
Oh, yes.  It would probably kill him.
Why not? He has great pants.
I LOVE THIS!!
Ladies first, Troy! That was close.
So, did you buy a movie?
No, I wouldn't go in one of those places with a gas mask on.
Does that work?
No kiddin'. Well...good night.
You don't look thirty-five.
How old do I look?
Frozen, they're six-thirty a dozen in the three pound box.
Say what?!
Really? No kidding?
Heck, I know that mom! You're my parents.
No!  Not the police!  Don't call them!
What about relatives?
Yes, yes, the song.  So tell me...has it been...hell up here?
Yes, I can tell that just looking around.  "Boy?"  Did you say you were a "country boy?"
Time? Oh, no Calvin. It's not time yet. I still have--
Now you listen to me Calvin Webber, when this baby comes, you're going to be out in the waiting room smoking yourself to death with all the other fathers.
As long as we've got that straight.
Thirty -five years!
We have to be strong, sweetheart. If not for ourselves, for the child.
Uh, oh. Now it's time.
No, Calvin.  Babies cry.
What? Whatever you want, Helen!
You bet.
I know exactly what you mean!  Hey, honey?
Mutants?!
We do?
Well, I am the head of this household--
Well, that's...considerably shorter than before.  I was wondering, Calvin, why set the locks at all.  I mean the radiation is gone and...
Your stuff?  Let me see that.
Hey, they're Ralph Laurens.  And who's this interesting looking fellow?
This is Adam.  Adam, meet Cliff.
I see "elegant."
Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?
Let me show you the entire trousseau!
Adam,  I think for you, we should go for "sweet."
Uh, yes, you do.
He thinks that I am a gentleman and that you are a lady!
What?!
We came back to the house!
No. No, wait a minute. We stopped at a porno store.
The SAR HELO is airborne with you in sight.
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
Aunt Barbara. I'll try not to get depressed.
Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look, I better go.
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. For instance, many marriages are saved by.
Come on. I'll drive you home. It's on my way.
Yeah. I get it.
We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.
I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you.
You said hello, to Frank. You wanted to talk to someone? Don? And little Donny. You said something about Momma loves you. And something about a Meadow Lane. Something in an hour. I don't remember any more.
Sure I'm alright. 
What?
Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.
Yeah, hurry up though.
There you go again. Stop saying that. You can make it.
Falling.
I came back to help you. You said do I let girls sneak into my house. You know where I live. If you need to, come to where I live, OK?
No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. Go to the police.
Does that scare you?
I asked first.
It's okay. It's okay.
He's comin' back? What for?
Oh he forced you, huh?
Okay, I'm goin'. You'll see, I'll get you.
Mommy's here.
He's a friend. From the neighborhood. We were just talking.
Go where?
On a ride.
FUCK THAT SHIT. PABST BLUE RIBBON!!!
Be right down.
I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
Do you want the car?
Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
Sure thing, please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
I'll get a coat for her.
I mean, some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
Hey Jeff.
Uh-uh.
Good deal Dad.
Yeah. What are you doing now?
Come on, you brought it up. Do you know anything?
Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
Where are they?
I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
Yeah. Good bye.
Just a minute, pull over and wait a minute.
Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. Aren't you curious about my plan?
Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
Yeah, if it opens the door.
I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
This is not my usual Friday night!
Leave it in the front of your house for me, okay?
Oh, okay, can I call?
You saw a lot in one night.
That's what I thought.
You better not, Jeffrey.
Okay, okay.
Yeah, but I don't think it's going to do much good. Let's go. I'll try to talk to him later.
I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
You look beautiful.
I like that idea, that's a real good idea.
Just a minute.
Probably not. No. Why?
Shhh. I'll tell you.
Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.
You shut up. Nobody's talkin' to you. Hey who's that Jeffrey? Your mother?
Any word back from the E.R.s?
He probably knew you'd end up nailing the fat guy, maybe one or two more, but he had to know you weren't walking out of there. Figure it out. Shooter's dead on the scene. No in-depth investigation. It'd slide right off his back. 'Cause as much as I love ya, you're not exactly Don Corleone. What would he be losing? A thirty- five year old delivery boy?
No. No man. That's... that's... you don't know what you're talking about. That's bullshit. I know these guys. I mean, thanks for your concern, but that just ain't the thing of it.
C'mon!
Well, I didn't but...
Know any other languages?
We're going to hit Poppa Joe tonight, right in the comfort of his own home. Then we move on to New York. It's getting a bit hot for us here.
Ass!
"We just got up and left. Bum musta rolled them before the police got there."
Oh, you've lost it, haven't ya?
Me too. That's stupid. Name one thing we're gonna need it for.
Aye.
Each day we will spill their blood till it rains down from the skies.
Uh... two shooters!
Of course they were. How many?
I killed your fuckin' cat, you druggie bitch!
My, my...
New hitman wants to leave his mark
Okay, seriously, both you listen ta me now.
Hallelujah, Jaffar.
Who says that? You could take credit on it.
Roc. You okay?
Fine! Fuck it! When we're done she can I.D. me. I don't care. Just tryin' to be professional, but no...
Those who do not act are in a constant state of ethical indecision.
You know them personally?
Yeah boss?
Plus where's Huggie Bear?
That's true. But what if they change the locks?
I know about money, Anthony. I know the value of money. Plus the earrings are worth three times that.
That's not bad.
Nothing. Go ahead.
You're out! I'm not working with either one of you!
Unlock that door.  Check the aisles.
Look at the treads on those.
I'll say it.
Actually. If you knew the exact route, you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over.
As long as he gets out OK.
Where was I?
He told you and you let him do it.
He told me because he wanted to know if I wanted to go.
If you wanted to go? What were you going to do? Just leave me here by myself?
No. I'm going to swim. I'll see you later.
Can you hand me those french fries.
I don't really feel like talking about it. The only thing I feel like is getting the fuck out of this place.
You don't know how to hotwire.
A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!
Shut up!
Right. Freezers. Imported foods.
Yeah. As a girl.
Yes. I do.
Roger.
It's the fire alarm. Somebody pulled the fire alarm.
I don't know.
I'll see you there.
What are you talking about?
Can't remember shit. CRS.
You got to be kidding me.
We're not sure yet. It's going to need some repairs.
Have the car running at the north- west checkpoint. Bob and I'll --
I'm not really sure. I think it's Irish. Or maybe --
Are you afraid?
I hope not.
And if Future Man doesn't get let out of jail in 48 hours, then we go back. All right?
Why not?
I know it must of been a bad experience. But it doesn't sound like it was your fault.
Were you adopted, Bob?
Jesus Christ! No.
Hopscotch. The code name is hopscotch.
Where were you?
We might have to take that chance. Cause I feel pretty strongly about this.
Wait a second.
Yeah.
Hell, no. This is a '72. I was driving a '63 Pontiac.
I don't know about that.
That never would of --
As much as I want. When these plants bud I'll probably have about six thousand dollars worth of weed.
What did I say?
I know that now. He's a fucking psycho.
He electrocuted someone?
It was an accidental. I don't want to go into the details. It was just one of those senior pranks that didn't really go right. I mean, obviously, since Swifty's dead. That's why Anthony never graduated.
Be cool, Bob. Be cool.  Make that light.
So it's my fault?
There were more than that.
What are you talking about?
So tell them the truth. What do you use it for?
This could be a trap.
You don't even know his name.
Yeah. It is.
Bullshit.
Look. We want you on the job.
Who's watching the door? What the fuck are you doing? Get back in position.
Let's go!
No. I have a cellmate. His name's Carl.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me.
This boy's a troublemaker. He used to tear this place apart.
He said you ran away from home.
Oh, yeah.
Sure.
Si. Tecate. You like to fight?
What?
Fight. You know.
Fuck you. You a Hoto.
I'll say. You killed his goddam girlfriend instead. Now they're onto Neski. They're at the Brecker Hotel even as we speak.
One last push. One.
Never heard of it.
And you do? From the moment he left Treadstone, he has killed and eluded every person that you sent to find him...
Oh, God... It must have been Bourne.
You put a four-gam Kel on here and it's gonna take out power to the building. You know that. What you can't know, is if it's gonna blow the room with it.
Jesus...
Something's been going on here in Europe. And it's still going on. Post Conklin. Who's been in Berlin?
Yes...
I killed them.
-- what? --
-- make the left -- toward the bridge --
Last week an Agency field officer went to make a buy from a Russian national.
Last week? When?
Why you're alive?  You're alive because you're special. Because she kept you alive.  Because we want you back on our side.
But we can relax. We tracked him. He's on a train to Moscow.
Is there. Is all there.
You were his local contact. You were with him the night Conklin died. You're coming with us.
So?
Yup...  The main word there, the file heading, translates as: Treadstone.
By who?
What it means in England -- and in Scotland too -- is that rebels have forfeited their lands. We were ambushed last night. But the Scots dragged their dead away.
With cavalry -- not heavy, like the English, but light, fast horsemen, like you nobles employ -- we could outmaneuver their bowmen!
You directed me to report to you the moment the king's conference was ended.
Look at me. I said LOOK AT ME!
That's just a dream, William!
Armed?
Aye, we'll get 'em.
You win.
Call it a test of soldiery, then. The English won't let us train with weapons, so we train with stones.
In order to find his equal, and Irishman is forced to talk to God.  Yes, Father!...  The Almighty says don't change the subject, just answer the fookin' question.
A common thief.
They used hounds on us in Ireland, it's the only way!
All men lose heart. All betray. It is exactly why we must make the choices we make.
Your pardon, M'lord, he asked me to come in his stead.
If he wants his queen to rule, then you stay and learn how! I will deal with him.
I do not confess.
But I won't give you up to any nobleman.
How do you know this?
A magistrate wished to capture him, and found he had a secret lover, so he cut the girl's throat to tempt Wallace to fight -- and fight he did.
York was the staging point for every invasion of my country. And that royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots, even women and children, from the city walls.
That is not possible.
SLAVES ARE MADE IN SUCH WAYS!
I have taken vows. More than one. I've vowed faithfulness to my husband, and sworn to give him a son. And I cannot keep both promises.
If I swear to him, then everything I am is dead already.
No English lord would trust an Irishman!
Hold it, hold it, Andrea. Let's not jump to conclusions. I'll run some preliminary tests, see what we can rule out.
Come on, I doubt the answer's that simple.
How soon?...
Good. Because I've been waiting to see your art projects all week and I'd feel terrible if all you thought about was your father not being there.
I... I don't remember.
Something must've happened! What set him off?
Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades?
And then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could...
How long will I be in here?
He's saying it's like forty years worth of new memories have been jammed in my brain since last year. Overload city. 'Sat about the gist of it, doc?
You told me that on Parents' Weekend. Remember? Wait, that wasn't me. Or you.
I'm standing next to Kayleigh, my hands are over her ears.
I can't... the car vanishes and all of a sudden I'm on the ground in the woods.
Where are my goddamn books?
You remind me of your father. He always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one.
All I know is that I might be able to unblock some of my repressed memories.
What?
What are you talking about? What you deserve is a better brother and father. All they do is make you feel like shit.
Of course.
Well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular. It'd be a big help.
I know, but...
You can't hate yourself just because your dad's a twisted freak.
The bottom. When you're just a piece of meat waiting for the next attack.
I never thought you would. That's why I've never bothered to tell a soul until now, and why I never will again.
Anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that.
That I didn't leave you there to rot.
I still owe you an essay from last week. Is there any way I could get an extension?
It was like Tommy was possessed or something. There was a hate in his eyes that I couldn't really call human.
Sure. I was gonna make a new one, anyway.
Yeah, good, what else do you remember?
If I hadn't blown my arms off, Mom never woulda started smoking in the first place. Now shhhh.
No one thinks you're a piece of shit, Tommy.
Where the hell are you taking us anyway? Just blow something up already.
Could I speak to you for just a moment, please?
He is? Well, Captain Renault's getting broadminded. Sit down. Will you have a drink?
No.
Oh, but if you knew what it means to us to leave Europe, to get to America! Oh, but if Jan should find out! He is such a boy. In many ways I am so much older than he is.
Yes, well, everybody in Casablanca has problems. Yours may work out. You'll excuse me.
Berger, Norwegian, and at your service, sir.
Yes, sir.
I'd better be going.
It's not for sale.
I have a proposition for whoever has those letters. I will handle the entire transaction, get rid of the letters, take all the risk, for a small percentage.
And the carrying charges?
I shall remember to pay it... to myself.
Signor Ferrari thinks it might just be possible to get an exit visa for you.
Good day.
You needn't be concerned about me.
Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me.
I will.
I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me.
Yes, of course, we --
Especially tonight.
Well, I'm not running away any more. I'm settled now, above a saloon, it's true, but... walk up a flight. I'll be expecting you.
Put them on the table.
For the last time, put them on the table.
Now? I don't know. I know that I'll never have the strength to leave you again.
But what about us?
Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge.
Yes, ma'am.
You used to be a much better liar, Sam.
Play it, Sam. Play "As Time Goes By."
Goodnight.
We'll discuss it later.
Victor, please, don't go to the underground meeting tonight.
Apparently he has the letters.
He suggested I ask you.
-- Yes?
No, Victor, there isn't.
One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca.
Thank you. I try.
Go ahead.
What of it?
My wife?
Yes.
But you didn't know she was at my place last night when you were. She came there for the letters of transit. Isn't that true, Ilsa?
Here it is.
Goodnight.
Captain Renault, I am under your authority. Is it your order that we come to your office?
Whether or not you succeed is, of course, problematical.
Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.
Realizing the importance of the case, my men are rounding up twice the usual number of suspects.
Thank you.
But we mustn't underestimate American blundering. I was with them when they "blundered" into Berlin in 1918.
I have no conviction, if that's what you mean. I blow with the wind, and the prevailing wind happens to be from Vichy.
And if it should change?
Uh, huh. I have been thinking. It is too dangerous if we let him go. It may be too dangerous if we let him stay.
My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.
What, again?
It is my duty to see that he doesn't impress the other half. Rick, Laszlo must never reach America. He stays in Casablanca.
I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back.
He'll take one.
Because, my dear Ricky, I suspect that under that cynical shell you're at heart a sentimentalist.
Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here.
Excuse me.
Huh?
Ilsa Lund.  That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape. The last man I want to see in America.
It certainly would. Germany... Vichy would be very grateful.
I thought I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
Serves me right for not being musical.
As soon as the plane goes, Louis.
Maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start.
I'm a drunkard.
I haven't the slightest idea.
My interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one.
No.
Well, Rick, after tonight I'll be through with the whole business, and I am leaving finally this Casablanca.
For how long?
Get up, damn you.
No water, no work.
If I don't have a sea anchor I'll capsize.
Grow up, stop being such a baby.  Other people get through a lot worse.
Shut up.  I don't feel like dying today.
As much as anybody.
Want to come in?  Get dry for a minute.
He was a sorry sonofabitch, and I'm sorry I ever married him.
So do I.
Chuck, forget the Xerox.  So Russia didn't turn out well?
Yeah, tell me.  Tell me all of it.
I have to.
Malaysia.  They're holding the sweep.
I would never --
Yeah?
I didn't know what really being alone was.  No one back here does.
That's what I told the fish I caught. But I ate them anyway.
I'm so glad you're alive.
Dehydration.  Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency.  Any or all of the above.
All I ate was fish.  That's solid protein.
But all that's behind me.  I'm fine now.
Come on down to the plant.  It's state of the art.  We're doing for chickens what FedEx did for the delivery business.
Don't you even think about it.
What's going on down there?
But I might not have.
You fucked us over.
Forget it.
I braided them.
Finish what you started.  You haven't changed, Chuck.  It's still you.
No sweat.
Permission granted.
May I ask, where are you bound?
San Francisco.  And you?
Try to think of nothing, Dorothy.
One has to be more than "careful" of Mrs. Goodhall--she has sufficient Christian zeal to start her own country! I'd like to give her a little ether.
"An internship and two years of training at the Boston Lying-in, South End Branch. For his age, he was judged an accomplished gynecological obstetrical surgeon; he is also experienced in pediatric care..."
I just hope he won't expect us to say *Grace* all the time.
Daddy, it's a letter to *me*.
Two.
I can't have a baby alone. I don't even know if he's coming back!
When I'm not thinking about Wally. I'm not good at being alone.  Oh, goodness. You meant... yes, I'm fine. I...  ...I don't suppose you've seen a lobster yet.
Well, she was in a weakened condition...  I don't know! What about "King Kong"?! Is that medically possible?
Ah-ha.  So what is that--a radio?
Nobody will swim here until next summer. By then, the water will have rubbed the glass smooth against the sand--there won't be any sharp edges.
We have to wait and see. I think that, for *everything* in life, you have to wait and see.
No! That's not all there is to it! I love you, too--I *know* I do.
Well, we have to help her!
*Go* anywhere? Of course not! That would be *doing* something, wouldn't it? We wouldn't want to *do* something. Let's just sit here all night!
Please don't...
No. You warned me. I didn't listen, but you warned me.
Hi...
I don't need no more clothes, thank you.
Homer was born *here*, in, what was it, 1922?
Cirrhosis--it's a disease of the liver.
She's dead now, too. She was a nanny.
That's why Kong loves her!
It looks like you bit it--it'll be all right.
No, you did it yourself. Maybe in your sleep.
We're heading back to Cape Kenneth.
The only jobs are picking jobs. Picking apples is truly boring.
*And* over the Himalayas. That's called flying over the hump.
The trees are flak--antiaircraft fire from those geeks on the ground.
Homer, you the only one who's read them rules, so you the only one who feels like he's doin' somethin' wrong.
This is easy--I'm not hurrying.
You're lying. How can you... with your own daughter!
There ain't no *almost* about this stuff, Homer--ain't that right?
That's 'cause I sticked my *own* knife in the wound--after she go, I sticked my *own* knife in there. I poked it all around, I just tryin' to find the same place she got me.
Scurvy! Ah yes, the curse of the old- time sailor, suffering long periods at sea with no fresh fruits or vegetables. Homer, Dorothy isn't a *sailor*!
Nobody's named this one yet.
It's my turn!
Can't a boy be a Dorrit?
Of course.
You know everything I know, plus what you've taught yourself--you're a better doctor then I am and you know it!
Pretty, ain't it? You a plumber?
I guess you must like watchin' me be sick...
You think so, Jack? Well... I wouldn't want to be in that Wally's shoes tonight.
Anyway, I was just showing you this guy as an example of what's available-- I didn't think you'd be interested.
We see you next harvest.
Then you pickin' 'em too fast--they ain't no better than drops to me. See that bruise, and that one? *Half* of these is bruised! Look at this one! It ain't got no stem! You might as well *step* on 'em, too--they only good for cider.
That's right--that sounds like trouble to me.
Now, now, darlin'... Jack just needs to know what business he's in.
I wasn't sure if you'd make it.
Uh, Maker's Mark. Rocks.
Right. The guys who started that did what a lot of companies in the Valley do. They get a good idea, shop it around, raise some capital, then sell it off to a bigger company. Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, whatever. The beauty of it is, they've pretty much sold the company before they're even real. The bigger company is already set to buy it, all they want to do is make sure that the idea actually works. So they get some start up capital, make it work, then sell it for like five times the initial loan.
You never know when you can use a crooked cop.
Keep going. I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby.
Factors that weren't clear to me until now.
Cue the fucking violins. Come on... It's getting cold.
You know when the first con was ever played? It was when Adam fell for Eve in the Garden of Eden.
Mob?
Jake, I mean, come on --
Leave him. Someone's going to find him eventually. Then they'll start looking for us, too.
Tonight. Just me.
We pay better.
No, not "whatever." You're either in or you're out.
So then Miles walks straight into the Creative Director's office and says "The code's fine, the program's for shit" and throws down like a thousand pages of code on the guy's desk!
Calls?
That's it.
What? No. Use the bathroom on the plane!
Why not?
Was that a threat? Did I hear a threat? Last I remember, we were talking economics, then this...? What happens next time if we gotta stop and help a little old lady cross the street? Well, shit... Then we gotta pass the call to someone else.
Gunther? I think I'd remember a Gunther.
Hey, I got it! Take some mental notes. You just might learn something here.
Honey, this is Mr. Lewis. Carolyn Lewis's father. Mr. Lewis, this is my wife, Lily.
Intuition.
WHAT?
You sold me out. You should have trusted me like I trusted you. You fucked up. You fucked up HUGE.
Just mail it to the hospital.  Mr. King, please. It's regarding an accounting problem. Yes... Correct... I know where it is. That will be fine. Thank you.
Breasts.
I'm just thinking out loud here, but... Two million in a briefcase?
Yeah, or D, it's a dumb fucking idea...
We never had a problem with that before.
Michelle Strigo. Loan officer.
There is no scam! I've got a fucking sign on my back! I can't leave town now and come back with a suitcase full of money. You get it? It's over. We walk.
Point, Lupus. Give us a point.
Sorry. What?
You were right. He's trying to fuck you. You want it, you gotta get it at the airport...
I can handle it.
I don't doubt your talent. You looking for that place in the hall of fame?
I want to get out from under all this for good. And I want to fuck them all doing it.
Consider him part of your crew. Consider him a part of me.
That's it?
Jack Manfred.
You called the casino a cesspit.
A couple I know are getting married.
Is that your idea of arithmetic?
I'm not a mathematician. I'm in business.
Did she?  You were pretty thick at one time.
Looking forward!
Hey. I've got an idea. Why don't we...
Get what?  Are you accusing me of cheating?
Not particularly.
You mean I won't resist them.
It's not just inner beauty, is it?
I've got a job.
What job?
I don't know.
It's only hair. I haven't changed.
This fucking job's getting to you. You haven't written a fucking word since you started.
Do you have to swear all the time?
What do I mean to you? I want to know. Tell me.
He was a loser. This guy's a croupier. He can't lose. People have shat on him all his life. Now he's in control. He's a winner.
You will?
Give up being a croupier, Jack. Or I'll shop you. All you have to do is keep your word. It's that simple.
I won't.  Goodbye, dad.
You know what? I'd like to buy you a drink.
And superstitious too. It's like witchcraft.
Absolutely not. But then, I'm a Gemini and Geminis don't believe in astrology.
Remember the guy who cheated at the table?
It can only work with amateurs, A pro would have spotted it.
I didn't.
Then you're not a pro.
Who's they?
Robbery's not criminal?
You keep the ten thousand pounds.
I'm asking you, as a...friend. You'd be saving the life of a friend.
I told you, all bets are off.
Thank you.
Bruise?  Oh, yes. It's better.
Who...
I know a cheat when I see one. The man was a cheat.
Have I?
Nice car.
I'll lay you five to one you won't sleep. In this job you have to unwind. Otherwise it'll kill you. I mean that.
I don't cheat, Jack. You've got it wrong.
Just girls. What are you drinking?
Don't worry, I won't report you!
We check every four days.
We have tapes in here that go back six months. Let me show you something.
Fine.
What flickering light?
Yeah.
Yoo hoo, bomb...
All right, then...
Bomb #20 to Sergeant Pinback. Roger, I read you, continue.
Huh?
False data can act only as a distraction. Therefore. I shall refuse to perceive you.
Hey, bomb.
And I saw that I was alone.
I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes thirty seconds. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
I have no proof that it was false data.
Another unknown. Not on the charts. A red dwarf.
Yeah. Eight, it says here.
Who cares. Don't bother me.
Wha?
-- automatic channels open --
5-4-3-2-1-drop, drop, drop!
Okay, Doolittle, I'll have it in a minute.
I'm getting something here, on this readout...
The waves at Malibu and Zuma were fantastic in the springs Talby. I can remember running out on the beach early spring mornings with my board and a wet suit...
Sh, Talby, don't bother me now.
Before we get too far away, and our signals start to fade, I just wanted to tell you... you were my favorite. I really liked you, Doolittle.
Commander, sir, we have a big problem. You see, the Veil Nebula bomb, Bomb Number 20, is stuck. It won't drop from the bomb bay. It refuses to listen and plans to detonate in --  -- less than eleven minutes.
Ah... pity, pity...
That's correct, sir.
What should we do, sir? The time is running out.
Ah... it seems to me, Doolittle... Sorry, I've drawn a blank. Hold it. I'll have it again in a minute. I forget so many things in here, so many things. Hold on, just a minute, let me think...
Yeah, the skipper always was lucky.
Oh, yeah?
No?
That's not why we're here.
You're not still pissed?
Justine was not an unwilling participant.
Same old story.  Not interested.
I'll give you seventy-five bucks for it.
Yech...
And for all his cattin' around, not much of a stick man either.
You didn't...
They took my daughter.
We didn't get a chance to finish our conversation the other night.
Look around at all this...  Built by people who got up every morning and worked hard trying to make a better life.  Then the bomb happened and everyone got scared.  They blinked and before they knew it they'd given away the store to a bunch of thugs who were happy to take it off their hands.  Overnight the government, the police, everything intended to protect the people had been turned against them.
You miss the good ol' days.  Even though there were still poor people who died from diseases when they didn't have to. And rich people spent obscene amounts of money redecorating their houses to match the cat.  Those good ol' days?
Yeah...
I won't be staying.
It was open.
Am I s'posed to be grateful?
That would be appropriate, yes.
C'mon, Max.  First I watch you dive headfirst out the window fifteen stories up like you're Rocky the flying squirrel. Then, I found this in your apartment.
I remember fine.  I just didn't understand what was going on.  They never told us anything except what to do.  It took me a long time afterwards to figure things out.
Your basic hodge-podge.
I didn't make it this far by attracting a lot of attention.
They want me...bad.  Or at least they don't want me grabbed up by the Chinese or whoever.  Best case, I wind up back in that facility.  More likely, it's a long drive out in the country, if you know what I mean.
On accounta you, Sonrisa didn't get to buy off the jury, or kill the judge. He's gone.  Once and for all.  It was war, Max, and you won.
Open it.
You don't want to.
Can't help you.
My name's Lydia.  And it seems you and I have a lot in common.
You said you knew where my fiance was the other night.
He got the car in a trade for his old pick-up and some food...no bill of sale or nothing.  It was right after the pulse so all the DMV records were wiped.  So we don't get anything on the seller.  Except I actually managed to find this guy, six hours on the phone... Say thank you.
They don't exactly have a search engine for finding a bunch of kids with bar- codes on their necks, which is something I'm not even going to ask about--
Here's your money.
Bastard...
Sure you wanna be havin' this conversation over the phone?
You're way more philosophical than I could ever be.
They don't have a lot of moving parts.
Only one I can think of.
But, of course, there's nothing self- serving in that scenario.
Not right now?  Okay, when?
Only way you're ever gonna find out is reincarnation... Fact is, you are gonna pay me, and I am gonna provide you with a service.
What if he's on the level?
We gotta talk.
Do guys actually believe their lame, self- serving excuses?
Max--
Lame, self-serving, arrogant...guilty as charged.
You left out condescending.
I'm a toy to her.
Who either doesn't care, or could have me killed.  Either way, Natalie's still gonna find out.
--a philandering pig.
Or, I dissolve into an angry, hysterical wreck who never wants to see your lying ass again, which is probably what would really happen.
I just don't want Natalie to ever find out.  She deserves better.
I'll give it my best shot.
No, I'm serious.  That psycho got exactly what she deserved... Yes.
She was the one--
For a change.
How 'bout you don't break my sneakers on this.  The guy is seriously not well.
Well, shame on him if he doesn't.
Hawk.
Got any KISS?
I don't care. I wanna hear more.
I have all your notebook doodles memorized, Jam... Here.
Whatever... stella.
Oh, I'll remember it till the day I die. His name was... Simpleton the Simian? No, Samson Samoan... No, simply, similar...
Check!
Never mind with the too bad shit. I got a crazy plan, but only the craziest among us can pull it off.
So? Your mom's car has a CB, radar detector and cruise control, check?
And when is she due back from that groinecologist's convention anyway?
Sunday, but...
No, I'm dumber than a goddamn slug. Now can I please clean your windshield and leave without further ado?
Sure.
Hawk?
They're what?
Please, Jam, we're trying to vent some hostility here. Sure the whole thing may be your fault, but who's gonna get pissed off at you?
We all beat each other up, then, once we're nice and bruised, we run over to the ticket takers and say we got mugged and our tickets were stolen. They gotta let us in then.
Just keep your lying, heathenous trap shut, Jeremiah.
Okay... when she peeled off that gown, you'll never guess what she was wearing underneath.
Shrooms! And even if it was LSD, I can still give my mom a kiss without smelling the catch of the day.
What?
Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! Maybe we can glue the tickets back together!
We won?!
Damn, she musta hot wired it. We picked up a professional car thief in the shape of Olivia Newton-John!
A likely story. Hand it over, kid.
A tag on your toe. Nobody threatens me and lives.
Trip? You just got yourself four tickets and four backstage passes to KISS live at Cobo Hall tonight!
Good morning...
Like a spear.
Could these wormholes appear in nature?
When you fall asleep tonight, I'm gonna fart in your face.
You know what? I think that you did it.
Do you believe in time travel, Donnie?
I don't wanna talk about it.
No... I mean, will you GO with me? That's like... what they call it here. Going together.
And what?
Are you okay?
She wrote it.  There are chapters in this book that describe the stuff I've been seeing. It can't just be a coincidence.  Will you come see her with me?
Maybe she's asleep.
Hey. You OK?
Yeah, they told me to get out of the house.
It was great. We had peanut-butter sandwiches and apples and honey at snacktime. And then during show-and- tell, my stuffed walrus was a big hit.
You tell Dr. Thurman whatever you want.
Why should we care?
How so?
I don't own a television.
So, tell me about your day, Donald.
Gretchen. We're going together now.
Is Callie still around?
It was just like she described them in her book. Like they were alive. The way that they looked... moved... smelled. They were like workers... assigned to each one of us.  I followed my spear... and I found something...
Have you told Gretchen about the spears?
Do you wish that you were punished by your parents instead?
Hungry Hungry Hippos.
You've done it again?
Yes. I flooded my school... and I burned down that pervert's house. I think I only have a few days left... before they catch me.
Maybe you'd like to tell Mom and Dad why you stopped taking your medication.
Well, don't worry... I'm taking my medication.
That's a nice name.  OK, let me see it.
Excuse me? What's your name, son?
That's enough.
You can suck a fuck.
How did you know --
Yes, I saw the news. Something about a kiddie-porn dungeon.
Oh, Kitty, I don't know. This is so last-minute... Eddie is in New York...
No more fuckin' for her.
Smurfette doesn't fuck.
I stole four beers from my dad.
I heard you, I was just tryin' to scare you into changin' your mind. Oh for Chrissakes, Amber, the woman clung to your tap shoes while flyin' through the air like a Goddamn lawn dart!
Airport Ho-Jo!
Oh c'mon, I love 'em, but you know they only had me 'cause Peter needed a kidney.
Ruined a brand-new pair of Lee Press- ons.  Well, I sat down for a beer and KA- BLEWEY! Next thing I know, somethin' blows through my kitchen window. Next thing I know, I'm ass up in Loretta's flower bed.
What?!
It's okay.
Sorry. I -- I don't make the rules.
Oh, Amber, like you're the only one who visits Mary.
And the bite marks on my ears?
Y'know, if you have, you got all the pictures of the winner you need.
Oh, Christ, it's true.
Why don't you paint a big red target on your ass, Loretta.
I'll be right back. See ya later.
All right, they're makin' a movie.
That's right.
Okay?
That bitch from...
Wisconsin.
Sammy Davis, Jr., honey.
Yeah, yeah, the Jew.
Becky was my only shot at state!
That's why we Lutherans use grape Koolaid for the blood of Christ.
"Proud... to be... an... American."
I want to get the big bag of little donuts.
Gloria, much as I hate to leave, I'd be crazy to stay here.
I no gotta new-rosis.  My uncle he's- a got a flower shop -- he's-a gotta new-rosis.
Well - what is he now?
What do you whistle?
I don't want him.
He only weighs ten ounces --
You don't want to be a public nuisance, do you?
You wouldn't consider going over Niagara Falls without a barrel?
Did you shoot the rapids?
I don't know what's keeping me.  I should've been here a long time ago. Now how about my proposition?
That's no good.  I like to work on the outside.  I must have something easy.
Then you don't wanna work hard?
Sure, that's easy.  You gotta insult somebody.
He's-a very easy to insult --  I say something to his niece once, and he slapped my face.
Why didn't his niece slap your face?
That's not bad for any day.
I don't know about us, but I know he's-a got something...
That's not fair -- we've only got fifty thousand.
No. Seventy-five -- seventy-five.
I wish you were still working for me, so I could ask you to resign. How're ya fixed for cavalry?
All right -- I'll go out and find one.
The husband steps outside; Relinquishes his bride; We stand him up against the wall And take him for a ride. 
I'll tell you what I'll do.  I'll give you Mrs. Teasdale as security.  or my jackknife.  If you want my advice, you'll take the jackknife... I've a better proposition...  Make it $25 and I'll give you a first mortgage on my son and I hope you foreclose.
You swine!
You upstart!
THEN IT'S WAR!
I haven't been on the job five minutes and already she's making advances to me.  Not that I care -- but where is your husband?
If it's not asking too much --  For our information just for illustration  Tell us how you intend to run the nation.
I wouldn't know what to say either if I was in your place.  Maybe you can suggest something.
Why -- why -- of course.
Don't bother me - I'm thinking -- What was that?
Gloria -- I've waited for years.  I won't be put off!  I love you!  I want you!  Can't you see that I'm at your feet?
I didn't come here to be insulted.
This is terrible!
I thought everything was working out fine.
Yes please, two.
How lovely.
No, I think a whiskey.
Do you?
And here are my mother and father.
That I am very little different from him.
Oh that's absurd, Frederick. No, no Frederick, that's all wrong! John is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life. And, that is completely due to you.
He's sick, Bytes. He's going to die.
I intend to.
He fell.  He falls.
That's the way he sleeps. If he lays down, he'll die.  Head's too heavy.
Never mind that, I want my man!
Pull the other one, why don't you! We made a deal!
I've got my rights, damn you, and I'm going to the authorities!
It's quite nutritious, sir.
Mr. Treves, it's out of the question. I want to hear as soon as possible what the other hospitals can do. I'm sorry.
Yes, I'm very sorry to have wasted your time, sir. I just felt that I had to do anything I could to protect him.
Steady on, Treves. Have a seat.
Are you comfortable here?
Mmmm. Hodges, Pierce come closer. Mr. Hill, take hold of the rope please. It's a machine accident. I expect you'll be seeing a good deal of this.
I don't know what I've got.
An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.
O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de tramperies.
Oh no... no... you're a Romeo.
I fear not, Mrs. Kendal. Even in the short time he was gone the size of his head has increased rapidly... as is his pain.
Yes.
Want to come out?
Very good! Oh yes! Now listen. I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to repeat them... um... I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand? I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand?
Very good, very good. Now, when your visitor comes today I want you to say it exactly the way you said it just now. I will introduce him to you and you will say the words you've learned. If you have any trouble with any of the words, I'll help you. I'm sure you'll be just fine. If you do as well for him as you've done for me these last two days, then I'm sure our visitor will be very pleased. Now, let's go through the whole thing again, shall we? I will say "May I introduce you to Mr. Carr Gomm." And you will say...
But the variety of food here is very pleasing... I commend you.
You did not ask me.
Very well, thank you. I have something for you, John. I'm sure you'll enjoy it, it's very popular.
Of course! What did you think?
Not at all, John.
Yes, John.
You did this for me?
John.... how can you ever forgive me?
I'm glad, John. Goodnight.
I've heard.
Perhaps you've got the time for that, Mr. Treves, I certainly don't. I've got an entire hospital to look after, and you have your real patients. Don't waste your time with him sir, it's like talking to a wall. I don't mean to be harsh, but truthfully what can you do for him? I'll be back later for his bath. And Mr. Carr Gomm would like to see you when you have a moment. Good day sir.
Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter put them in my office.
Yes sir.  What's that?
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME! I ain't done nothing wrong. People pay to see your monster, Mr. Treves. I just take the money.
I don't think so. No sir, we're closed.
Ah! It's my father!
There's nobody here, Father. Look for yourself.
I said welcome.
You're as bad as my father.
No. It's YOU who doesn't understand, Aud. Halfdan has come to kill and destroy. We brought him here. We must stop him.
I MUST look! Keitel! Hold this!
Of course.
You don't have to love me. Just: do you believe I love YOU?
They will make fun of you for listening to an old woman's stories?
Of course not... but... when I was a child... I remember a dream.... it was as if the whole sky was blue...
The Gods decreed that if ever a sword spills human blood upon these shores, the whole of Hy-Brasil will sink beneath the waves.
But you don't want to hear it.
Right! Summon the musicians! We'll do the one that goes "TUM-TUM-TUM- TUM-TI-TUM-TUM"
About NOT raping you...
But that's a circular argument! If the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition, they cancel each other out.
Oh! Stop talking as if we were married!
I just said I didn't feel like raping you.
And I was just saying that rape is no MORE pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on.
I didn't mean to!
I know!
Where does it all get us, Grandpa?
I met this girl...
Bring the Age of Ragnarok to an end and stop all this fighting and bloodshed.
Now you've got all the ones with beards on one side and all the moustaches on the other.
Oh... er... yes...
Keitel Blacksmith?
What is it?
The Dragon...
Do what?
Same thing, isn't it?
I've got you, Keitel Blacksmith. If you go... I go too...
It's me. I'm just going to water the dragon... 
Oh, I couldn't do that! The Blacksmith's Code says...
Yes yes... of course.... the "Blacksmith's Code"...
Well... I... I thought...
Dad!
No... he's not... not... there...
Yes, Mum.
This is the night you met Clementine, Joel. I remember watching you walk down the beach with her and I thought, oh shit.
I told you that later.
In the room?
I'm excited, too. Oh, and I wanted to give you this. It's a little... thing.
It's gorgeous.  Just my taste. I've never  gone out with a guy who brought me a piece of jewelry I liked.  Thanks. So let's get going. Long drive.
Rockville Center.
Ah, the hair.  Blue, right? It's called Blue Ruin. The color. Snappy name, huh?
I don't really know how --
You sure? That doesn't sound --
Yeah, I got it.
No jokes about my name? Oh, you wouldn't do that; you're trying to be nice.
Shit. Shit. I know it's here. Hold on.
You're not a stalker or anything, right?
Remember? "And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And I'm lost in the window/I hide on the stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your hat..."  Oh, shit. I'm so stupid. Sorry.
Hey, do you want to have a drink? I have lots of drinks. And I could --
You just say. I'm not really --
I don't know.
I don't either. I used to. But I'm through with that. Y'know, if I don't love my body, then I'm just lost. You know? With all the wrinkles and scars and the general falling apart that's coming 'round the bend.  So, I've been seeing this guy...
That made me cry. But, anyway, we went up to Boston, because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River. It gets frozen this time of year.
It's three.
I don't think we're ready.
Joel, We're fucking gonna talk about it!
Joel, you're a liar.
There's this guy. I heard him talking in my apartment. He's one of the eraser guys. And he fell for you when they were erasing you, so he introduced himself the next day as if he were a stranger and now you're dating him.
I don't like it either, but I'm just trying to find horrible secret place to --
Yeah.
No! I think you were wearing that black dress, y'know, with the buttons.
Yes, exactly. Exactly my point.
Sorry to track you down like this. I'm not a stalker. But I needed to see you.
I don't think I've slept in a year.
Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?
I'm sorry. I just wanted to say that. This seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and --
-- and I'm just too nervous around you right now.
Says you were constantly calling me a slob.  It's sexy that we were like a married couple, griping and overly-familiar and bored. Don't you think?
Tomorrow night... honeymoon on ice.
I don't know. Panties and --
Hi.
Is that like us? Are we just bored with each other?
Is there any sort of risk of brain damage?
We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about your relationship with Clementine.
You have to stop this!
I'm trapped in my head and everything I love is being erased! Stop it now!
The thing is, Joel, whatever it is you think you have with this chick, once the thrill wears off, you're just going to be Joel with the same fucking problems.
I'm sorry.
We'll speak soon.
Sorry. I just --
I know. Anyway --
Yup.
Listen, it's not erasing.
Hell no.
I never saw you together like that again. So I figured I was imagining things.
What do you want, Stan?
Remember the Alamo! Remember the Alamo!
Mary... please. This is hurting people.
Yes?
Yeah, yeah it is, Howard. And here I was thinking I could tell you something you didn't know.
We... have a history. I'm sorry. You wanted the procedure. You wanted it done... to get past. I have to finish in there. It's almost morning. We'll talk later.
Oh dear.
That's fine, Stan.
I think he's in a conference. Unfortunately. I'm really sorry.
Okay, There's more, Stan --
Save your breath for the climb.
Clockworks.
Clockworks?
He was a degenerated warlock who could turn urine into beer, and the honor that he extended me gave me rights of occupancy in this sacred cave on this far-away Siwash Ridge. I came to the Dakota hills to construct a clockworks of my own.
I know, but where do you reside when you aren't visiting New York?
Well, no, I don't reside anywhere in particular. I just keep moving.
Cowgirls exist as an image. A fairly common image. The idea of cowgirls especially for little girls prevails in our culture. Therefore, it seems to me, the existence of cowgirls should prevail. Otherwise, they're being fooled. In the Rodeo Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City there are just two cowgirls. Two. And both of 'em are trick-riders. Trick-riding is what cowgirls have almost always done in rodeos. Our society sure likes to see its unconventional women do tricks. That's what prostitutes call it, you know: 'tricking.'
'Drugged' is a stupid word.
Whose fault was that?
But I don't want you to leave. Please stay. We can go to dinner. I owe you a dinner. And tonight... we can... really make love.
Tired...
Shit O goodness, you won't be thirty for another year, and you're more beautiful than ever.
Does that mean you might have an assignment for me?
A job for me?
Purely personal. I believe you might enjoy one another.
You're convinced the crew could still be alive? After seven years?
Hold on, Coop...
On my way.
Will it work?
We're still venting trace gasses, gimme twenty minutes to plug the hole.
Trauma.
His vitals are stable, but he's unresponsive to stimuli. He might wake up in fifteen minutes. He might not wake up at all.
It sounds like "ex infera:" "ex," from; "infera," the ablative case of "inferi." "Hell."
No. I don't believe in that sort of thing.  But if Dr. Weir is right, this ship has passed beyond the boundaries of our universe, of reality. Who knows where this ship has been... What it's seen...  And what it's brought back with it.
Pressure?
Don't thank me, Bill. I'm not doing you any favors.
The official inquiry blamed Weir's design for the ship's loss.
That's the Second Containment Seal. Beyond that, engineering.
Yeah. I'm -- I'm okay.
Smith, use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster.
-- once we've secured the ship, that's the way it is!  I need you to guide us from the comm station. This is where I need you. Help us to do our job.
They're empty, Dr. Weir. Moving forward.
If it worked.
The date.
What do you want me to say?
To what? Where did this ship go? Where did you send it?
Where has it been for the past seven years?
You're insane. You've lost your mind.
Watch me.
Son of a bitch!
I don't need them anymore. Where we're going, we won't need eyes to see.
I'm here, Smith, how's the Clark?
That's enough!
What is it, Smith?
There's not enough radiation to throw off the scan. I'm picking up trace life forms, but I can't get a lock on the location.
Okay. Let's find out how much time we just bought.
It's building up with every breath we take. And the CO2 filters on the Event Horizon are shot.
Who?
I thought you wanted an answer. And that's the only one I have.
Justin's in the airlock.
We blow the Corridor. Use the foredecks as a lifeboat, separate it from the rest of the ship. We stay put...
He's dead...
Do you know what it was?
Say this paper represents space-time, and you want to get from "point A" here...  ...to "point B," here.  Now: what's the shortest distance between two points?
She's not ugly.
All boards are green, everything's five by five.
Matching speed... now. Range to target ten thousand meters and closing... Skipper, I got a bad feeling about this...
Get them back --
If they were in stasis, I'd get a location, but these readings, they're all over the ship. It doesn't make any sense.
No, there's no evidence of a surge or spike of any kind. It's as if time just... stopped for seven years.
The forward airlock.
Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
My step-dad's. I'm strictly into stone. I was wondering when you'd walk by.
I like the sound of that.
I mean...
Tell me. When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know?  You went your own way then. You didn't listen to people. So why start now...?
No, it's not. I thought I was done waiting for Reed... We're all in this together now, Ben.
Victor must've taken him.
Don't come any closer for a sec. This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
We got what we wanted. That's enough.
I know, I know. I'm just worried about what he wants... Speaking of which...
Youthful high spirits.
Solid.
This isn't permanent, Johnny. We need to be careful until we're normal again.
Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible. The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben. You had the best --
Really? With a name like Von Doom? Never saw that one coming.
Not this again --
What? No. I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
Now.
That's the temperature of the sun.
No, I'm sorry, for pushing you out.
Yes sir. You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
It's been changed.
I just wanted to share an apartment. What was so complicated about that?
He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
Reed. Shh. Just be quiet. And look up.
Why didn't you say something?
I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
Oh, I think you already have.
Brad. I don't want to have to use sex as a tool.
Totally.
It's the first door on your left.
You really want me to put all this stuff back on?
Well, that's not the way it works, really. And you ate most of your food already, too...
They're not home yet.
I'd say... who the hell is Ron Johnson?
Are you kidding? Work is great. I kill at work. I don't even mind Mom and Dad making me pay rent.
Why? Because she won't sleep with you?
But your face did!
No.
Yes, sir.
You're fired.
Get a ride with somebody.
What? Are you all right?
I'm in a hurry too. I just thought I could say hi to you.
Of course something happens. You put the vibe out to thirty million chicks, you know something's gonna happen.
That's the idea, Rat. That's The Attitude.
All right. Pay attention.
You wuss. It's no problem. One person says something to the other and that's how it starts...
Damone! You come here?
Okay. See ya.
No Damone. I don't understand.
So what makes you so sensitive?
It's a way, Damone. It's a vibe. I put it out, and I have personally found that girls do respond.
Okay. Thanks a lot, Linda.
Outrageous, Merv. Nice to be here. I feel great.
I've been swimming, Merv.
I like sex.
They're fuckin' with us.
You know the thing I love about Mustangs? The steering wheel.
Make up your mind. Is he gonna shit, or is he gonna kill us?
What variables?
It was nice.
What's Doug do in Chicago?
He works for the airline. He'll be out here. You'll meet him.
I paid for it and everything.
Don't do anything, Linda. I'd rather just forget about it. I don't even like the guy.
Yeah, like maybe never.
I don't know, mon. The food lines took forever.
Fine. You sit right here on your bed. I'll use the chair here.  As I explained to your parents just a moment ago, and to you many times since the very beginning of the school year -- I don't like to spend my time waiting for late students, or detention cases. I'd rather be preparing the lesson.
Hey, it's in my locker, Mr. Hand.
What's that?
All right! Oh, yeah!
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
What about those other guys you live with?
You keep them.
We keep them, in case the people come back.
Yeah. She is pretty good.
I think I'll have the Seafood Salad Special.
Excellent.
Not at all.
No, they're away for the weekend. Brad and I are watching the house.
Well... it's getting kind of late.
Hi, Stacy. How are you?
Two Cokes.
Tell me. When will the doctor be awake?
Not for me.
Or just think it? Was I talking? Did they hear me?
The medicine? Yes, it's right here.
The truth is we're going to Vegas to croak a scag baron named Savage Henry. I've known him for years but he ripped us off -- and you know what that means, right?
No, no. Don't leave me!
Why what?
What do you expect? I'm your attorney. You owe me five bucks. I want it now.
Don't go near that elevator. That's just what they want us to do... trap us in a steel box and take us down to the basement.
Look you better put that blade away and get your head straight. I have to put the car in the lot.
BULLSHIT! Don't make me use this.
Jesus.
Who said anything about slicing you up? I just wanted to carve a little Z on your forehead. Nothing serious.
You're supposed to be in Vegas. We have a suite at the Flamingo. I was just about to leave for the airport.
Well... It'll probably work out. We can keep her loaded and peddle her ass at the drug convention.
I figure she can do about four at a time. Christ, if we keep her full of acid that's more like two grand a day. Maybe three.
They're actually nice people when you get to know them.
She really flipped over you. The only way I could get rid of her was by saying you were taking me out to the desert for a showdown -- that you wanted me out of the way so you could have her all to yourself.  I guess she figures you won. That phone message wasn't for me, was it?
Extract of pineal!
I think we should put her on the payroll. See what she comes up with.
Do you think you can handle it?
Two glasses of ice water with ice.
I know you're cops, but I thought you were just here for that convention. I swear! All I wanted to do was clean up the room. I don't know anything about dope!
No! I swear I'm not!
That's a strange attitude.
Not my jurisdiction. The city limits are two point two miles beyond the rest area. Can you make it that far?
Bullshit! You're just as much a part of it as they are!
You and a lot of other people.
Don't be stupid, drop the gun!
I don't wanna go home alone... I don't wanna see what might have...
But it's got teeth.
Hey. You noticed that no one's been killed or maimed for awhile?
Unfortunately, the worst of 'em are still outside.
Well, justice is funny.
What's it for?
This is it! This is our only way out! They have this place surrounded. We go out the front, we're dead. We go out the back, we're dead, but if we go UNDER them... we might just make it.  Now, who else is in? Seven can go.
Just move!
Believe me, I'd love to save the day and get some heroic snatch. But it's not in the cards, partner.
My truck.
Anybody else?
What?
But --
It's much safer in there, sweety.
What?
Huh?
The boards are solid oak planks, and the floor is reinforced by a steel grid beneath. Nothing real or supernatural is busting through this, least nothing the size of the beasts.
Fully.
Four door?
Max?
Keys.
HOLD THAT TIGHT!
Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?
Done. But you're locked in.  Will you hold the keys?
REPEAT. WE NEED HELP. SOS. CALLING ALL CARS! WE NEED HELP AT THE UNITED NATIONS TAV--!
That's fine.
Make a distraction out front and go for it out the back. There's cars back there, right?
I'll do anything to help.
I think --
You know that no one likes a liar, right?
I'm sure it wasn't me, it wasn't me...
Excuse me, sir?
Very fine bone structure.
But I'm the one up there on the screen.
Uh-huh. You mean what if the public finds out I perspire? And wear slacks. And drive an old jalopy? What if they find out I'm a real person. Oh no! Say it ain't so! Not a real person!
That's right. I don't want them breathing down my neck while we're in London.
Who?
Yes. That's the deal. She plays Lorna.
What night?
The hearing's tomorrow. If she gets out legally, they can't come after her.
Look at her! She'll never pass that sanity test tomorrow...
I gotta go now.
Listen to yourself, Frances. The resistance, the anger in your voice.
...I see.
Yes, yes, it's all arranged. Everyone's collecting subscriptions in your name. And the best part is: the trip returns you to New York.
And you think it's worth all this?
Be careful, Francie.
I pity us, Dad. I pity us both.
Fifteen.
Why... yes.
What is this?
Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I look like a newshound to you?
Oh yeah! I saw you in the newsreel!
You know, my Dad's done some work for Kaminski...
I don't know... I did... feel different... Alive.
Quietly.
What happened to him?
I don't know, Harry. I... I want so many...
Since when do you believe the papers? They killed him, kid.
Oh no...
Eight stories.
Is that why you did it?
If they say they love it, they'll probably love it. Not everybody lies, you know?
The chauffeur. He's watching.
Help yourself. Everyone else has.
Well, I would have, you know? I just didn't know how to cook it.
I don't know. It hurts, Harry. Some things, no matter what you do with them, they just hurt.
Forget it, Frances. You're not driving.
...Take advantage of me.
To quarter-horses.
You should stickaround sometimes. Look out for me.
Will you marry me?
Frances, You're crazy.
Right. Except... time has a way of --
Oh, you...  ...ennh.
I'm not sure.
No, we're not.
Well, I was picking fruit with some migrant workers until...
You know, I've never been able to figure that out.
Miss Farmer, is it true you fought with the policeman who arrested you last night?
Fine!
What?
But I want to. I'm trying!
You think I got it?
Yes, Ma.
I don't care.
Well, they needed immediate answers, Frances. It's good manners and good sense. You shouldn't be bothering yourself with these right now.
Sure.
You... you selfish, selfish child. At least talk to him, hear what he has to say.
No. No, it all depends on what offers I get.
But what -- 
Don't I know you?
I don't believe so.
So it seems. May we be serious for a moment?
This whole thing is a joke!
Stay calm, please.
Frances, you're still filled with anxiety. You feel guilty and hostile toward your family and friends. Consequently, I didn't recommend your release at the staff review.
'Incurable.'
What is that to you? Evil as you are.
Then why weep for him?
Friends? Do they live around here?
Yes, I speak. And read. And think... and know the ways of Man.  I've been waiting for you. Two months now.
A companion. A female. Like me, so she won't hate me.
I do know that for the sympathy of one living being, I would make peace with all.  I have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine. And rage the likes of which you would not believe. If I cannot satisfy the one, I will demonically indulge the other. That choice is yours.  You're the one who set this in motion, Frankenstein.
So have I
Fine.
To be the best there ever was. To push our knowledge beyond our dreams... to eradicate disease and pestilence... to purge mankind of ignorance and fear...
I give you my soul...
I have been waiting for this ever since.
This ice will break yet.  How's our guest?
No. But someday.
Very well then.
Of course I am. It pays to humor the insane.
Can you think of a better reason?
I resent God's monopoly.
There are sick people who need our help. Here and now. Not in some future time. Consider that.
Listen to what I'm saying. The militia's arriving to quarantine the city. Most of us are getting out while we still can.
A... week?
Nothing in moderation, Frankenstein.
Victor. This place looked like a charnel house. What went on here?
Yes, don't worry. I'll look after your father. You look after her.
Krempe has a way of provoking my temper.
Oh, now you have gone too far. There's only one God, Victor.
I'm... dying.
Ah. An explorer.
You'd persist at the cost of your own life? The lives of your crew?
Give them a little while longer. It's still early, anyway.
Oh, thanks. I wish I could spend more time at it.
I don't know. Probably be best for everybody.
Everybody except the girl who's supposed to handle the kitchen. Annie.
It's over twenty miles to the crossroads. Steve'll be back in an hour. Things will straighten out then. We'll take his Jeep and get help.
I had to.
God, but I love that sexy talk.
Good call.
Gotta pee. You're lying on my bladder.
Okay, Fireman.
Aw.
How much do I owe you?
No, but I passed by it a couple of times. It's out in the middle of nowhere. It seems like a rowdy place, so there wouldn't be a lot of police. And it's open from dusk till dawn. You said meet you in the morning.
Vamanos!
The truth hurts.
Lie in the back, Dad, I'll drive us into Mexico.
If they get over the border, they're gonna let us go.
It's not suicide if you're already dead. Two...
Jacob.
He's my son.
How does that happen? You don't look Japanese.
Not quite. She was trapped in the wreck for about six hours before she passed on.
Real McCoy.
How do I know you'll keep your word?
You want me to sit here and be passive. The only way being passive in this situation makes sense is if I believe you'll let us go. I'm not there yet. You have to convince me you're telling the truth.
Didn't think so. So, as I was saying, I'm willing to make a deal. You behave, get us into Mexico, and don't try to escape. I'll keep my brother off your daughter and let you all loose in the morning.
As long as you're cool, she'll be cool. What're ya gonna say?
Yeah, I know what's going on. We got a bunch of fuckin' vampires outside trying to get inside and suck our fuckin' blood! That's it, plain and simple. And I don't wanna hear any bullshit about "I don't believe in vampires" because I don't fuckin' believe in vampires either. But I do believe in my own two fuckin' eyes, and with my two eyes I saw fuckin' vampires! Now, does everybody agree we're dealin' with vampires.
Good for you. Now, since we all believe we're dealing with vampires, what do we know about vampires? Crosses hurt vampires. Do you have a cross?
My guess is that this little dive's been feeding on nomad road waifs like bikers and truckers for a longtime. This is probably some of the shipments they stole off the trucks.
Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it!
I'm really sorry.
Bullshit! You hate us. If you had half a chance you'd feed us to them!
Noooo!
Not many.
-- see this, television!
Agent Chase, does it appear that they are heading for Mexico.
Is it safe to assume that because the death count involved and the loss of life of law enforcement officers, that the Bureau, the Rangers and the police force are taking this manhunt personally?
Haven't felt it a bit. Been inside with the air conditioner blastin' all day long.
What? Are you kidding? I didn't do anything!
What dya mean?
This is a private club. You're not welcome.
Seth, he did it. You were by the beer cooler with your back turned. I was by the magazines, I could see his face.  And I saw him mouth:
Do they have a waterbed?
These guys ain't spic firecracker salesman from Tijuana. They don't even know the meaning of the word "barter".  You wanna stay in El Ray? You give them thirty percent of your loot. It's scripture. So it is written, so shall it be done. You want sanctuary, you pay the price, and the price is thirty percent.
Sight seein'.
It's not your fault, it's her fault!
Seth, if you were me --
Take a pill, kid. I just meant stay cool.
Yeah, I think so. What happened?
Really?
We are...  "South of the border down Mexico way."
They broke when you fell.
Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!
Okay, I'll have one.
Go out and bring it in. I feel a song coming on.
Thank you, ensign.
Can I ask you somethin', lieutenant? How come you're doing this?  I mean, we're kinda curious.
More than you'd guess.  It's just that we don't hold coffee klatches. If more then three of us get together at any one time, the guys think it's some kind of uprising.
-- and now I got reporters from Toadsquat, Iowa, calling my office and askin' what I know about this "G.I. Jane" thing.
-- nothing I can do about it unless you're suggesting I infringe on their civil liberties -- which I'd happily do if you'll just trim a little fat off the Constitution.
Jordan, dear.  How are they treating you?
Thank you, sir.
No, sir.
Straight up?
I'm not sure what --
Smoke her.
Jordan.  Might we do this over lunch tomorrow?  I do very much want to talk, but now is scarcely --
No, ma'am.
I'll work on it, ma'am.
Flea, 'Cool, Cortez, Newman -- take your minis, hit the water.  Go, GO!
She's a women, and that's why you're ridin' her bareback.
You'll try what we tell you to try, O'Neil.  Go regulation.
I believe he earned it for saving a man's life in Saudi Arabia.  He wanted you to have it.  He was very clear on that point.
The Chief was granted early retirement as of 17-hundred yesterday.  By 18-hundred he was gone.  Out of the Navy.
Probably hear back from CNN first.
Well, guess I don't even need to be here...
You're such a ball-breaker sometimes.  Especially at night.
Sorry.  But after our days...  So if I try this thing... if I ship out to Coronado... what happens here?
Someone screwed you over like this, left unanswered charges hanging over your head, and you're not gonna fight back?
Well, before you crawl off to die, Jordan, give me five minutes of good headwork.
Which is guy-speak for...
You are in the cage, O'Neil.  Right here, right now.
No.  Yes.  I mean, depends on --
The others already told me, O'Neil. They wanted to shoot, but you wouldn't let them.  Because you went soft on another women --
I'm not the one who got five good men thrown in a bamboo cage.  You wear the bars, you made the call, and you got your whole crew --
No.
Good to see you again, too, sir.
MOVE!
Big bites.
Great. See ya then.
What?
Lucy'd kill me if she knew.
Only one way to find out.
But we can get to the west side faster.
You're still mad at me, aren't you?
Blood sample? How close did you get to that thing?
The warm feeling of helping your fellow man.
So have dinner with me tonight.
Well, I think you're cute.
Me too.
I'll try.
Nick, my men and I will hold them here. You will have to go and get help!
Have them sealed off.
You're fast.
Get your people out of there or I will.
We're hoping you're going to help us figure that out.
What do we know? It was first sighted off the French Polynesian Pacific. An area that has been exposed to dozens of nuclear tests over the last thirty years.
What are you suggesting?
When I needed to catch earthworms, I knew the best way to catch them was not to chase them. I had to draw them out.
No, it's still in my tent. It's...oh my God, she took it.
We know.
This is America. There is nothing you can not buy.
How do I do that?
It's okay. I know her.
Thanks.
Right... Sorry, sir.
Friend. You stole all my best lines.  You cut me out of episode two entirely!..
DON'T BE INSANE, STOP! FULL STOP!
Must be some sort of mining facility.
I was staying in character.  "Egomaniacal sonofabitch?"
Sense memory. I see you got to win the fight...
Jason, what have you gotten us into?
You have a better plan, Alex?
The guy is terminally selfish!
I still haven't got this bloody thing off.
Yes, poor Jason. As we speak he's probably out somewhere talking rubbish to a roomful of hangers-on. While here I sit eating Christmas cheese in Spring.
All this from watching the.. historical records?
Could they be the miners?
He probably... Has some very important business to attend to...
You've got the utility systems walkthrough, right?
We accidently traded Vox units when we bumped into each other on Saturday.
Brandon.
It's real, Brandon. All of it, It's real.
Now make a right, you'll see a doorway that opens on the central manufacturing facility.  The bowels of the ship.
We'd never have the budget for this.
How did you come to that conclusion?
There is no weather in space.
That possibly... The valence bonds have shifted bi-laterally?
Let's get out of here before one of those things kills guy.
We're doing episode 31, Jason?
We should have a turbo. I'm always saying "activate turbo boosters", right?...
Hey, YOU want to drive?
What do you want me to say, Gwen?... They wanted the Commander.
Ninty-nine percent of ACTING is commitment. ACTING.  Stella Adler never manned a resonance cannon, she taught ACTING...
It helps.
Yeah. But I've got Gorignak staring me in the face. I think I can take it though...
We shouldn't have to DO this!  It makes NO LOGICAL SENSE! Why is it HERE?
Wait, Fred, what about your thing, you know... "Digitize me, Sergeant Chen!"
Is this really the most important thing we could be talking about right now?
Our dimwitted friends don't understand the concept of acting. They have no theater, no imagination these scientists.
We pretend...
Home.
Right. Long live... What's your planet?
I would but I am REALLY running late and the 134's a parking lot after 2:00.  But listen, the guy gives you any more trouble, just give a call...
Our former Commander was not... Strong.
Because they're coming right at us.
Well, you fought with them against the French and Iroquois, how good were they then?
Ben Franklin's going to Paris, but I think the French will be long on talk and short on guns.  Our troops are mobs, they won't take orders, have no equipment... could they beat the British?
Congress has picked up it's skirts and is racing for Baltimore. They're not waiting for spring!  Of course, they still had time to deny my promotion.  Even John Adams voted against it...
Congress is talking -- openly -- about replacing you with Lee.
It is.
Christ, George, Joseph Reed's been writing letters back to Congress attacking you.  Your own aide!
Well, truth be told?  I was a pharmacist.  Alexander?
Exactly.  We'd attack the baggage wagons and the rear guard.  It would cause the line to buckle. Then we hit the center with our main force and cut them in half.
That can't be.
Yes, William.  I am apologizing.
I ain't forgot about the freedom.
Well, general, I think I ain't got no school learning, I ain't got no trade... and I'm a drunk.  So, I think there ain't much left to be set free.
More than that, sir... my orders from Congress.
Delighted, sir.
To hell with Arnold...
George, we've got to get you out there before we lose our whole army.
They are... friends of Congress.
Again, just to touch on a touchy subject, but... would the people accept another leader over Washington?
Spies from Quebec confirm that the British are sending an entire fleet down Lake Champlain...
A ground swell-Christian movement, George, you see?
And, Hamilton?  Greene?
Are you all going insane!? Benedict Arnold!  The man who stopped the British on Lake Champlain!  Who carried the day at Saratoga!  Goddamn-it, Joseph, you own two mansions, ride in an expensive, Tory coach!  You are all nothing but a pack of greedy pigs!
What I want to know is sir:  where is your daddy?
Mon General, I have come here to learn and to give, not to take.  I am serving without salary.
Muskets and uniforms and Bayonets.
My God, these people mean to go to war!  They really mean it.
Surely you knew this was coming.
Some things must never change.
Yes, I thought that's how you'd feel, Nathanael.
I will not betray you, Nathanael.
Then, maybe I do see what you're after -- perhaps... you get to chose again...
And what is this, then?  Been off to fight the French because you are a patriot?  Or is this you, gaining your long sought after rise in society by becoming victorious in war!?
I say!
Mr. Lovejoy? That's cute, Bo.
Doesn't matter what it's called, Harry's got Martin Weir and it's gonna be big.
I mean I don't care.
And if we don't happen to find it under Palmer's mattress or inside Karen Flores' undie drawer? What then?
Calm down, Bear...
I have to ask you for that key.
I'd never make you as a burglar, not in that outfit.
That's right, me.
I put a gun right here...  ...and I tell him, 'Sign the paper Marty or your fuckin' dead.' Like that.
I wonder, would that work?  You know who I see for Al Roxy? Harvey Keitel. The man could do it in his sleep.
Yeah, I read it. I was just thinking you could make her older. We might even be able to get Karen Flores.
Who?
She's been out of movies a few years, but she's good. Real good.
That's all there is to it, huh?
Tell you what...
By Friday, man, or you're fuckin' dead as disco.
Who is this? I'm the one telling you the way it is, okay, asshole? That's who I am. Now you want your three hundred grand or don't you?
Hey, Zimm doesn't ask for dick. Zimm tells you the way it is... or else.
You say look at you?
So what brings you to L.A., Bones?
Leo spanked a waitress?
Apparently, way it went, he invited her to come to Santa Anita to play the ponies with him. She told him what to do with that and he gave her one on the tush. My guess, he's by his lonesome at the track right now.
Karen, it's a pleasure. How you doing?
They always paid.
Not really.
A blockbuster. But quality. No mutants or maniacs. This one's gonna be my "Driving Miss Daisy".
Who's the star?
He drown?
Heart attack. Apparently they brought a couple hookers along.
So you're thinking what if I was to put you next to my dry cleaner. Ask him if he wants to invest his money in a movie.
That, or I'm thinking what if some tragic accident were to befall the widow Saffrin -â€
Harry, I probably know 'em better than you do.
Cash. It happens to be waiting right at this moment in a locker at the airport.
Harry, if I gave you Leo's money you'd have Ray Bones all over your ass and then you'd be in a whole new kinda trouble.
Don't waste your time, Harry. The guy's not much of a movie fan. Now c'mon, gimme the key.
Hey, Bones, looks like you're gonna have a nice scar up there. Maybe these guys can fit you with a rug, cover it up for ya.
Twenty seven hundred.
Yeah. Kinda. Anyway, once I have the authentic sounds of speech, the rhythms, man, the patois, I can actually begin to think the way those guys do, get inside their heads.
So you want to know.
With what? Wiseguy money?
Martin, look at me.
What you're telling me, you're tired? You wanna go to bed?
How do I know that?
What's that?
Now you're down to three-ten in the case. You must've cooled off quite a bit since you got here.
No, it was open. It wasn't locked.
That's right. Three percent.
Ripped nylons work. Makes the shot more real.
...That's what we finally decided.
"Cotton".
That why Harry came over last night? See if you could help him get Martin in his movie?
Yeah, well Martin is known for his flipping. He flips over a script, and when the time comes to make a deal, he flips out.
I already read it. Harry left a copy at the house.
And you think the movie business is any different?
You were supposed to wait for me with Harry at the restaurant.
What happened?
Because a movie star can never order straight from the menu. They have to think of something they have to have that isn't on the menu.
You bet.
You don't act like it?
What I'm thinkin' is maybe Momo could buy it.
What're you talking about? You wanna be a movie star?
Harry, are you going down, or you want me to?
Harry -â€
Well. I got an audition tomorrow.
Yeah, Karen knows him.
I'm intrigued, yeah. You know what might help you, take a look at the Cylone again, the way a visual fabric is maintained even while the metaphor plays on different levels. Hey â€-  This your ride, Chili?
And after all, you have such morals.
Passenger vessel "Chimera." I will spell: charlie hotel india mary echo romeo alpha. No registry information is available at this time. I have determined to the best of my ability that the vessel has been abandoned on the high seas at position one seven four west, five seven north at...  Two zero one four hours zulu time. Over.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. Please advise your salvage authority pending registry check. Over.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. The vessel Chimera was registered to The Dobbins Kirk Line, Halifax.  Nova Scotia. Date of commission day nine month seven year one nine three two. Over.
Damn mind of it's own.
We'll see who's dreamin', m'man.
Yeah.
Thanks for the warning -- Ow! Damn!
I'm telling you, I saw somebody. I don't know who it was. But I saw somebody.
Right. Wednesday.
So we get a little more for the boat. Besides, the gold'll be safer where it is.
The sooner we get under way, the sooner we are to spending what's ours.
How about you Epps?
Fresh ain't the first word that comes to mind.
Could be meant as a warning.
Do what you need to do. Just do it fast.
With all due respect, skipper.  Part of that up there's mine. I'd kinda like to have a little say in what happens to it.
I think you know.
Then you're a lucky man.
Right.
Showed him a hell of a lot more than that.
Cargo like this could make a crew think twice.
Probably didn't have time.
You're a pal.
It's my pen name.
Yeah. Thanks.
She was a two-masted brig boat sailing out of New York in 1872.  One day she was sighted off the coast of Portugal by a merchant vessel, the Dei Gratia. As the crew of the Dei Gratia got closer, they discovered that no one was at the helm of the Mary Celeste. On boarding, they found her completely deserted. The captain, his wife, their daughter, and the entire crew, all gone. The last entry in their log made no mention of any trouble. The table was even set for dinner. And in the nine days after the last entry, she sailed 700 miles without anyone aboard.
Maybe. But there's always somebody whose interest's at stake.
What guy?
No. I'll try again later.
What?
February first.
Must not've been the captain's entry. He was probably out of the picture by then.
Hey.
Something bad happened here, Murphy.
Epps, over.
He's not on deck and I can't raise him on the radio.
We hit land.
Greer's gone. He broke out of the tank.
So you killed them?
I think maybe you been on this boat a little too long, with all that supernatural mumbo jumbo. There's nothing supernatural about greed. And that's what it comes down to, pure and simple.
Go.
Red sky in morning, sailor take warning.
Looks like it's adrift.
We've done it before.
Guess I must've fallen back to sleep. Where's Epps?
And get a bunch of fools sniffin' around here?
Supposing he wants to get bad with us?
We'll have to take it easy then. I don't think we'll find much aboard the ship, but it's probably worth looking around.
And look what happened.
Drink up then.
Say what?
I wish I could tell you. I'd be real interested to know myself.
Fine with me.
No, no. You got leak.
Fifteen, at the most.
Twenty. You knock off twenty and then we see. After my guy looks at it.
Who?
I-I really have to get up early for class tomorrow.
Yeah ... where is this? Bosnia?
Uh, well, that's okay - I don't dance, heh, heh...
Oh, all right... Party-pooper! Just let me put a few things away.
Oh -- please - don't let me interrupt finish your phone call.
Please tell me it isn't that teenager!
It's supposed to be Don Knotts.
Did you actually do this painting?
It's complicated... I guess I'm trying to show how racism used to -- more out in the open and now it's hidden, or something...
I'm not sure... I mean...  I guess because when we see something like this it seems really shocking and we have to figure out why it's so shocking?
Well, yes...
The whole business with the art show and the newspaper -- it's absolutely --
I didn't check my messages...
I'm sorry, Enid - you have to be an official high school graduate before I can nominate you.  I had to give it to someone else...  But I'm sure next year I can --
Why? What difference does it make? You already got his money...
Look, I'll be done in a minute. Just wait outside.
But this guy is like a one-of-kind, rare butterfly, and we have to follow him back to his natural habitat...
I just stopped in to say hi.
Nothing.
Then why do you hate me so much?
Yeah, well --
It's just my stupid way of getting attention! God, I practically love you, Josh!
Why not?
I thought Chipmunk-face was never going to shut up.
Yeah, I just picked the one that sounded the easiest.
Or maybe not.
Okay, well here's yours...  "Who said all the most eligible bachelors are taken? Not this one! Stunning bod, very snugglelicious ocean sunset dreamer."
Why do I always have to do it?
I know, look at the way he drives... he's like an old man.
Ew, it's like some gross rat...
It was so cute how he had his own little bags. I thought I was going to start crying!... Do you think they're gay?
You just want an excuse to dress like some stupid fashion model without me making fun of you.
Hey, you have to see my new good luck charm.
We have to do something fun tonight this is my last weekend of freedom before I start my stupid job.
Aw c'mon, this is a fun party.
No way... when?
At least the wheelchair guy is sort of entertaining...
Nothing. Don't worry... I promise I'll get a job next week.
That's not true, I just hate all these obnoxious, extroverted, pseudo- bohemian losers!  Sometimes I think I act so weird because I'm crazy from sexual frustration.
Haven't you heard about the miracle of masturbation?
Fuck it. Everything must go!
I am not -- I just think it'd be funny to see what he'd do...
Don't you want nice stuff?
Oh yeah... maybe... Seymour's going on his big date tonight and I kind of want to be around when he calls, so I can hear how bad it went.
Yeah well, you said you were busy... look, I'd better get going... I'll call you tomorrow.
Because you'll freak out and act like a total psycho about it.
You're the one who's still living out some stupid seventh-grade fantasy!
Make sure you're here by noon - we have tons of stuff to do... Oh yeah! I have to show you something else!
Actually, he's a really nice guy.
Maybe an orange juice.
Listen, young lady... I know you don't like me -- I don't really care whether you do or not -- but I will not allow you to treat your father the way you do.
How much is this?
Tell me what?
That's not even --
...are you waiting for a bus?
Yeah, well sure... you can if you want to... it's just I don't want all these guys in there at once... you know...
Yeah right... If I'm so cool, why haven't I had a girlfriend in four years? I can't even remember the last time a girl talked to me.
We'll just go in for one minute -- it'll be a riot!
I brought it for him to autograph. He's going to be amazed to see it - it's one of two known copies... I can't believe they have him for the opening act and not the headliner. What an insult!
Just wait here.
"Four-piece Cook's special deep fried with side n' slaw it's OUT RAY-GEOUS"!
What are you, a fry cook or something?
Nothing so glamorous... actually, I'm an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters.
No, Doofus... blow it out!
Who knows?
It's just somebody's idea of a joke...
That didn't sound like a joke to me... what, did you write a personal ad or something?
Actually, it's kind of still happening... she's over here right now... I think everything's going pretty well...
What, are you going to like have sex with her on your first date?
Oh... pretty well, surprisingly... you know...
I... I don't know. I don't really think I should...
No, no... not exactly... she just doesn't understand how I would know somebody like you...
What does she mean by that - "somebody like me"?
Does that mean you don't like me?
Nothing. Don't worry, I won't bother you any more.
What about this?
You're a beautiful young girl... I can't imagine you would ever have had any interest in me, except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity.
You know what we should do? Let's go get in your car right now and just take off! We could just drive away and find some new place and start a whole new life... fuck everybody!
I'm serious! I'm just so sick of everybody! Why can't I just do whatever I want?
Still torturing yourself over that Enid, huh?
No problem.
Talk to us about it...
This shocking image of repressed femininity!
Josh!? Why would she be with Josh?
She just mentioned him a few times and said that they had been dating - I thought maybe she was...
Why wouldn't she tell me? There's no way! She could never keep that to herself... you're crazy.
Yes?
On that I choose to remain dubious.  Two are dead now in two nights. 
-you do not call me a liar- you know nothing of their health- consider yourself fortunate I persuaded so many to stay- consider yourself fortunate I have decided to stay-
So work must be going well?
It hasn't been that simple so far.
Karim will have to show me where it happened. And of course, I'll need the donkey.  With any luck, I'll sort it out tonight. 
You never had it.
Nigel and I don't like each other much.
-oh please- if I'd been against your taking this, you would have abandoned me. You've been desperate to see Africa your whole life.
We know three things about man-eaters. First, they always return to where they've attacked before. Second, they're always old- they can't catch other animals so they turn to us. And third, they're always alone- they've been cast out by their pride because they can't keep up.
I'd love the company. And I've hunted all my life.
But it's crazy- the lion shouldn't be that hungry this soon.  Samuel?
Only in life... 
But of course yours worked.
I'll have to.
Understood- you realize now you could never have done it without me.
Fine. Get started. And a strict curfew- no one allowed out at night.  Send half your men to the bridge, the rest with these two.  And I'm sorry for my tone earlier. But I repeat- there is no reason for fear. I will kill the lion and I will build the bridge.
You give me hope, John. 
I don't believe you had a mother. 
I'm sorry.  Perhaps some other time.
I'm not saying you did.  In science we always look for the simplest explanation.
I won't.
Okay, okay.  It's not my job, but what the hell.  I'll do you a favor.  He takes the grocery bags from her.
That's exactly what you said last week.
Unusual?  I don't know.  I haven't had a lot of experience with babies.
You mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug?
Good luck.
Really?  And how would we handle the sleeping arrangements?
Yes, I'm very clean.  Did they find anything at my apartment?
For one night in your life, do you think it's possible for us to be completely real?
All right, you want to be real?  So tell me why did you dump me?
So why don't you give me a jingle in the year 2000?
No, you can't, and I think that's the whole problem with aliens; you just can't trust them. You may get some nice ones occasionally like Starman or E.T., but most of them turn out to be some kind of lizard.  Anyway, we're just about out of time.  Next week on 'World of the Psychic,' hairless pets.  Until then, this is Peter Venkman saying ...  ... Good night.
Now you're talking.
What are you doing up here?
I was trying to get that smelly green thing. The guys asked me to help out.  I'm like the fifth Ghostbuster.
You're right.  We should stay.
I know.
-- the sorrow of Moldavia --
Your honor, ladies and gentlemen of the --  audience.  I don't think it's fair to call my clients frauds.  Okay, the blackout was a big problem for everybody.  I was stuck in an elevator for about three hours and I had to go to the bathroom the whole time, but I don't blame them because once I turned into a dog and they helped me.  Thank you.
I fixed you up with Diane Troxler and she put out, didn't she?
I predict that the world will end at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve.
This is not just some money-making scheme!  I didn't just make up the date.  I have a strong psychic belief that the world will end on New Year's Eve.
It's a rough translation from the Moldavian.
And we're the ...
We need something that everyone can get behind, a symbol --
I knew that voice sounded familiar.  What's up?  How's it going?
Oh, Ray --
If he wasn't dead he'd be an Olympic prospect.
We're going down into the sewer system to see if we can trace the source of the psycho-reactive slime flow.  We thought you might want to come along.
Darn it!  I wish I'd known you were going. I'm stuck with these damn dinner reservations.
Come on, Winston.  We can't quit now.  The holidays are coming up.  It's our best season.
You finished here?
Yeah, I guess so.  It was the strangest thing.  I knew what I was doing but I couldn't stop.  This really terrible feeling came over me and -- I don't know -- I just felt like driving into that tree and ending it all.  Whew!  Sorry, boys.
Oh yeah?  Anytime, anytime.  Just go ahead and try it.
Groovy.  I've never felt better in my life.
Nice going, honey.  It was brand new.
Uuuuuuugh!!
No.  They're just coming to me.
I got the Twister game for later ...
I'll wait here if you don't mind.
You must have gotten the last copy.
I've got to go now.
Take me now.
But why?  The students love us!
I see.
Is that a game?
In the physical sense.
What calls?
Has this ever happened before?
Heavens, no!  The owners don't like us to even talk about it.  I hoped we could take care of this quietly tonight.
And would this storage facility be located on these premises?
And may I see this storage facility?
No, you may not.
That's "Peck!"
Good guess -- but no.
Two wavy lines?
Yeah, but I didn't know you were going to give me electric shocks.  What are you trying to prove?
Were you recently in the bathroom?
Egon, somehow this reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole in your head.  Do you remember that?
I'm always serious.
Wow!
Yeah, yeah.  I was just thinking.  It probably wouldn't be a good idea for them to get together at this point.
Yes.  After the First World War Shandor decided that society was too sick to survive.  And he wasn't alone.  He had close to a thousand followers when he died.  They conducted rituals, bizarre rituals, intended to bring about the end of the world.
Peter, at 1:40 this afternoon at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, ten people witnessed a free-roaming, vaporous, full-torso apparition.  It blew books from shelves at twenty feet away.  Scared the socks off some poor librarian.
It looks like a big pair of breasts and a pot belly.
What do I say?
Anything!  Just make contact.
Do you know when that might be?  We're on the brink of a very serious cash-flow problem.
I don't know.  I'm just guessing.
No!  Nobody ever built them like this!  The architect was either an authentic whacko or a certified genius.  The whole building is like a huge antenna for pulling in and concentrating psychokinetic energy.
That's what you told me two days ago!
Let some time pass... then ask, quietly, without anyone knowing it comes from me.
You can't do that!  You came here to turn the crowd around not make them hate you.
Do you want posters, too?
You would have had a full scale revolt on your hands.
Respectfully Caesar, Quintus and I must report.
That's difficult to say, general.
Do we really need to repair this fort?  It seems like an expensive undertaking.  I propose we burn it to the ground.  That way if the Germans cross the Danube here there will be nothing to help them build an offensive position.
You flatter me, Caesar.
Being as close, I'm certain you've noticed what we all have noticed.
On what charge?
Sacks of grain, even bread.  I own the grain licenses for the military, I can arrange to divert a shipment bound for the army of the Danube.
Take grain away from the army?
Make a gift to the people.  It's your money anyway so it's only fair.
You don't want to kill him.  If anything happens to him now you will be blamed... and he knows it. Besides, that gladiator school is a fortress.  It would take the army to break in there.  What you want is to... offer him the wooden sword. If he takes it, he's no longer the champion of the people, is he?  He's gone.  And you are a hero for awarding it.
Caesar, I did my best.  The Colosseum isn't under my control...
We need more statues -- perhaps I should open medical clinics.  For the poor.  Citizens only, though...
My only visits to Rome, Senator, have been through books.  But the war's over, time to close the door of war once and for all.
You don't know how wrong you are.
There's no reason to say that. Everyone knows you're going to be well.  I had Servis groom your horse for a triumphal visit to the front at first light.
So I understand.
On my honor as your daddy...
Well, we can try...
Well, they die for it!
I was summoned.
They're studying with Cynics.
Of course...
If you win, you know, you have to stay.  It's the losers who get to go home.  Besides, I'm not so sure it is over.  Centurions report enemy scouts probing our lines.
Who else?  I'm the one who runs the estates while you're here risking everything we have for the glory of Rome!  Or for the glory of you!
Narcissus!
I don't want you to die!
Condemned?  Aren't I owed a trial before being condemned?
General, all I know is you have been condemned to the Colosseum, and a trial is nowhere to be seen.
So I pretend I'm dead.  You get gold, what do I get?
It's absolutely not like that!  This is for your own good!  Come on get the rest of your armor on!
Fantastic!  Wonderful!  But posters are very expensive.
Right, right... But they'll have to bring in a lawyer.  I don't want to get sued over this.
I'll do it!  Sure as there's shit in the Tiber we're all going to die, but for you -- anything!
If it's all right with you, I'm not hungry.
I don't know.
No -- I was just thinking -- look -- it's still early -- we could do something -- go somewhere else.
During the day? We'll go for a drive or something.
Yes.
-- really incredible --
Did you say rape her?
Then you took her upstairs and you raped her.
The marble?
I don't know.
But Elaine --
Is that so? You might marry me?
How about tomorrow? I don't mean to be pushy but --
I don't see how we can.
Well -- I said I might marry him.
He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.
There is a great future in plastics. Think about it. Will you think about it?
Okay. Enough said. That's a deal.
Screaming isn't all right. Not in my house it isn't.
Get out!
Will you bring up my purse before you go?
Benjamin -- I am getting pretty tired of all this suspicion. Now if you won't do me a simple favor I don't know what.
Benjamin?
-- and I was wondering if I could buy you a drink or something --
Where are you?
I'll be there in an hour.
I mean I'd -- I'd rather not go to the trouble of bringing it all in. I just have a toothbrush. I can get it myself. If that's all right.
Oh. Well actually, I'd just as soon find it myself. I just have the toothbrush to carry up and I think I can manage it myself.
Whatever you say, sir.
In general.
My husband took the car. Will you drive me home?
Let's go.
Look -- I drove you home. I was glad to do it. But I have some things on my mind. Can you understand that?
What?
Sit down.
Have you ever seen Elaine's portrait?
Yes.
No.
Benjamin?
Will you unzip my dress?
Because you're going to bed. I don't think I should be up here.
What if he did?
Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?
Because I find you very attractive and any time --
Do you want to get it now?
I'll be up in five minutes.
Isn't there something you want to tell me?
Well -- I want you to know how much I appreciate this -- really --
The room number, Benjamin. I think you ought to tell me that.
You're welcome. Well -- I'll see you later, Mrs. Robinson.
Why don't you watch?
Oh -- sure. Thank you.
Okay.
You can admit that, can't you?
It's nothing to be ashamed of --
On your first time --
INADEQUATE!
Mrs. Robinson. If that's the best we can do let's just get the goddamn clothes off and --
I don't.
What?
He's asleep.
But what about the noise from the car. What if --
The driveway's on my side of the house.
Can I undress and talk at the same time?
Thank you.
No.
Not exactly.
I don't.
I mean it doesn't sound like it could be much worse. If you hated him at least you'd hate him.
What?
Think real hard, Benjamin.
Don't tell Elaine.
Oh no. You had to marry him because you got pregnant?
Are you shocked?
All right. Now let's get to bed.
I mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances?
Really. I want to know.
It was a Ford, Benjamin.
I have my reasons.
Are you?
I didn't mean it. I don't think you'd be right for each other. But I would never say you weren't as good a person as she is.
Well it's pretty obvious you don't want me around any more.
But if it's sickening for you --
Promise me, Benjamin.
All right, for christ's sake. I promise I will never take out Elaine Robinson.
Listen to me very carefully, Benjamin. You are not to see Elaine again. Ever. Those are my orders. Is that clear?
Where is Elaine?
What the hell have you done?
Sir?
Goodnight, sir.
You don't have to tell me if you don't want.
No, I do. I want to tell you.
I do.
Well -- it's very comfortable -- just to drift here.
Have you thought about graduate school?
No.
Now listen, Ben. I think it's a very good thing that a young man -- after he's done some very good work -- should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself, and lie around, and drink beer and so on. But after a few weeks I believe that person would want to take some stock in himself and his situation and start to think about getting off his ass.
Yes, sir.
That's a hell of a good age to be.
Ben, can I say something to you?
How long have we known each other now?
Thank you.
Ben -- I want you to give her a call.
I will.
That's what I'd do if I could. Nothing wrong with that. Hey Ben, Elaine's coming down from Berkeley soon. I want you to call her up this time.
Yes.
Is there something I've said that's caused this contempt? Or is it just the things I stand for that you despise?
Well, Ben, it was quite a bit to do with me.
You miss the point.
Yes?
Benjamin Braddock.
Twenty-one-years-old, ladies and gentlemen; four of those years spent accomplishing some rather extraordinary things at one of our nation's leading seats of learning --
I told you I'll get the pearls tonight.
No.
Why?
With the pearls?
With the pearls --
Oh!
Reducing?
Yes -- yes indeed -- but you are a...  ...a stenographer. Don't little stenographers earn little pennies?
Where downstairs?
Well -- such is life, Flaemmchen.
No irony. You're so appealing -- so soft -- so tired. I feel like taking you in my arms and not letting anything more happen to you -- ever.
Strange man...
And...?
I saw you just now -- then I saw you cry -- and now I see you in the mirror -- Grusinskaya...
Really, I haven't a bit of character. None at all.
And then, in the war, to kill and hide. That's all.
Please look at me. You must believe me -- you must believe that I love you -- that I have never known what love is -- until last night. 
I'll not denounce you.
Yesterday I was a thief -- but now, --
Suzette will be back here in a minute.
Six twenty-seven in the morning... But the money?
I can't.
Oh, a Baron! 
Do I know him -- I know him through and through.
Yes, quite.
In the Yellow Room, where the music's playing and the ladies are?
Gambling! I'd like that. I have over six thousand eight hundred marks with me.
All right then.
You've lost everything?
I thought she was splendid!
Yes -- He always seems to be waiting for something -- and nothing ever comes.
I must have made a mistake.
Don't do that. 
Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought.
News? Yes -- killing in number one- sixty-four.
It seems that he was a thief and an imposter.
But Doctor --
Fourteen thousand marks... One can travel -- one's happiness might depend on fourteen thousand marks -- don't you think so, Baron?
Stay where you are.
I never danced before -- in public.
Oh -- what -- what -- 
Quick -- something awful -- awful has happened. Go -- go at once, -- Mr. Preysing --
Then why did you have anything to do with him?
Then you will please wait outside.
Yes, I photograph very well. Look --
Can't you understand me?
Definitely off.
Wait -- I must figure it up.  First, I'll need -- clothes -- shoes -- it's cold in England in March, I'll need a suit... You'd want me to look nice?
I had to arrange about the trip.
You're a funny little creature, Flaemmchen. I can't make you out.
I mean with the Manchester people?
Yes --
We did not approach you.
I've done my hair differently -- do you like that?
In the middle of the night -- those flowers make me think of a funeral. Laurels and tube-roses.  Oh, think, Suzette -- the Villa and the sun at Tremezzo -- quiet -- simple -- happy -- we'll have a guest, Suzette.
I wish to be alone.
Good morning, Gru -- your --
Yes, Pimenov.  One minute, Suzette, I will call you.
But when did he go? How do you know?
Does that mean that the bath is my own? --- Private?
Go away -- go away.
Yes you -- shut your mouth -- get out -- you're discharged.
Her room -- oh -- I see, Mr. Preysing -- I understand, Mr. General Director Preysing.
If the house is empty again, I don't know --
Have I kept you waiting?
Waiting -- I'm waiting for news from Manchester.
I know -- I know.
I saw Gerstenkorn at lunch -- and as your lawyer I made it my business to broach the matter ---
I'll see you in the morning then, at the conference. Everything'll be all right, Preysing... Don't worry. Goodnight.
No one would have thought it of me. I've been getting rusty in Fredersdorf. Well, if bluff is what the world wants I guess I can put up as big a bluff as anyone. From now on... 
Say it -- say it -- my lie -- it's the first time in thirty years that I've ever... Where's that stenographer? Miss Flaemm...
She had an engagement in the Yellow Room at five o'clock -- she was in a hurry.
My son was in the hospital --
Tell me about the oranges, Lilly.
And if you do it wrong?
Gee, I better not, if it's okay. I still gotta drive back up to Los Ang-gleez.
A person that don't look out for himself is too dumb to look out for anybody else. He's a liability, right, Bobo?
I will. So long, Bobo.
Oh, I know, I know, and you've been wonderful since I was widowed. But Mister Hebbing has--  -- you don't mind my telling him, darling --  -- suffered reverses. If he could...
I certainly hope not.
Well, make it stop!
Take two, three days. Call when you get there.
Why, of course it is. I can offer you -- well, five hundred dollars.
So I heard.
I guess I'm just not a leader of men.
A well-rounded life. I respect that. But it has to have a center, Roy, something you care about, something you can think about.
Fair enough.
What are you talking about? So I've got a job. So what?
Sure.
You don't have the stomach for it.
That's right.
Roy, I don't want money from you.
I pay my debts.
Even so. You still got time. Relax a minute, tell me what happened. Sit down.
No, you wouldn't. That's what she was after, though. But why hit on me?
As though you do what I say.
Don't be sorry. You're not taking it.
And Myra's stuff?
Oh? I didn't know anything was.
Never.
Well, I guess I got it wrong, then. Seems to me I heard about a guy just your age that got hit so hard in the guts it almost killed him.
Sure, sure, that doesn't count. That's different.
Well, it doesn't matter, does it? I'm getting out.
It isn't the owner, Myra, it's my wife. She knows what's going on. This time, I gotta have the money.
My wife sent me here, Myra. For the money. She's waiting.
I can't. I just left home.
You're too young. You should be in school.
Let's find out.
Oh, I am, baby, believe me.
You do. And once I'm out of here, I'll remind you of the best parts.
You're just comfortable, that's all. You don't even ask to go home. You just lie around, let your mama take care of you.
I don't like to come here, Roy. Every time I do, your mother comes in and makes remarks.
I'm a salesman.
Is that right?
Atascadero.
Join up with you! I watched you, Roy, I've been watching you, wondering if I should talk about this at all, or maybe just... 
Take a hike, you mean?
You and me, Roy. What a team we'll make. We think alike; we get along together. Once or twice a year we take some slob, the rest of the time we live like this. You won't regret this, Roy.
Come on, Myra, don't talk business here. This is time out.
I called a fellow I know in Tulsa, the one who plays my chauffeur. There's a sucker there he says is made for us. And a boroker that just shut down, we can use their office, not change a thing! Now, I can scrape up ten grand without much trouble. That leaves fifteen or twenty for your end. We could start this weekend, get the sucker into position --
I don't think I need it.
Bullshit!
Sure it is. That's why you act so funny around each other.
Well, mostly, I don't believe it.
No. I mean, I don't believe it. Lilly is not a suicide. I know my mother, nothing would make her check out.
It may be Lilly, but it isn't suicide.
I'm sorry, that's an unfortunate phrase, it slipped out, I'm, to tell you the truth, Mr. Dillon, this isn't an everyday occurrence around here.
Well, let's get the shock over with.
No blood on the knife.
Where?
Only the real stiffs.
I'd prefer you didn't.  I'm very busy.
Michael Meyers never used a meat cleaver.  It was a butcher knife.
No shit.
Okay, you win.  I'll call you Mom. Now can I move into the dorms?
My point exactly.  See, we both agree.
Nothing.
Call me Laurie, will ya?
That would work.
Why not?
Bye Will.
Michael Meyers.
We've got to get these kids out of here...
I thought you were allergic to latex.
I'll pop a Benadryl.
What if it's Kara?
I promise.
A man came by the house.  A psychiatrist by the name of Loomis.
What the fuck are you doing letting strangers in without --
Black magic ...  'In ancient times, Thorn was believed to cause sickness, famine and death. Translated literally, it was the name of a demon spirit that delivered human sacrifices ... on the Celtic celebration of Samhain.'
Wait a minute ...
It's a sign.  He's come home.
I'm here now, Jamie.  You're going to live. You have to.
Sam, you know you never fail to amaze me.  Yesterday happily retired, today right back in the thick of things. Somehow I knew you still had it in you.
She has the gift -- the blood of Thorn running through her veins.  Michael's mother had it, too.  So for six years I incubated her, prepared her for this night.  Michael has served his purpose.  And soon we will have a new progeny.
I know he's alive.  People in this town -- they want us to believe he's dead.  But I know. I've always known.
Right now at least one girl is dead and Jamie Lloyd is in there fighting for her life.  She is the last of his blood line.  If she dies --
A bitch.
How all the magazines show tits today.
At least we found the diamonds.
Thank God we found the fucking diamonds!
Go home!  Show them how rich you are for a change!
Can I have the Cadillac?
How short the skirts are.
The world is teeming with women-- ours to enjoy.
I dunno.
All the more reason to go to Africa.
I wouldn't want to be married to me. We're too crazy.  You know?
I wanted to apologize.
Get used to it.  Back door, Paul.
I just want one true adventure before I die.
You--you aren't going to have any friends left, if you don't watch out.
Thank God!
Do you know who Wanda June is?
She went to the fight with Herb Shuttle, I guess.
I was going to a funny movie, but I changed my mind.  If you're depressed, laughing doesn't help much.  When did you know my father?
Everybody says he was so brave.
Even this--"Herb Shuttle", you said?
"Harold, the Patron Saint of Taxidermy."
England?
Dad was never in England?
"The sting."
We blacked our hands and faces.  At midnight we crept out of the forest and into the village.  The name of the village was Mhravitch. Remember that name!
Mhravitch.
We caught another Kraut alone in a back lane.  Your father choked him to death with a length of piano wire.  Your father was quite a virtuoso with piano wire.  That's nicer than a knife, isn't it--as long as you don't look at the face afterwards.  The face turns a curious shade of avocado.  I must ask the doctor why that is.  At any rate, we stole into the back of the inn, and, with the permission of the management, we poisoned the wine of six Krauts who were carousing there.
Where did you get the poison?
I wanted to go out for football, but Mom was afraid I'd get hurt.
They're not engaged.
Alive and hale.  He's throwing a little surprise party for his own family.  Is your mother often this unstable?  Penelope!
The smallest thing I've got.
What do you do for a living?
Some kind of animal?
Give us time, Harold--to adjust to your being alive.
I could carve a better man out of a banana!
Please--
He thought he could take my place. It is now my privilege to give an unambiguous account of why I don't think he's man enough to do that.
Buy yourself breakfast.  There we go.
Just--bang--we have a honeymoon.
Which one?
Don't lecture me on race relations. I don't have a molecule of prejudice.  I've been in battle with every kind of man there is. I've been in bed with every kind of woman there is--from a Laplander to a Tierra del Fuegian. If I'd ever been to the South Pole, there'd be a hell of a lot of penguins who looked like me.  Cook!
This is not a coy deception.  I do not want to be scrogged.  I want love.  I want tenderness.
Fish can't feel.
And he keeps it in his apartment?
I came for Paul as well.
He knows you shattered his violin.
Almost a Christmas scene.
He's in East St. Louis with his mother--visiting an aunt.
What kind of a country has this become?  The men wear beads and refuse to fight--and the woman adore them.  America's days of greatness are over.  It has drunk the blue soup.
Blue soup?
That's really what you want.  You become furious when people won't make you dead.
Honor, I suppose.
No.
I mean it!
Do it, Norbert.
Hello, Mother.
Oh, oh, oh--I thought it was your apartment.  You seemed at home here.
She still has just the one child-- the boy?
Yes!  Please!  You've got to get out right now!
I've literally got to run!
You've been bitten by bats?
There's a certain amount of information there.
It's healer to killer.  Is that the same thing?
You're old--so old.
Comical?
This is going to become very physical.  Are you prepared for that?
In any event, I will not beg for mercy.
If you want to be found that way.
New lives begin!
Leave the rifle here.
You don't know?
She did?
For what?
Honey--Alcoholics Anonymous takes all the time I've got--and Harold Ryan is an individual I would rather forget.  He drove me to drink.  He drove his first two wives to drink.
You were Harold Ryan's third wife. Right?
Ja?
Don't!
Men can touch other men, and it doesn't mean a thing.  Haven't you ever seen football players after they've won the Superbowl?
Oh, Paul--
What difference does that make?  Is Dr. Woodly going to be my father now?
Then who flushed the toilet?
He'd assume we had.
When Harold is definitely out of the picture, Penelope, when I don't have to worry about doing him wrong or you wrong or Paul wrong.  I'm going to ask you to be my wife.
The park!
You were wonderful.
What's so wonderful if I lost the sale?  You poor kid.
Take plenty of cigars.
After this explosion, I think, he'll be able to accept the fact that his mother is going to marry again.
The only thing I ever told him about life was, "Keep out of the park after the sun goes down."
No!  Oh no!  Three people murdered in there in the last six weeks! The police won't even go in there any more.
I'd be dead by now if that were the case.
Me, too.  I know something not even the police know--what's in the park at midnight.  Nothing.  Or, when I'm in there, there's me in there. Fear and nobody and me.
No.  But he's going to be.  If he is in the park and he comes out safely on the other side, I can say to him, "You and I are the only men with balls enough to walk through the park at midnight."  On that we can build.
Tell her to have a nice trip.
Phooey.
If he'd just come out for the Little League, the way I asked him, he'd find out we touch all the time--shove each other, slug each other, and just horse around.  I'm going to go get him--
Albert Einstein plays shuffleboard.
Jack the Ripper plays shuffleboard.
You bet! "The Harold Ryan Fan Club." Pink, eh?  With a yellow streak up the back.  We got very good tailor shops up here.  They'll make you any kind of uniform, any kind of sweatsuit you want.  Judas Iscariot--he's got this black jacket with a skull and crossbones over the heart.  He walks around all hunched over, and he never looks anybody in the eye, and written on the back of his jacket are the words, "Go take a flying--
There's something wrong here. Kristen is not the type of girl to just up and leave.
If he has anything to say about it, yeah. I've been asking a lot of questions and I don't like the answers I'm getting. He's made a lot of people nervous, including some poor faggot who thought he was going to be a movie star.
Big threat. TV would ream you.
You want a tip?
What do you mean?
I said I just wanted to talk to you...
Don't you think it's a little too... bright?
No, no. I wouldn't hire a display designer if I didn't trust her taste. Maybe we should bring in more of that shade. Perhaps a stripe across the back wall.
The other girl is the star?
No.
Yeah.
Hey, don't worry about it. Your daughter's around. We'll find her in a couple days.
You won't keep growing at this rate.
Is that the way it was with you?
How important do you think sex is?
He deals in pain.
He has to. That's Predestination. If God is omniscient, if He knows everything -- and He wouldn't be God if He didn't -- then He must have known, even before the creation of the world, the names of those who would be saved.
Grand Rapids? Of course.
On your own land?
Granville?
So I guess we're both fucked, huh? But at least you get to go to heaven. I don't get shit.
Mr. Van Dorn?
Yeah. You ever seen any of those?
Hmm.
I don't know.
Who is Ratan?
Go home, pilgrim. There's nothing you can do. Forget this place. Start over.
Leave me alone. Go home. Go away.
Jim Sullivan. Sometimes they call me Jism Jim.
She's got a man. A white guy. Tod something or other.
I don't know.
Do you work for the San Francisco Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
Yeah. I heard you and Ratan just came from Mexico. And that you had a film of a girl being, ah you know...
Ratan!
What we got is just these here.  What you see.
Well, Bill -- mind if I call you Bill?  Let me be frank. I've made a lot of money. I've got my own business in Detroit. Rivets. I make rivets and sell them to Fisher Body.  Well, rivets, you know, can get pretty boring after a while. When my business manager told me I should shelter some money, I thought I'd try this.
Calm down, mister. You don't want to get the cops in here do you? You got a family?
You ever play Chicken?
I'm off that case. He fired me.
I'll tell you, that was an interesting case. The Van Dorn girl. I've handled runaway cases like it before. Usually when you put the pressure on the porn underworld for an underage kid, she pops up in about a week. Everybody denies ever seeing her, but there she is at the airport with a prepaid ticket home. Well, I put pressure on all over town for this girl and it stayed cold as ice. In fact, certain people for this girl and -- nothing.  I guess I gave your brother-in-law sort of a raw deal.
Look again, Billy-boy. This is jail bait. Could get you in a lotta trouble.
About forty-five minutes, wouldn't you say, Harold? We were hoping to start sooner but, you see, it's rather hard to find a truck.
Lady, let me get this straight.
Lady, is it true you're driving without a license?
Check.
I'm a file clerk.
How do you do? I am Dame Marjorie Chardin, but you may call me Maude.
Nice to meet you.
But this is my car.
My door is always open.
All right.
Oh. Eh, I like it.
Me. Ha! Did I tell you I'll be eighty on Saturday?
That's a nice teapot.
I don't know. Just one of those. 
Over there by the courthouse.
That little tree. It's in trouble. Come on.
Oh, wait, Maude. Look!
What is that he's working on?
It is kind of rough.
Yes, so do I. But I think he is a little... old-fashioned. Like a puff, Harold?
You are the wisest person I know.
Me!  When I look around me I know I know nothing. I remember though, once long ago in Persia, we met a wise man in the bazaar. He was a professional and used to sell his wisdom to anyone willing to pay. His specialty for tourists was a maxim engraved on the head of a pin. "The wisest," he said, "the truest, the most instructive words for all men at all times." Frederick bought one for me and back at the hotel I peered through a magnifying glass to read the words - "And this too shall pass away."  Well, the wise man was right - if you remember that, you can't help but live life fully.
Boy! It sure has been a wonderful day. And you - you are beautiful.
You've never cried before. I never thought you would. I thought, despite anything, you could always be happy.
Ah, yes.
I'm sure. But what else do you do with your time? Do you go to school?
You mean when I'm not working on a...
What else do you like?
I go to funerals.
I see.  Were you happy at school, Harold?
Why?
Perfectly lovely. You know, this is what we're defending. Everything that's good and beautiful in the American way of life. Oh, there's some nut peace petitioner over there. Let's go off this way. Those crazy Commie bastards. I don't know why we tolerate 'em. Parasites.
The moment of truth.
Another man's life in your sights.
Yes.
Of your kill - ears, nose, scalp, privates.
Perhaps you're teasing us. Are you teasing us?
Almost complete withdrawal. She hasn't said a word for nearly two years.
Oh yeah? On your own a lot, Huh?
You DIDN'T tell me. Do you mean Malahide's got...
Because I'm going to get my father!
No. Don't let it. You've come this far.
Red -- you need to hear the rest of the information --
-- Hound of resurrection?
There is a place -- a dark place where evil slumbers and awaits to return. From there it infects our dreams. Our thoughts. Grigory gave us a glance tonight --
No. It was red. Bright red.
I thought you liked being on TV.
Oh, stop that --  Damn! Be careful, there --
"Myers", huh? You have a first name??
You call that thing a cigar??
Oh-n-no -- I --
What are you, a Boy Scout?
Hostage negotiations.
For a cup of coffee, but go ahead, read.
No. Myers is taking me.
No... He's determined. Unstoppable --
A brute.
Two steps back, please.
Look, do you want the bed in or not?
Who are you calling a fucking ass- hole? It's this bastard bed that's your fucking problem!
It'll go in.
Her mother's dead.
Lucky man.
No!
You remember.
Don't mourn him. He was dead long before we laid a finger on him.
Oh.
I'm sorry. Of course. You're very welcome.
I don't want to see the dress.
Tell me who you are.
The Cenobites. It's only a matter of time before they find I've slipped them. I have to get away from here.
The Cenobites. The creatures the box set free.  Sometimes I think they're still here. Just behind the walls. Them and their hooks and their beasts. Just waiting to break out again. Except that I've got the box.
You would be. They tore me apart.
And the blood let you out?
I don't.
The keys are in the kitchen.
No. I'm not.
Are you O.K.?
What's wrong with you?
I try not to drink at lunch-time. Makes me sleepy in the afternoon. You like to keep a clear head, eh?  One soda, one whisky.  I do it anyway. No will-power. Got a busy afternoon?
You know you are. Loveliest woman I ever set eyes on.
What's wrong?
My father doesn't answer. I have to go find him.
You will keep in touch.
Kitchen's through on your left.
Never better. You sleep well.
What?
He's gone.
I'm afraid it's true.
What's the problem?
No. It's all over.
If I make it through the day.
You gotta be kidding me.
You just drove a fucking customer away, Barry.
I don't want you talking to our customers like that again.
He offended me with his terrible taste.
What do you mean, "what?"
Oh no, Rob, that's not obvious enough. Not at all.  Dick, did you hear that?
To me, it would mean that you're a liar.  You saw it twice.  Once with Laura -- oops -- once with me and Dick.  We had that conversation about the possibilities of the guy making ammo off-screen in the Fourteenth Century.
But in your opinion, would I definitely go?
What band?
You are not in a band, Barry.  You are not a musician.  And no posters.
Thanks for your support, Rob.  Really appreciate it.
How many tickets can I put you down for?
Bitter?  Because I'm not in Barrytown? You should be shot like a lame horse, you jerk.  Just keep that out of my window.
Yes way.  It's really...
110%.  That's my final offer.  I'm not kidding.  That's how much it means to me not to hear you play.
Because it's sentimental tacky crap, that's why not.  Do we look like the kind of store that sells "I Just Called To Say I Loved You?" Go to the mall and stop wasting our time.
NO--!
Oh well.  Nevermind.
That's what I said.
Anna who?  Anna Green Gables?  Anna Conda?
Anna Moss.
He's not worth it!
The Malcolm McClaren of Clark Street is in his executive suite.  Do you have an appointment?
I thought I would ask you a few questions if that's okay.
So.  Is now a good time?
Your desert island top-five.
Is there a difference?
Uh...yes, at the moment.
Great.  Gotta go.  See you then.
Oh God, no.  I didn't want to hurt his feelings.
'Cause you like their second one, you said, Pop, Girls. etc.  The one with Cheryl Ladd on the cover.  You didn't see the cover though.
The new Belle and Sebastian.  Like it?
I am fine...  I gotta go.  Goodbye.
Yeah, well, I've stopped all that now.
What's the obvious stuff?
Rob.  Don't be childish.
So, what, you haven't definitely decide to dump me?  There's still a chance we'll get back together?
Well, if you don't know, there's a chance, right?  It's like, if someone was in the hospital and he was seriously ill and the doctor said, I don't know if he's got a chance of survival or not, then that doesn't mean the patient's definitely going to die, now does it?  It means he might live.  Even if it's only a remote possibility.
Okay, okay, we have a nine percent chance of getting back together. Does that clarify the situation?
Jesus Christ, Rob.  Is that really what's bothering you?
Of course it is.
I haven't felt like it.
You know I didn't mind.  And it's not as if Ray's place is any better.
Sure they are.
They're not really, though, are they? I know you bought them for me, and that was really sweet of you, but that was when you were trying to turn me into you.  I can't take them, I know they'd just sit around staring at me, and I'd feel embarrassed by them and... they don't fit in with the rest of what's mine, do you understand?  That Sting record you bought for me... that was a present for me.  I like Sting and you hate him.  But the rest of this stuff...  Who the hell is Nick Lowe?  Or Gram Parsons?  Or the Boredoms?  I don't know these people.  I...
Okay, okay.  I get the picture.
Well, think about it.
God, that's a cold and a half.  Maybe you should bet back in bed.
Pig died.
No, no.  When are you going home?
Yes, of course.
Liz'll give you a lift.  She knows where to go and everything... I don't have time to talk, Rob.  I've got too much to do.
What?
I want to feel something else than this.  It's either that or I go home and put my hand in the fire.  Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm.
I knew there was a reason I wore a skirt today.
Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through that again.
Ray's a disaster.  I don't know what that was all about, except that sometimes you need someone to lob into the middle of a bad relationship like a hand grenade, I guess, and blow it all apart.
Want to know what, exactly?
Okay, that's cool, okay.  But the nice time we just had... was it nicer, as nice, or less nice than the nice times you were having a couple of weeks ago?
Money does not matter.  I do not care how much you earn.  I'd just like you to be a little happier in your work, but beyond that you can do what you like.
Yeah, you're alright.  But you're certainly not happy.  So what happens if you get happy?  And yes I know that's the title of an Elvis Costello album, I use the reference deliberately to catch your attention. Should we split up because I'm used to you being miserable?  What happens if you, I don't know, start you're own record label, and it's a success? Time for a new girlfriend?
Just local, of course.
Would you marry me if I was?
I mean, maybe you're right.  But were you really expecting me to say yes?
It's true!
Is Ray going?
Yup.  Not far from here, actually.
The Conformist.
Hi, Rob.  It's your mother.
Well I don't know what happens now, apart from you meet someone, you move in, she goes.  You meet someone, you move in, she goes.
He's in Jamaica with a twenty-three- year-old.  A friend of my daughter's. He had the fucking nerve to call me and ask me to borrow some money and I told him to fuck off, so he asked me to sell his singles collection and send him a check for whatever I go, minus a ten percent commission. Which reminds me.  Can you make sure you give me a five?  I want to frame it and put it on the wall.
That wasn't part of the deal.  I want to be poisonous but fair.
Eleven-hundred.  That's my lowest offer.
And I won't take a penny over ninety.
I can't frisk you but the cops can.
Whatever.
P.D. says 41, but he barely looks 30.
Yeah.
Well, this is a small town, and it was even smaller then.  Most all the babies I delivered were from local families.  Richard's parents were just passing through when his mother's time came.  I did it right here at the house.
The boy _died_?
Mother too.  Sad case it was.  The young lady just couldn't make it through labor.  Never even saw her son.
There was this one fella.  Asked a lot of questions.  I was out of town but I heard he spent near a full day in the records office.
I'd like to ask you about the claymore.
You've been listening to rumors.
At least.
A factor of age.
I've been telling myself it's the award winning journal article I'm going to write.  But it's not.  It's you.
That would be difficult to explain.
You and your buddy make a real team, don't you?  Exchanging eloquent threats in iambic pen- tameter while hacking up all the innocents in between.
There are differences.
I'm just curious.
You better have a warrant.  That's my notebook, you've got no right to be sticking your fingers into it.
Four?
You're an asshole, Moran.
I want Taupin.
Research.  If your pal was there I never saw him.
Yeah.
Some job.  Card filing and cabinet dusting.  Four years in this dump and I haven't written anything for Wilson that a wounded yak couldn't do.
Stop.
Your name is Conor?
Juan Cid Romirez.  Chief surveyor and alchemist.
Please go to no trouble.
Pheasant.
You are still so very young.
This is monstrous.  I'll burn in hell for all eternity.
You'd have to die first.  Aqui.
You recall how I spoke of the push you feel and how I make it less?
And you?
There's rumor in the village. Some call it magic.
I don't know, Conor.  It's not natural.  Maybe something has touched you.
You're sounding like that mad woman, Widow Baggins.
Tradition.
It can be different.  It must be.
Thanks.
Yeah.
No.  I want this to be all ours.
The last four.
We learned he'd found the immigration notaries in Liverpool and traced them to New York.  Then he figured out the birth records in Church Hill...
I've had a few more concerns.
MACLEOD!
Leave her alone.
I want you to come to me.
Give me an address where I can forward Miss Cart- wright's head.
That's none of your business.
I'll give you a hundred and a by- line.
Exactly!
Don't be embarrassed, Bruce. I heard it, but I just wanted to hear it again. I can stand being spoiled a little. The gentleman I'm going to have a chat with did very little spoiling.
He certainly -- hic -- does!
But --
I could get a company doctor in twenty minutes.
For a minute, I thought maybe Walter Burns was at the back of it. But then I realized he couldn't have been.
Bruce, you know I'm mad about you and stop talking like that.  Walter!
Oh -- mother -- she -- I don't know where she went.
No, I was going to give it to her -- but she left hurriedly.
You got it back, eh? There's something funny going on around here.
Oh -- an hour for the interview. Another hour to write it.
Well, I'm independent, too.
And remember this, Bruce! I love her, too.
No, Bruce, you didn't come between us. It was all over for her before you came on the scene. For me -- it'll never be over.
Don't thank me. I should thank you. So long.
What the devil do you want? Listen, Bruce, you can't come in here now! We're busy!  Where you been, Duffy? Stick around! What? What Chinese earthquake? The deuce with it... what's that?
Say, I want to be sure, too!
You'll see nothing of the kind, Sheriff.
This is the Morning Post you're talking to!
You know what. How long since we've seen each other?
Let's see. I was in Reno six weeks -- then Bermuda... Oh, about four months, I guess. Seems like yesterday to me.
Maybe it was yesterday. Been seeing me in your dreams?
I'll always remember it. If I hadn't remembered it, I wouldn't have divorced you.
Divorced me. It sort of makes a fellow lose faith in himself. It almost gives him a feeling he wasn't wanted.
Well, suppose we did? That isn't what I got married for. What's the good of -- Look, Walter, I came up here to tell you that you'll have to stop phoning me a dozen times a day -- sending twenty telegrams -- all the rest of it, because I'm --
That's the first time you've been right today. That's what I --
It would have worked if you'd been satisfied with just being editor and reporter. But no! You had to marry me and spoil everything.
Sweeney.
No!
Keep away --
That's why I'm quitting. I want to go some place where I can be a woman.
Oh sure, it's honest. But somehow, I can't picture you with a guy who sells policies.
Thank you.
I'm an editor. I know what ought to be written, but I can't write it the way you could. It needs a woman's heart --
Oh, nothing! Of course, you might cancel the check. Yes! Wait a minute! What would be his first payment on that policy?
Well, this expert Dr. Egelhoffer, from New York, decides to make Williams re-enact the crime --
Let go o' me! I've got to get Bruce out of jail! Oh, Walter, why did you have to do this to me?
You drooling idiot! What do you mean, you're getting out! There are three hundred and sixty-five days in the year one can get married -- but how many times have you got a murderer locked up in a desk? -- Once in a lifetime! Hildy, you've got the whole city by the seat of the pants!
Don't get technical at a time like this! Do you realize what you've done? You've taken a city that's been graft-ridden for forty years under the same old gang and with this yarn you're kicking 'em out and giving us a chance to have the same kind of government that New York's having under La Guardia! We'll make such monkeys out of these ward-heelers next Tuesday that nobody'll vote for them -- not even their wives!
What tickets?
What am I going to say to Bruce? What'll I tell him?
Yes! What are you afraid of Hildy? I dare him to move that desk out of here.
Uh-uh. As long as we were in there together pitching -- they couldn't lick us. Well, it's been a lot of fun.
Don't remind me. That's how we happened to --
That's all right, Walter. It's as much my fault as yours.
He's going to have you the rest of his life, Hildy. Can't you give me another hour?
All right.  Heads I go -- tails I stay to write the story. Ready?
Don't touch me! I'm not doing it for you!
What do you mean? Bruce'll be waiting for you in Albany.
Sure.
It's awfully clear now. Bruce needs a wife who can give him a home -- and affection -- and peace. I couldn't do that for him, Walter. I'm what you made me -- a cheap reporter who'd give up her soul for a story!... Is that job still open?
Hildy, if that's what you want, all right. We'll even go to -- how about Niagara Falls?
Walter, you can't do that!
Now everything's fine. She's probably squawking her head off in some police station.
Sure, boss.
And that means Earl Williams dies tomorrow morning and makes a sucker out of us!
He's on my phone. He just called me.
They can't do that to me!
It doesn't matter. The publicity's the main thing.
This Egelhoffer's pretty good.
I can't complain.
Little rum in yours, too?
Not this gun!
After all I've done for you --
Twelve dollars! -- For those rheumatic uncles of yours?  Out shooting everybody they see for the fun of it?
But we're going to hang him, Fred. He can't get away.
Now what do you say?
A sight for sore eyes!
It's a frame-up! Some imposter!
So do you what, you hoodoo!  And now, Mr. Pinkus, if you'll come with us, we'll take you over to the Warden's office and deliver this reprieve.
Now, Hildy, don't be hasty! I can't let him out.
Oh, some insurance man. Are you in?
This is Hildy Johnson...  Oh, I can give it up all right. Without a single quiver. I'm going to live like a human being -- not like you rats.  Oh, is that you, Walter dear? Oh, I didn't mean "dear." That was just habit, I guess. Oh, be yourself, Walter. I've got some news for you... Yes, I got the interview, but I've got some news that's more important.
And up a dime.
What's the use of fighting, Hildy?
Four hundred and fifty and I'll cut your throat if you try any tricks!
First you got to sign a receipt. 
Huh?
Well -- I was going, but Mollie fainted away and I thought I ought to do what I could.
No, Earl, not at all.  Who sent you the flowers, Earl?
I won't, Earl. 
Well, maybe you think I could!
It wasn't the Lord! It was the devil!
I'll be right here. I won't leave you.
It's a simple story. Earl Williams works for the E.J. McClosky Manufacturing Company as a bookkeeper for fourteen years. He starts in at twenty dollars a week and gradually works his way up to twenty-two fifty. A year ago the McClosky Company goes out of business and Williams loses his job.  Take it away, Fred Wilson!
We want to see you.
Your grandmother. She named them after virtues I lack. That's marriage for you.
Looking for shrapnel.
I don't mind.
Sod.
We thought it was poison.
...and four and five...
The land and the King are one, my son. If he stutters we falter. He's getting batter, and so are we.
Big Berthas, shelling France. Twenty-five-mile range, they have.
....buried In a shell-hole for thee days, while he's out there playing polo and sticking pigs.
How are we going to cope?
How many of our class left? You and me out of twenty-eight.
Well! I'm not talking about Mac. He hasn't toughed me for ages. And not often ever. My life started when Mac went on nights.
Well, yeah, kind of.
OK.
Is your brother ready to go?
Mmmmm, this is tasty.
What?
You shouldn't a done that.
Ummmm... two hundred and eighty-five dollars.
Hey, wait take this.
Shit, I don't remember exactly. I took over for my Pa just after the Duke nabbed the Oscar.
But if you did.
No, no I think it's really interesting.
Yeah but, she reminds me of this chick that I remember from fourth grade... called a... shit, what did we call her?  Oh yeah, Patty Pee-pee Pants... when ever she got called on by Miss Chumski, this chick would piss in her pants and start bawling.
Shit, we really need to find some gas.
Cat fight, cat fight.
I'll help ya.
Gee, ya think it wouldn't be too much trouble.
And the spare is safely sitting in Jerry's garage.
He won't move.
Screw that, no way, I ain't letting you go by yourself.
Drive through it!
You seen this girl? Say... within the last 24 hours.
Well, yeah... I think that if you knew him... I mean if you'd understand his urges, shit the guy's like forty or something.
Yeah, I guess, you know next to wacking his weasel his other favorite thing is twisting sharpened pencils in the corner of his eyes.
No dear, I'm fine. Now what kind of host would I be if I put my guests to this kind of work.
I don't want to see that.
Oh yeah, murder museum... sounds fun.
So.
Yes, thank you. Thank you very much.
Help, help us.
Let's go. You're the one who wanted to be a photographer.
Aw, shit...  I gotta pee anyway.
Exactly... well, I guess a couple more photos won't kill me.
Never. I swear to God he never sleeps, he goes to bed after me, wakes up before me. He's always working on 10.
Aw Christ, Jerry. We can't see anything now, it's too dark. Let's forget it.
Yep, I found something.
Keys.
Yes, sir.
Maybe. He's a real lady killer.
Huh?
Where's Bill?
Excuse me, I'm sorry for disturbing you this fine afternoon.
What should I do?
My Denise is a smart girl, she wouldn't do anything stupid, and her boyfriend, he always seemed like a good kid.
I ain't got a warrant.
Call Wydell.
Dr. Satan?
Yeah, well I guess it's tough to sit on the sidelines and wait when your own kid's missing... besides, ain't no such thing as an ex-cop.
That is the wrong fork, young man.
Well, don't jump down my throat. I'm just trying to help.
Why, because I'm a freak and you are beautiful, and you are being nice enough to come down to my freak, nonbeautiful level and act concerned about my repulsive troubles?
You're fucked up, Lila.  Why don't you fucking try electrolysis or something? Figure it out for chrissake.
Hey, ma. Did you bring any clothes? I'm freezing my ass off.
Great.  God, I've wanted you forever.
Really? My day? Well, I had a sweet little mongrel puppie named Puff when I was a girl. This one reminds me of my dog, all shaggy! So cute!  I loved my doggie very much, monsieur.
No. I just got distracted. I'm so sorry.
Oui.  Now you've got me talking French.
It's nice, yes. I'm glad I ran into you, both in our silly pajamas. It is two happy coincidences, no?
Thank you so much. Merci. It's very wonderful to hear a man say such a nice compliment.
Shh.
What for?
You heard me! You make me sick when you pretend to not understand what I am saying to you! Go away from here!
God, you're beautiful.
No. You look so beautiful.
That goddamn Neanderthal? I'm the one who gave him the idea for the combination bug spray-sun screen! Did you know that?!
Hunh.
That is horrible. Apes are dirty. No?
It's an animal urge, Puff. It's nothing to be ashamed of.
I don't get that. Is that sexual?
Loves animals. Loves you.
Yeah?
No. I married a midget.
Well he wasn't really a midget. He was on the cusp of midgethood. That's what made it cheap. Had he been an actual midget, there would've been nothing cheap about it, my dear.
Oh?
Stand on a stepladder sometimes.
I'm really glad you two found each other.
I have to say that I'm not there yet.
It's my thesis that if table manners can be taught to mice, they can be taught to humans.
I'm not sure.
Courtesy, decorum, manners, are all sadly lacking from our daily intercourse. Rudeness, vulgarity, meanness are the norm.
Tell her, Harold...  It's just that... It's nothing. It's just that the outside fork is the salad fork. One goes from the outside in as the dinner progresses.
You do?
Yes, and...
You really enjoy my company?
I don't care. I don't care!  Like what, for example?
Yes.
I think he's feral.
He looks perfectly fine.
I don't understand you. This is fascinating and you just want to run away. I mean, here we have a human being totally uncontaminated by civilization, totally free, and all you want to do is run back to your...
What?
Great. Grab his feet. We'll throw him in the trunk.
Good. Making progress.
Yeah. It's nice. It's really good.
Really?
How come?
Oh boy!
Nah. You just relax. How's the book?
That's funny because, you know, I just went and picked him up at some flophouse on the lower eastside. He called here when he ran out of his "mad" money after spending an entire evening drinking, watching strippers, and fucking a whore!  Oh, and what did you do tonight, honey?
Lila, you don't intend to hurt us, do you?
Tomorrow, the acid test.
And because you did so well, we have a little surprise for you.
It would be my pleasure, doctor.  Distinguished gentlemen and ladies of the psychological community, I stand before you today, a living testament to the amazing skill of Dr. Nathan Bronfman. To say that he took me from crayons to perfume would be a vast understatement. Dr. Bronfman took me from playing with my own feces, then to crayons, and then to an appreciation of the complex works of Franz Kline, Joseph Beuys, and Marcel Duchamp. From compulsive masturbation to...
Down from the tree. Both of you. Keep your hands where I can see them. Don't want you pulling any weapons out of your fur.
Let's be reasonable human beings here. We're all reasonable human beings, aren't we?
Look, why don't you and Lila stay here and have your natural life. I'll just go on my way. You'll never see me again.
I saw you on C-Span. I've been looking for you for thirty years. Then there you were, such a beautiful, beautiful grown man.
I'm an ape, mom. I'm an ape. And apes don't drop lines.
You, uh, you ever been to Louisville during Derby week, Miss, ah, Packard?
Lots of action. Lots of money.  Lots of class. You'll see some of the best-dressed and most beautiful women in the world at the races. Knock your eye out.
Soon as I finish my coffee.
That's right, Miss Packard.
And a fact is a fact.
For what makes the world go round. For money, and for glory.
Well, nobody has to sell.
Deal the cards.
Do you really think you can beat him?
Of course he thinks he can beat me, Bert. He wouldn't be playing me if he didn't. Right, Felson?
Two.
Only when I work.
Yeah? Why?
You being cute?
No, three thousand at least. He'll start you off at five hundred a game -- he'll beat the pants off you. That's the way he plays when he comes up against a man who knows the way the game is. He'll beat you flat four or five games -- maybe more, depending on how, uh... steady your nerves are. But he might -- he just might be a little scared of you, and that could change things. But I wouldn't count on it.
I told you. I got drunk.
Thanks for the drink.
I'm already rich. But I like action. That's one thing I think you're good for is action. Besides, like I say... you got talent.
Where do I sign?
Miss Packard. How do you do?
No, no. When you play for me, I pick up all the tabs.
I don't know.
I know when to quit. You don't. Win or lose, you don't know when to quit.
Half.
Who's he?
Okay, I'm Eddie Felson. I shoot straight pool. You got any straight pool shooters in this here poolroom?
Come up here to play straight pool with Minnesota Fats?
Yeah, that's right.
Want some free advice?
Oh, come on, stop stalling. Grab yourself a cue.
Why?
Eleven thousand four hundred, cash. Here in my pocket.
Now wait a minute. You're coming with me. You're gonna eat breakfast at the hotel. Pool game is over.
You can't see it, can you, Charlie? I mean, you've never been able to see it. I came after him. And I'm gonna get him. I'm goin' with him all the way. The pool game is not over until Minnesota Fats says it's over. Is it over, Fats?
Well, maybe that's it. I'm chicken.
Go on home. Just leave me the money.
Okay, here...  Be a damn fool.
Don't worry about it. I'll raise the money.
What for? To play Fats again?
You wanna come back on the road with me, okay, the money's yours. But if you wanna give it to Minnesota Fats... nothing doing. What do you say?
Is that what you think?
All right. That's what I want. Poolroom with a little handbook on the side. Getting old.
I'm having some people over for drinks right after the races. Why don't you all come over? Then about nine, ten o'clock we can play.
For who, Mr. Findley? ...Bert, he only beat me by one point. Now, you can't get off me now.
Yeah. Sure.
Hey, I'll tell you what -- I'll play you jack-up pool -- just keep one hand in my pocket.
Half and a dollar.
How much are you ahead?
Couple of bucks.
Call it.
Fine, thanks.
You don't look like a college girl.
No. No more. I'm getting sleepy.  Thank you very much, Mr...?
No, c'mon, I wanna know. I wanna keep score.
Yeah. I met this guy -- Gordon, Bert Gordon. He said I was. Born loser.
Is he a winner?
Well, he owns things.
Well, what else does?
Two.  Sherry?... Nice joint. You look very pretty.
A week? A year?
Sure. Let's go home.
I got no idea of love. And neither have you. I mean, neither one of us would know what it was if we saw it coming down the street.
Well, that old lovin' horse paid twenty-two forty.  Let's see... two hundred I won from the jockey last night. And today at the track... I got five hundred and forty bucks.  Here, you hold it.
Well, what's the matter?
You're, uh, you're Minnesota Fats, aren't you? You know, uh, they say Minnesota Fats is the best in the country out where I come from.
Big John! You think this boy is a hustler?
Nine ball.  Three ball.
That's what the game's all about.
Game's over, Eddie.
That's good, Eddie. For how much?
It comes back.  Flashes.  My name.
Yes.
You're not them.
Have you looked inside?
Before... when I was one of them. I would look at this and it was just strangers.  Now I... remember.
Yes.
Shhh... don't talk.
I surrender --
Round back.
You'll meet new friends.  I know ... it's rough.  But I have to move, son.
Let's see what's on the other side. Maybe we'll find some copper.
And that one -- to the right of Rigel?
It was -- it was -- it changed shape. First it was big and round, then it was flat, then it was long and thin.
I don't know, Dad.  But it was big.
What, Jim, what?
I'll take you to school.
You did?  Why? Where were you? They said you left hours ago. We were worried.
Yes -- but ...
George, you're acting very strangely.
It's his nightmare.  He still hasn't gotten over it ... about the other side of the hill.
Of course.
No.
Hide the car.
I'm not.  They must be tunneling under the whole town.
What kind, Mom?
Gardner?  Oh, um -- he's a new student. Just moved here.  Why?
Jimmy's father is on the phone.  I wonder if you'd take the call.
I take it you've heard.
Then get them out of there.
Please, would I be this panicked if it was that simple?
Dad, don't start.
Three, four. Move on. It's not healthy.
You still got the Olds?
She always keeps her portable phone listed, for emergencies. Sometimes it's just her first initial, sometime her nickname...
College nickname.
David, you're drunk.
What'd I say?
Oh shit, we're late.
Great.
I can't shake her free.
It's not me. They're overriding the system.
Doesn't matter. Game's over.
And get those helicopters away from the ship. Call them back immediately.
The helicopter never arrived at Nellis and there's been no radio contact.
Better than we thought.
That's not your call to make, Mr. Nimziki.
My God, the Vice President and the Joint Chiefs...
Please, you're not buying into any of this nonsense, are you? We don't have the manpower or the resources to launch that kind of a campaign.  Not to mention that this whole cockamamie plan is dependent on a machine that no one in the world is qualified to operate.
It's doing what?
Butt-munch.
Butt-munch.
I'm a dancer.
Just take it, dick head.  Alicia! Make sure he takes his medicine.
You sure?
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
Just fell asleep. He's gonna be just fine. Join me in a little celebration?
We're leaving.
And before here?
There is no museum in Iskenderun.
The search for the Cup of Christ is the search for the divine in all of us.
I'll tell him we'll take two.
I don't know. Maybe he'll know us.
But don't you see? The pen is mightier than the sword.
No, Henry. Try not to talk.
Oh, well. That's good. Thank you.
This is a castle. And we have many tapestries. But if you're a Scottish lord, then I am Mickey Mouse.
Just the same, an attempt to recover the Grail is currently underway.
That's usually when the ground falls out from underneath your feet.
Yes?
Yes?
Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades.
The Christians would have dug their own passages and burial chambers centuries later.
Pretty sure.
He never would have made it past the rats! He hates rats! He's scared to death of them!
What?
No. You like the way I do things.
Yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the Grail stands for -- who gives a damn what you think?
It's ours, Indy. Yours and mine.
No, Dad. You listen to me --
Junior!
He was actually there? You saw him?
Yeah, big ones. What do the Nazis want with you Dad?
Take it easy?! Why do you think I sent it home in the first place?  So it wouldn't fall into their hands!!
Oh yeah? And who's gonna come to save you, Junior??
Are you kidding? -- I made that up! You know Marcus -- he got lost once in his own museum!
My lucky charm.
What???
...the solution presents itself.
My Diary's in Berlin.
All right Dad -- tell me.
I don't know. The first available flight out of Germany.
Good.
Relax.
We didn't talk. We never talked.
What you taught me was that I was less important to you than people who had been dead for five hundred years in another country. And I learned it so well that we've hardly spoken for twenty years.
Dad, how can you?
Get out of there, Dad!
Penitent. Penitent...
Ah, they set out across the desert this afternoon. I believe they took Mister Brody with them.
No.
If you don't let go, Doctor Jones, we'll both die.
My soul is prepared. How's yours?
My name is Kazim.
In that case, God be with you in your quest. Your father is being held in the Castle of Brunwald on the Austrian-German border.
You think so?
Even if they were trying to scare us away, a devout Hindu would never touch meat.  Makes you wonder what these people are...
You should have been there...
No? Well, I guess he just hasn't met the right woman...
The newspapers exaggerated the incident.
Nee chin lie how ma?
Just a statue.
Next time I flatten him! Did you see his eyes?
Indy, they glow like fire and get real crazy! Then he talk in this real scary voice!
"Follow in the footsteps of Shiva. Do not betray his truth."
What?
What evil?
He said that's whey they were at river -- they were waiting for the plane to fall down.
A snake!
What?!
Just one arm!
Oh really?
Maybe...
He said he couldn't take us any farther. He has to go sell the elephants.
Wearing your jewels to bed, princess?
Willie, open the door! GET US OUT OF HERE!
Willie!
I'm going down.
You're gonna get killed chasing after your damn fortune and glory!
They think I'm insane. Tell them I'm not, Indy. Please -- help me ...
Figures...
Why not.
Who was it?
This candid camera?
I'm working on it. Soon as I find the right nerve bundle.
Who am I?
The Nicholson Node. I suppose you haven't heard of that either.
Yes...Yes...I'll explain it all. Just put the gun down.
No one. Maybe I dreamed it all up.
Still clear. Just a motorcycle.
You have no choice, you're involved. Will you help?
I did. I brought you back here.
I'm not leaving until you do.
See the codelock? Punch this in. 26993
I can't remember..
Black suits and helmets.
Gone where?
You do. To get out of here. You're gonna be me.
Just scratched my arm, why?
Send a man there. A secret agent.
Who cares?
Well, if not to kill, then to bother and annoy.
Nothing, but it's yours. Change it. Change your whole persona.
How else do you get seaweed under your nails?
I don't want to eat it.
A girl.
How should I know?
.
...Rene...
To the hotel. To register.
Well you did it today.
Looks like...the optic nerve. I can see out!
You want sophistication, it don't come cheap.
Are you serious?
Killer!
Don't get too cute.
Voice stress analyzer.
What if she says something important?
What she say. What'd you get out of her?
It's not your time. I get time off.
I...I'll got to the movies. That's what I'll do!
I'm running in circles in the middle of some foreign country. I don't speak their language, they don't speak mine. I don't even know where I am. What's going to present itse........
Just stay here and rest.
A hard left. A hard left.
I can't see a thing.
No. You can't trust her.
Then why let her out of our sight? Besides, she's all we've got...
I can't handle that thing.
Just fine. I'll do the driving from now on.
You were the one who was always suspicious of her!
Thing is...I think I'm in love with her.
I'll get us out of here.
Aren't we all.
It'll remind me of you.
Dieter?
Then what?
Joe's escaped. Dieter's in him.
We don't even know where to start. What about these people? What do we do with them?
It's just money.
Enough ROmance.
What things?
No, it wasn't, It was intentional.
Who?
Yes?
Where?
Haven't seen you around.
Disinterest?
He likes the quiet. They were here last week.
No, he didn't do that.
Food doesn't agree with me.
This business is over.
Now, so am I...What's so interesting about him?
Oh sure.
Who was?
Why don't you get us some food. This may take some time.
Get us one.
Hong Kong.
What?
Oh.
What'd...you forget?
What did you tell them?
What?
We just don't stop.
It was you.
Water fountain's through that door, down the hall.
You can't take that.
It is?
Instant rice...?
Mom.
Three hours.
P.J.'s.
And it's bullshit. And if I'm right, are you going to put the Journal's reputation behind a story that's going to blow up in your face?
Okay.
Sure.
CBS does not do that. And, you're questioning our journalistic integrity?!
What does it look like I'm doing? I'm editing.
That's happening. And, hopefully we won't have to use the alternate, but we should have it in the can.
I'm not implying. I'm quoting. More vested interests...  "Persons Who Will Profit From This Merger...  Ms. Helen Caperelli, General Counsel of CBS News, 3.9 million. Mr. Eric Kluster, President of CBS News, 1.4 million..."
If we could take a look, Mr. Wigand...
Yes, I do. A .38 Target Master. In my gun safe downstairs. A .45 Gold Cup. A .22 target pistol. So what?
"Mike?"
I'm told unusual promises were made to Wigand.
Hey, listen, I hear you guys are sitting on something sensational over there.
Oh, c'mon, Lowell. This is The New York Times. I don't know...
Did I tell you you were wrong?
Yes, it's on the stove...
Why did you take your stuff from the office?
I have to take a shower.
What?!
No. No, it's okay... How's -- how's the new place?
It would be better if he called us.
Alright?
Good.
Give me a break!
In the real world, when you get to where I am, there are other considerations...
Like what? Corporate responsibility? What, are we talking celebrity here?
Everything interests me.
Just so I know you know, when I talk to people in confidence, it stays that way.
If you want to do it.
It happened after I talked to you. I do not like coincidences!
And I don't like paranoid accusations! I'm a journalist. Think. Use your head. How do I operate as a journalist by screwing the people who could provide me with information before they provided me with it?
Like what?
I don't know... you think the Knicks are gonna make it through the semi- finals?
Okay, so, here you are... you go to work for tobacco.  You come from corporate cultures where research, really, creative thinking, these are core values. You go to tobacco... Tobacco is a sales culture. Market and sell enormous volume. Go to a lot of golf tournaments. The hell with everything else.  What are you doing? Why are you working for "tobacco" in the first place?
I can't talk about it. The work I was supposed to do... might have had some positive effect. I don't know... it could have been beneficial.  Mostly, I got paid a lot. I took the money. My wife was happy. My kids had good medical. Good schools. Got a great house.  I mean, what the hell is wrong with that...?
My father? What the hell's that got to do with my father?
...to a network, probably, we're all commodities.  To me? You are not a commodity. What you are is important.
Are you talking to me or did somebody else just walk in here?! I never abandoned a source!
I'll call them, Lowell.
She sued you for back payments of child support?
What kind of shit is this? I was not on the team, I sparred with the Olympic Team... okay?
Hello, can you hear me now?
Most certainly.
It acts as a...
My co-counsel, Ron Motley, and I have filed a lawsuit against the tobacco industry on behalf of the State of Mississippi to get the state reimbursed Medicaid costs for treating people with smoking-related illness.  If you'd be interested in talking to us, we'd certainly like to talk to you...
Shut up. I was a lawyer. Just like you. And my clients? Whores just like you.
Grounds?
So. I won't be seeing her? Your clients usually visit me after the settlement.
Not this one. Not unless her HMO covers plastic surgery, which, incidentally, she does not need.
It's a LeCoultre Revers. You can flip the face, and set it for two time zones.
I was going to play golf. You were going to have Asian girlfriends.
Doyle Oil?  A Massey Pre-nup?  She loves him.
That was Marvin Untermeyer.
You like kids.
Why do you think she did it?
It's about time.
Not according to Mrs. Rabinow.
Not yet.
No.
No. I haven't. Have you?
He wants a reconciliation.
Gotcha.
Absolutely.
A little.  You get out of the car. That's right, Fuctard. I'm talkin' to you!
From a -- girlfriend.
Did you just propose to me?
Yes. I am. What else could those words mean? I believe we belong together and we can make one another happy. And we should be happy because happiness is better than the alternative which is -- just jump in any old time, Marylin. You have more experience at this than I do.
No.
No ma'am. I have been asleep all my life up to this moment. Marylin, will you marry me?
Fabric and fringe.
I don't know. Maybe I should grab my mace. I'm a civil attorney. I have little experience with "the criminal mind."
What kind of "stuff?"
Salary. Unreported income.  By the way, what time IS it on Bellagio Road?
Meaning my house.
I believe the residence will be part of the settlement.
Please! Leave the house.
But then -- I guess -- something inside me died when I realized that you'd hired a goon to kill me.
Forgery? Fraud?
Fine. They were created during a dictatorship.  What if something happened to you? What would I tell little Gus when he asked "what was my daddy like?"
But Marylin, you know a divorce would ruin me right now. Everything I have -- everything we have -- is tied up in my business. The business is my entire life.
Marylin?
Dogs?
Sometimes I forget.
Please!
He was right, wasn't he?
Neither did I until my lawyer found it -- quite a paper trail -- he had it in the dog's name.
Do you know him?
I'm dying.
I guess.
Sam is Sam. He's taking up fly fishing. He's in a yert in Montana.
At this point my client is still prepared to consider reconciliation.
Why not a hundred and fifty percent?
Rephrase. Mrs. Rexroth, have you ever been in love?
...why did she do it, Ruth? Why?
Rex, please.
That's her job. You have to respect that.
Mm.
So, you propose that in spite of demonstrable infidelity on your part, your unoffending wife should be tossed out on her ear?
And she had private investigators assisting her.
And she has...?
I am very sorry.
No. You're not.
Spoons! Honestly Wrigley, I'm surprised at you. What is this? Some Martha Stewart suggestion? Those are the most cockamamie things I've ever --
...and I hear she's richer than Croesus.
I know you would, Wrigley. But would Kramer?
No. Uh uh. I don't think so. Hmm? No. Well... no.
Oh, no, sir. No different thanâ€
Yeah.
Please understand me. When I say she didn't tell me anything about it, I mean not until a little while ago. She thinks you're entitled to anything you can get.
Oh, she does, huh? Isn't that sweet of her! You don't , I suppose.
You're a peculiar chap.
We'll go into that some other time.
She grabbed herself a perfect running mate. King Westley! The pill of the century!  What she needs is a guy that'd take a sock at her every dayâ€”whether it's coming to her or not.
All right! Put me in chains! Do anything you want!  But I'm not going to eat a thing until you let me off this boat!
He's no good, Ellie, and you know it. You married him only because I told you not to.
I won't thank you! I'll never thank you!
Please don't shout.
Oh, yes. I heard.
Sorry, Dad. I wouldn't hurt you for the world. You know that.
Who is he?
But that's silly, child. Seeing how you feel, whyâ€
It doesn't matter.  I don't want to stir up any more trouble. I've been doing it all my life. I've been such a burden to youâ€”made your life so miserableâ€”and mine, too. I'm tired, Dad. Tired of running around in circles. He's right, that's what I've been doing ever since I can remember.
Why, no . . . Don't be silly.
I'm sorry you read it.
Certainly!  Pay him off. He's entitled to it. He did an excellent job. Kept me thoroughly entertained. It's worth every penny he gets.
Of course I mean it! I don't care whom she's married toâ€  â€”as long as I can get her back. 
Absurd!  All this fuss over a snip of a girl.  I'm going down to see her myself.
Yes, sir.
Oh, I see, young people in love are never hungry.
Just between you and me, I never intended taking it off.
Huh?
Fresh guy, huh! What you need is a good sock on the nose.
Oh, yeah?
You win!
Driver!
Yes. Tell that man to drive slowly.
Seems to me I've already thanked you for that.  What time is the next bus to New York?
I found it on the seat.
What for?
If you play your cards right, you might get some money out of it. 
Are you talking to me!
Oh, you did? What am I expected to doâ€”leap for joy?
Your ego is colossal.
Yeah. Yeah, not bad. How's your's?
Oh, this?â€”I like privacy when I retire. I'm very delicate in that respect. Prying eyes annoy me.  Behold the walls of Jericho![4] Maybe not as thick as the ones that Joshua blew down with his trumpet, but a lot safer. You see, I have no trumpet.  Now just to show you my heart's in the right place, I'll give you my best pair of pajamas.
Yeah. I got a name. Peter Warne.
Peter Warne? I don't like it.
Like what?
Like this. I have no robe.
Hereâ€”take mine.
Thank you.  My, my! Scrambled eggs.
Nope. No complaints.
Yeah?
Kingâ€”King Westley was in it.
Oh. Is that how you met him?
Thanks, professor.
You don't have to lose your temper!  That's what you told me the last time too. Every time I step in to protect you. At the Elk's dance[7] when that big Swede made a pass at youâ€
I'm sorry I didn't take another sock at him.
I did! It was my idea, wasn't it?
I was never built for these moonlight strolls.  Why did we have to leave the bus?
Not as long as I'm alive.
To New York?
Yes.
To be a "piggy-backer" it takes complete relaxationâ€”a warm heartâ€”and a loving nature.
Not a one.
knowâ€”butâ€
But what!
Hitch-hiking.
You! Don't make me laugh.
Why didn't you take all your clothes off? You could have stopped forty cars.
Come on! come on! 
Yeah. He finally agreed to let us have a room.
Talked him out of it. He thinks we're going to stay a week. I'll have to think of something before morning.
That's swell!
You bet I did.
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.  Here.
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
No, he ain't! And the car's gone, too.
Seems to me you're doing excellently without any assistance. 
Get out!
Yes?
The dame's too smart for him.
You mean about the Andrews' kid?
Who's she gonna marry?
Who's the guy she's gonna marry?
Okay, pete. 
Yeah.
It's a lotta dough. If I was to run across that dame, you know what I'd do?
What's on your mind?
Five G'sâ€”or I crab the works.
Say listen, when you're talkin' to old man Shapeley, you're talking toâ€
Got a couple of kids, huh?
You love them, don't you?
When you're in a war, boss, you use every weapon you got.
They put the heat on, my man, just like you're doing.  I gave'em anything that popped into my cabeza.  Truth is, I never met the dude.
You can't ever say crime don't pay in Louisiana, Jim - only not as good as it used to.  Good chowder, ain't it?
Swishes.  They swish, y'know.  Young fags, you know.  They'd come into my bureau needing help, no bread, and I'd say, hey man, I ain't Rockefeller, who gonna back you up?  These cornmuffins go to the phone and dial...
Bullshit!  Bartender, another round...  Here's to the New Frontier.  Camelot in smithereens.  I'll drink to that.
You, Numa?
You're not digging.
I told your uncle I never met a lawman who wasn't a punk.  You too, Bill, even if you're family.  He's a big shot businessman.  I seen him on the TV news a lot with all the other big shots.  A fag, you know.  Goes by another name down here.
What's the other name?
So why does he call himself Bertrand?
No, you're awake, Bill, and I'm dead serious.  And we're going to start by tracking down your anonymous source from three years ago.  How did you find out Dave Ferrie drove to Texas that day?
The murder of a President, Bill, is a crime in Orleans Parish too.  I didn't pick you because of your legal skill, you know.
Well, they offered you the carrot, and you turned it down... you know what's coming next, don't you, boss?
Where you going, boss?
Maybe 'cause there's some rogue element in the Government!
Well, you see, I've been subject to hypnosis and psychological warfare ever since 1948, when I was in Korea...
No, I did not.
Dave, just calm down.  Meet me in the lobby of the Fontainbleau in 20 minutes.  I'll have a suite reserved for you under an assumed name.
I don't know who to trust anymore. Yeah, sure I could use a pot of hot coffee and a few packs of Camels. You got anything new in the investigation?
I was told that the family wanted examination of the head.
There were admirals.
Sure it is.  Freckle Face, if I ever handled a minor felon like that, it'd be all over the papers.  I'd catch hell.  And this is the alleged murderer of the President?
No, you don't!
I realize you're under a great deal of stress .. it's clouded your judgement.
How many shots you say you heard?
No, I saw a guy shooting from over there.  He was behind that fence. What are you going to do about it?
Presumably so he can now exercise his intellect stacking school texts at $1.25 an hour.
I would imagine a uniformed waiter helps.
Does the name Clay Bertrand mean anything to you?
No, it was not.  Do you know an attorney by the name of Dean Andrews?
I don't know what to say except I'm sorry.  I just don't have rabbits on my mind.
It's not funny, Jim, I'm scared.
A man just called.  He asked her everything!
Is it such a chore?  I don't understand you.
Oh, I don't know anymore!  I believe there was a conspiracy, but not the government.  I just want to raise our children and live a normal life! I want my life back!
He won... and they killed Robert Kennedy.  They shot him down.
Fuck, yeah!  I told you so.  And you can tell'em all I told you so.
Boss, the President's been shot.  In Dallas.  Five minutes ago.
Let's get outta here, Lou.  I saw too much stuff like this in the war.
There was Rose Cheramie.  A whore. Two Cubans threw her out of a car on the way to Dallas.
Graveyard dead near Big Sandy, Texas in '65.  Two in the morning on some highway.  A hit and run.
Unless he or someone else wants him to get caught.  Maybe he never ordered the weapon, Lou.  Somebody else did. It was picked up at the post office early morning when Oswald's time sheet shows him clocked in at his job.  Lou, come alive.  These things are not adding up.
I know you do, Lou.  I'm doing three more lectures this month.  You're all doing an incredible job, Sue, Al, Numa.  But this is one where if you don't nail the other guy, you're dead.  How did Jack Ruby dies so quick?  Of what?  Cancer, right?  A history of Nazi Germany, Lou.  They were studying viral cancers as a weapon in the 30's.  We learned a lot more than you think from the Nazis.  Read this. Our biological warfare lab is in Fort Detrick, Maryland.  Close to where the National Cancer Institute is located.  Think about it.  Think the unthinkable - question everything.
I'd say the opposite - hypertension.
Why not just shoot Kennedy coming up Houston?  There's plenty of time - he's out in the open - a frontal shot?
General Charles Cabell.  Deputy Director of the CIA.  Fired by Kennedy in '61 because of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, he moved back to the Pentagon, called Kennedy a "traitor".  When he came to New Orleans to address the Foreign Policy Association, you know who introduced him?  Our friend Clay Shaw.
You sure got it.  You're one stubborn and stupid sonofabitch D.A. and you're making one hell of a mistake!
Well, I just hope it was worth my while, Mr...
But you don't have a choice anymore. You've become a significant threat to the national security structure. They would've killed you already, but you got a lot of light on you. Instead, they're gonna destroy your credibility; they already have in many circles in this town.  You're some kinda ego-crazed southern caricature to many folks.  Be honest - the best chance you got is come up with a case, something, anything, make arrests, stir the shitstorm. You gotta hope to reach a point of critical mass where other people will come forward and the government will crack.  Remember, fundamentally people are suckers for the truth, and the truth is on your side, 'bubba. I hope you get a break...
You didn't get that break you needed, but you went as far as any man could, bubba.  What can I do for you?
I don't know if I should talk about this.
Often?  He practically lived there. It was real cloak and dagger stuff. They called it Operation Mongoose. The idea was to train all these Cuban exiles for another invasion of Cuba. Banister's office was part of a supply line that ran from Dallas, through New Orleans to Miami, stockpiling arms and explosives.
Anything more specific, Jack?  It's important.
Then what are we going through all this trouble for?
We can use all the support we can get.  I think these might interest you.
Yes?
I need some information from you then.  How old are you?
Uh huh.
But if I am eliminated there won't be any way of knowing.  Consequently a whole new form of government is going to take over this country, and I know I won't live to see you another time.  My life is in danger here. Do I sound screwy?
You were there for me.
How old is that machine gun shit?
What?
Why the fuck you at home? Cause I spent ten thousand dollars gittin' your ass home.  Look, I gotta problem. I need help, and you can help me.
Look, man, I know I owe you --
I wanna help you, but I don't wanna be locked in the trunk of no car.
In his inside coat pocket.
How'd you know where he was?
I found out.
Hey, Jackie.
Sure.
I'm not saying another word.
'Course I do -- I deliver money for him.
That doesn't sound dark.
Great.
That's why I don't quit. If I can't fly anymore, I'm gonna have a bitch of a time gettin' my brand.
I wrote him on Monday. They found him dead on Tuesday.
No, you didn't. What branch?
Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.
How many trips did you make?
Cash poor?
Well, Jackie, you got caught, you're gonna have to give 'em something.
Are you?
We talked.
Why?
It's not really something I think about.
What'd ya see?
How was it?
Yeah, she's the girl who drove the bus in "Speed." She's cute.
Has Nicolet told you any colorful stories like that?
What? If I was in Nicolet's place?
Wait a minute. After we were together you went and snuck into a guy's house?
All he needed was a reasonable explanation.
Well, you know I'm not going to show him the whole amount. He'll see fifty thousand.
Where's the rest of it?
People talk to Winston. He's street, same as them, they trust him. They get busted, they know somebody who can bond them out. I thought I might drop in on him. He'll no doubt be surprised to see me.
He's liable to shoot you.
Everybody wants him, he's a homicide suspect. It doesn't matter who brings him in, he's gonna name you as an accessory.
Ordell called and wants to meet me and I'm scared.
Well, we don't let that happen, now do we?
We're partners.
I'm just tired in general.
Are you scared of me?
I beg your pardon?
You know what's in the bag you're taking?
I need permission to leave the country so I keep my job.
He sells guns.
We've been following Mr. Gara, and he's definitely working for Ordell.
And splittin' with her?
What did you say?
I smiled and walked away. She also told me Ordell killed Beaumont.
Oh, that's taken care of. I called the State Attorney's Office. You were no-filed this morning in Circuit Court.
I was told ten thousand in each pack.
Uh-huh.
I got there early. I've had my eye on this suit -- Wait, let's start over. I got there early. The idea was to try on the suit, see if I liked it. If I did, get them to wrap it up, and change back into my uniform. That's what Sheronda's expecting me to wear. Go meet Sheronda, give her the bag with fifty thousand, and go home.
There was a guy with Melanie?
We were, and we lost him. He walked into a strip bar sometime around three thirty and never came out. The bar was on Ninth, less than a mile- and-a-half from where Louis was found dead. It looks like Louis's friend shot him twice at point blank range.
This time? Almost a year. I've known him forever.
That coke was yours, wasn't it?
Dreaming.
You know how easy it would be? He won't be anywhere near that mall. Pull one more switch, up front. That's it. Half-a-million dollars. Need help?
Got some o.j.?
I said I wanted to talk to a lawyer.
Way I see it, me and you only got one thing to talk about. What you willing to do for me?
They already know it's you.
Look, the only way I can get permission to fly is if I agree to help them. Which is what I have to appear to be doing. So I give them something they already know. You.
They know I'm delivering for you. I mention the half-million -- they don't give a fuck about that -- They want you with guns. So I say, well, if you want proof he's getting paid for selling them, let me bring the money in.
That's a good idea.
If you just listen, you'll see it's a damn good idea. The first time I do it they're lurking about. They see me hand the ten thousand to someone.
But you don't?
Uh-huh.
It washes off. I tell them we're doing it the same way as before. They'll follow Sheronda. I hate the idea of leaving her for a fall.
She saw you with Sheronda. So Simone goes to the dress department with her Robinson's/May bag.
How long?
Four years?
Bank robbery.
Yeah, there's another hit left.
Were you a disco girl?
About five years ago.
I wouldn't go so far as to say that.
So what are you trying to tell me? I should get out of here?
He went to meet that stewardess.
Does that bother you?
Uh-huh?
Watch it, dipshit. You wanna rip the fuckin' bag?
Gimme that bag before I knock you out and take it.
What do I do?
The moon -- I dunno
He put himself in a situation where he was gonna have to do ten years in the penetentiary, that's what he did.  And if you know Beaumont, you know there ain't no way in hell he can do no ten years. And if you know that, you know Beaumont's gonna go any goddam thing Beaumont can to keep from doin' those ten years including telling the Federal government everything they want to know about my ass. Now that, my friend, is a clear case of him or me. And you best believe it ain't gonna be me. You know what I'm sayin'? You gonna come in on this with me, you gotta be prepared to go all the way. I got me so far over a half-a-million dollars sittin' in lockboxes in a bank in Cabo San Lucas. Me and Mr. Walker make us one more delivery, I'm gonna have me over a million. You think I'm gonna let this little cheese eatin' nigga here fuck that up? Shit, you better think again. 'Fore I let this deal get fucked up, I'll shoot that nigga in the head, and ten niggas look just like em.  Understand what I'm sayin'?
So we on the same page then?
What's your relationship?
Yep.
That's what I got to talk to you about. You see, Melanie was giving me a hard time --
Uh-huh.
How much it there?
Maybe a minute. She came right out.
Louis, You tellin' me the truth?
Look, I swear to fucking god, she came out with that bag and I took it from her.
Then what?
Maybe the Feds got it.
Cops can't locate him, huh?
Fella named Beaumont. They have him up at county. It started out drunk driving, but they wrote it up "possession of a concealed weapon." Dumb monkey-ass had a pistol on him.
Beaumont. That's the only name I know.
House or apartment?
What does she do for you?
That's what the police thought. I told them I'm unemployed, how could I have anybody work for me? Now I bail out Jackie, I'm liable to have the police on me again, huh? Wanting to know was she doing things for me, was she bringing me that money!
Was she?
Falsely accused? She didn't come back from Mexico with cocaine on her?
How'd you find me?
That's what Winston does. He finds people who don't want to be found.
And you did that to protect my interest?
It's in the safe. She can't get at it.
She's all alone.
She will.
Turn left.
Uh-huh.
Now, is there anything you want to tell me before we get out of this car?
I was gonna tell you...
Take me home.
Just to see you. That's all.
Yeah, ever since that ...
Daddy. Let go.
It's short, huh?
Don't go.
Exactly. And we need someone to cut through it. We hear you're the man.
I am.
That was set. I'm tellin' you.
Who?
Sarah.
I can't relax.
Ah. Neither snow nor sleet, nor dark of night ... I always admired that.
I haven't seen her in months.
Hmm. I don't suppose there are too many philosophers in the post office?
Oh, that goes way back. They had a hiring freeze, one of those last min- ute things. Bad timing for me though. Middle of the war. The draft.  I'll tell you Prof, after Viet Nam ... I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was just too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
Jacob, if it was any other brain but yours, I might agree.  Tell me, does your lady friend know what a brilliant thinker, what a sub- lime intellect she's living with?
Demons, Jacob? Why demons? Are you writing ... ?
I'm afraid, Prof. Nothing makes sense.  Please help me.
Jacob Singer.
She had these real beefy thighs. Delicious.
Save me!
Why didn't you turn on the light?
Where is the lamp?
They're weird names.
They're Biblical. They were prophets.
And where do you think Jezebel comes from?
A good lay.
I must have been out of my head.
Jake, you are never out of your head!
Not to me.
It has nothin' to do with talkin'.
Oh, come on. It's early.
In a way. At least now I have some idea of what was happening. If we can only get them to admit ... to explain what they did ... I don't know. Maybe it'd clear things up in my head. I'll tell you something, Jez, honestly ... I thought they were real.
What? What do you mean?
I don't believe this.
A chemist. Part of a chemical warfare unit out of Saigon. He said he knows me and that I'll know him when I see him.
I tell you, it was so wonderful. I felt like a little boy. I saw Paradise, Jezzie.
Stick with me, kid.
You're out of your fucking mind. I'm not gonna stand around here gettin' interrogated by you.
I'm tired.
You look terrible. What happened?  Jake ... is it the antidote?
I picked up my ticket.  I'm leaving in the morning, Jez.
Do what? I haven't done a thing.
Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
You know who I am.
I'd hoped I'd never have to. Just open your mouth and stick out your tongue.
Just relax.
Help me!
Lennox Hospital.
You look awake to me. Here.  Drink some of this.
Paul Gruneger! Well I'll be goddamned!
A long time.
That black car?
They're waitin' for me, that's why.
I don't know. I don't know.
Died?
Bring it in.
Is he all right?
On top of him?
You got lucky.
Yeah yeah I better call the labs, see what the hell is going on.
Why wouldn't we be. I mean, look around. So far so good.
Somebody's gonna have to go back to the engine room.
Briggs, Geko, movement beyond the boxed fuselage.
Where'd you get the gun?
Rizzo! Can you hear me?!
I'm coming, I'm coming.
Bring 'em all. Let's move!
Give it a rest Yllo. She needs some time.
Damnit! You scared the hell out of me!
Jason. He's what happened. Then Grendel hit Space Lab.
Guys!!! The shuttle?
Yeah, that's it, scare the hell out of here, that'll work.
I guessed.
It's better this way. If we were rescued Jason would just get off the ship. You want him on your precious Earth II?
It's the engine, reactors, audiometers, it's the stuff that makes the ship go zoom.
Wait around on your asses all day.  I'll need a distraction.
You're doing fine. I won't let anything happen to you, remember?
Did you like it?
I think so, why?
We wait. I need about fifteen. Call me if there are any changes. If she farts I want a full report.
Again?! Jesus!
Kay-Em, you've saved our lives, you know that don't you?
Alright, relax. 20 minutes. Soon as we've passed Tara's rings we'll make the course correction.
You're leaving me here alone?
Are there any other shuttles?
Blew half his skull away, one leg, one arm and left his entrails stretched across the lab. And look at me! I'm covered in his filthy blood!
Ow!
I love you.
Now wait a minute! I don't think you should open that door.
This is a science excursion corporal. Just stay out of the way.
Then open the doors!
Nano...but nanotechnology is impossible.
But...I...400 years?
Impossible! He was dead before he entered Cryo-statis. There is no possible way he could be alive.
Get him out of there!
That's great. I bet they'll kick Jason's ass at a spelling bee!
It's okay.
On the swing? I told you not to play near there until I sanded it down.  See what your son did?
You got it.
No! No! No!  Swing around! After him!
In Amity, you say 'Yahd.' 
I think they make you look sexy.
I don't want to depend on these things, y'know -â€ sometimes you can weaken your eyes.
Hey Chief. Bring my cup back.
Michael! Come inside!
Excuse me, but what are you talking about? Didn't they catch the shark this afternoon? It was on the Cape station news.
I'll see you back soon. There's an extra pair of glasses in your black socks, and there's some suntan lotion and blistex in your kit.
Tell 'em I went fishin'!
I was only reacting to what I was told.
Martin, we hired the best man we could find.
I'm going home.
There's only one thing you're good for anymore -- signing a damn voucher. Here. It's an authorization to employ a contractor.
You're tellin' me. I swear, this town has gone crazy.
What? What?!
How can you tell?
Depth-finder, fathometer, sonar, closed-circuit TV -- fore and aft -- RDF, single side band...  And two loose nuts behind the wheel.
You're situation here suggests that a Great White has staked out a claim in the waters around Amity Island, and that he will continue to feed here as long as there is food in the water.
That means closing the beaches.
Oh, no, sir. I've never had a woman do that. I'm sure she drowned.
What d'you pay for a place just for the summer?
I'm responsible for public safety around here...
Set?
I can't believe that people pay money to go fishing. This is really dumb. This isn't even relaxing... it's just boring.
Let him do it! Go-go-go-go-go!
Martin hates boats. Hates the water. On the ferry to the mainland, he sits in the car the whole way over. He's got this childhood thing, there's a clinical word for it.
Just fine, Missus. We'll be back soon. Everything's fine. We haven't seen anything yet. Orca out.
Just a little appetizer. I want our porker to know we're serving. I want to put some iron into that big yap...
It ain't a Big Mac.  The expert don't approve. What do you thing? You're closer to the situation. 
At least you handle the boat all right. Stop. Here... Cut the engine.
Let's just cut him open and see what's inside...
My mom uses color-safe bleach.
I did the prep questions for this lab last night. You can copy my answers if you need to.
Oh yeah. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, huh?
Were we together?
Huh?
Basically, I'm completely smitten with you, and I don't care if I'm making an ass out of myself right now, because you've seen me make an ass out of myself a million times, and you still want to be my friend.
That was my first instinct too. Or D.W.I. Anything but this. And I'm going to punch that Bleeker kid in the weiner the next time I see him.
I drove to St. Cloud to show Mark and Vanessa the ultrasound. And I wound up staying for a couple of hours.
Yes they are, Josh. Since Mankato, they have been lying eyes.
Did your wife send you up here to spy on me?
Wow, you get a whole room in your own house? She's got you on a long leash there, Mark.
What do you play?
I rock a Harmony.
What? I'm a pawn shop rocker.
Well, we were playing with them and I busted this guitar onstage. It cost me $800 and a dime bag just to have it fixed.
'93. I'm telling you that was the best time for rock and roll.
I mostly work from home. I'm a composer.
Have you seen those ads for Titanium Power men's deodorant?
They'd say you came a long way out here not knowing if anyone would be home.
It's only my favorite song. It's Sonic Youth doing "Superstar" by the Carpenters.
It's the least I can do. What did you say your favorite band was?
Please. Dario Argento is the ultimate master of horror.
My dad went through this phase where he was obsessed with Greek and Roman mythology. He named me after Zeus's wife. I mean, Zeus had other lays, but I'm pretty sure Juno was his only wife. She was supposed to be really beautiful but really mean. Like Diana Ross.
Isn't that great? I got it when I was in Japan with my band. She reminds me of you.
What?
It's just not working out, but I'm getting my own place in the city... and I've got it all planned out. It's something I've wanted to do for a long time...
That's not the point. We're just not in love anymore.
You found us in the Penny Saver?
Just, you know, shopping with my girlfriends.
Are you kidding? Everyone at school is always grabbing at my belly. I'm like a legend. They call me the Cautionary Whale.
Nothing.
Your name, please?
I have no idea what kind of girl I am.
I also have good teeth. No cavities. We finally got fluoridated water in Dancing Elk.
Well, it's kind of skanky. Isn't that what you girls call it? Skanky? Skeevy?
It's not easy, that's for sure. Now, I may not have the best track record in the world, but I have been with your stepmother for ten years now, and I'm proud to say that we're very happy.
When did you decide you were going to do Bleeker?
It's extremely complicated, and I'd rather not talk about it in my fragile state.
Come on, Leah. I can't scope out wannabe parents in the Penny Saver! That's tacky. That's like buying clothes at the Pump n' Munch.
Touche.
You sound shocked or something.
Please do not refer to Mr. Conyers as "Keith," okay? My barf reflex is already heightened these days.
Keith's hot.
He asked her. I heard they were going to Benihana, then the prom, then to Vijay's parents' cabin.
Oh no. Thank you. Come on in.
I think I'm leaning toward Custard in this light. I don't know. I should paint a small area...
She's hormonal. Right, June? It's just part of the whole process.
I didn't do anything... I just... I've just been thinking.
Just thinking if this is really the right thing for us.
It all just happened so fast. We put that ad in the paper. I thought it would take months if, you know, ever and then -- boom -- Two weeks later, she's in our living room.
Me neither. How 'bout you Carrie?
...Thank you.
Is it hard to learn?
Not really.
Early didn't kill nobody, he wouldn't do that. I don't know why you're saying those things. You ain't my friend.
Well Dorothy, why don't you hand me that chili there.
I heard that.
How many times you gonna tell me that?
As many times as it takes.
I don't know, they didn't speak too good English.
This guy killed a mess of people.
No, it's all yours. It's on me... for saving my ass back there.
What happened to Adele?
Real polite. Kept calling me 'sir.'
Beggars can't be choosers. They were the only ones who answered the ride share note, remember?
Funny, very funny.
Look again!
Oh come on, don't give me that shit... you wanted to take these photos as much as I wanted you too.
Not yet.
He wasn't going to shoot her, you murdering son of a bitch!
You sick twisted fuck! You don't know shit about me.
...I know I'd love to smash this bottle right in your fucking face.
I ain't got nothing against God. It's the people he let come into the world... lot of them should have been stopped at the door. What are you looking for?
Right, I talked to you on the phone. They say it's a torch job, that sound like your boy?
Looks like somebody cut off his ring finger.
Well now I'd say that's the least of Mr. Diebold's problems.
Hmm. I'd say eight, maybe nine.
Uh. Yes. Twice they weren't. Two times they didn't.
Who am I? Who am I? The mothafuckin' virgin surgeon.
How long did you fuck her?
Well, I was flipping through a picture book of her and her family, right.
She's probably smash you in the fucking face.
I don't know, he quit dealin' but I'll bet he'll smoke us out.
You think?
He lives on 76th?
It's no big deal, right?
Yeah, I feel dehydrated.
You down with the boost?
The cartoon?
Yeah.
I mean I've been with a lot of girls I know.
It's funny. Last weekend at that block party. Remember?
Yeah.
And after about two seconds, I got the biggest hard-on.
Yeah, good luck. I mean what the fuck. The guy had no legs.
I don't know. How much do you want?
Fifteen for me.
You are?
Why not? You stink.
Hold up man.
Where you at?
You sure?
Is it cold?
Yeah.
Tonight?
Here. Swallow.
Yeah.
What do I want to do?
I wouldn't believe it?
But, I don't know. I'm just scared that things would change. Between us.
Telly is at Steven's. There's a bunch of people over there. Come on dance.
The test isn't one hundred percent accurate. You should...
Am I getting warm?
Yeah. I was gonna write a book but I can't spell.
Passion...
Boom!!! Boom!!!
Hell yeah, they don't know.
Yeah. And you're not getting anything out of it.
Come on. Don't cry. We'll work it out.
And we were blasted, and he must have been dumb horney. And he just pulled me over to the bed. And they were in the room, like getting dressed, like getting ready to go to go to Disco
I start thinking about what I'm gonna eat afterwards.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No.
No. I was just kidding.
What?!
That's right.
Not too late.
You want a wip-it?
And we were like underneath the sheets. We were going at it like crazy. Oh my God that shit was so good! It was like hard...
To come?
No, no, no. You can't get that taste out of your mouth. Until you eat something.
OK.
What kind of problem?
What are you saying?
It wasn't serious.  What's your problem?
No, I need the original note.
If we knew that we'd know the answer to the riddle, wouldn't we?  He's telling us where he's going to kill tonight and we can't see it.
I'm positive.
Sit down!
No.  She just moved here last month from Portland.
I'm sorry, this is just too convenient.
Yeah, I am.  I think he's playing us. If I was a killer and the police were trying to make a case against me, what better why to draw them off than to put their attention on someone else?
It's a voice modulator.
What was suspicious about him?
But a hundred men could move him.
Oh, c'mon.  We're not going to spend any more time on this crap, are we?  It doesn't mean anything.  It's Sanderson!
It isn't him.  Frank, you brought me in on this in the beginning because you wanted my opinion if he was capable of doing this.
Just a second.  Hello?
Why not?
Then call them!
Please, I don't want to get into the psychological aspects of my actions. It would detract from the game.
How?
You're playing the Tarakoss opening.
--you're hopeless!  You can't even read a sentence!  Didn't they teach you punctuation in school?  The game ends tonight!
I've figured out the message.
No you haven't.  And even if you had it doesn't matter.  Who would you tell? The police don't believe you, and you've just used your only phone call.
Can we correlate data?  Look for specific things, like player's ages... stuff like that?
No problem.  We're in.
Fuck off!
Come here.
Uh huh.
I'm Kathy.
Boys.
How long has she been dead?
Not that I can see.  We'll know more once I get the lab reports back from Seattle.
Bingo.
You mean, no prints but hers?
There's only two hardware stores on the whole Island.  We'll check that out. What about the blood?
That means she was dead before we even finished figuring out the message.
What did Dr. Fulton tell you?
It's important.
I was thinking the same thing.  He must be local.  It's logical for him to assume that the police would be there, but he recognized Andy's voice and called him by name.  What about this?
He moves around a lot.  Why?
Yes.  Why not just say a building if he meant any general type of structure?
We're going to work on the message.
I can't arrest someone for having a cut on their wrist.  Do you have someone you can stay with tonight?
Maybe I already have.
But he had to dump the body there to make the move.
Wait a minute.  There's an apartment in that area called the Castle Arms.
He knows you're aware of that.
I suppose you have something in mind?
Whatever's on your mind.
No.
I can check and call you back.
Sara, this is Doctor Sheppard.  I called you earlier about a book.
"Carefully".  "Carefully". "Carefully".
If you're asking me if I'm passionate about what I do, the answer is yes. Without passion, nothing moves us. What's your passion?
This isn't a game.
What about you?  Aren't there times when a young child is telling you a story so sad you just want to cry?
Are you going to tell me you didn't feel something in there?
I'm sure you are.
I'm just trying to get to know you, Peter.
What are you talking about?  You don't even know me.
You've got to face the things you feel.
Then why are you backing up?
Exactly.  It's the key.
Where's the note?
I was thinking that... maybe when this is all over we could...
I want someone I can get close to. I don't know if that's possible with you.
That's still no excuse.  You treat everything like a game.
Why not?
I'm not nervous.
Mine was worse: I dreamt you picked your nose in public.
You <u>might</u> be handsome. I can't tell through all that grime. Besides, you reek of sweat and horses.
Never mind my ears! Go away!
You have the power. <u>Will it</u>.
Does the Queen live?
We were married. Then she was taken by the Slayers. You must help me.
There is no other way.
Reach out farther. Call to her.
Yes, they knew of your first contact, so they drove her below.
No! You cannot know that!
Saddles.
Staying alive.
He saved our lives.
You and I will guard the fire.
How did you know I had sons?
Those are not child's tear. A child cries for himself, a man cries for those he loves.
Yes. It will double our range.  I know at least a dozen ways to get horses. All cheap.
Lad, you have an unnatural desire to pay for things. It stunts the mind and shrivels the imagination.
The best. But my unhappiness is not made lighter by adding your's to it.
I intend to keep you alive, your majesty. So you can abdicate your throne and become my Warlord.
Would you settle for a boar?
Tonight and every night, my friend, for this is the second time you've saved my life.  I am Ergo the Magnificent, short in stature, tall in power, etcetera, etcetera.
We'll meet you at the inn.
Smart lad.  Bring me my spices!
And do you think I'm not going to eat myself to death this very night? Huh?
And do you think I live on air?
If that were so, you'd be dead now. He was aiming at the Dark One, for there is ancient hatred between them. Once his race had two eyes, like other men, until his forefathers bargained with the Dark Ones: they gave up one of their eyes in return for the power to see the future. But they were cheated, for the only future they were permitted to see was the time of their own death.
He is the King.
It is only a few weeks and already half our strong places have fallen.
You knew! You are a rude bumpkin!
A fine match.
He leads a group of Slayers, under the leopard banner.
Yes. You have left your place in the Needle. It is the time, then.
They will fail for, during the day, the power of the Circle is greater than theirs. Only at night can they pierce the Circle.
Power you have given me. What can my power give you?
Knowledge.
...Office 2702.
No... Not yet.  He's very shy... and very sensitive.
It's better...  You see, it's my turf, so I don't want contracts I'm not informed about, on my turf.  I'm not opposing, but the least they can do is informing me, isn't it?
Listen, think about what you want to do, but don't worry, your money is there and it's safer than in a bank... Banks are robbed every five minutes!
I'll explain you, Leon: they'll ask you to fill in a lot of forms and you can't write and they'll ask you your job, your employer's name and you can't tell them: My job, I'm a hitman and my employer is Tony, his record is longer than his resturant's menu.  That's why you can't have a bank account!
It's not serious, it's just training. You have to learn from the beginning to hit the target, then, to improve precision, you'll train, but on cardboards.
There, the guy... How did you do that, without even touching him? Without noise. It's like you put him away... How did you do it?
...Don't you like me?
...Yes. The day he got out of jail. I allowed him to make ten steps... No more. And bang. Two hundred meters. By telescope. That night, I left my country and came here, to join my father, who worked for Tony.  ...I was 17. Then, I never left the city...  And never had another girlfriend...
Yes.
Good! Snipers can't be in position.
No, no! I don't want to go!  I don't want!
...No... he's my lover...
Huh... Yeah, yeah... Of course.
Messina.
Did you fish in Messina? The "pesce spada"?
Why am I such an authority?
You'd be visiting me at Nasa.
That's enough.
We operate.  We find the artery in the brain and close the bleeding... I just did this procedure on a Senator and he's doing fine.
I'm going to ask you a question that may sound peculiar.
No.  How far in one attempt -- what's the farthest someone like myself could walk?
It's just a regular day.
Yes.
Exactly.  No reason.  No occasion. It just makes you feel good to do something for it, to express your pride and affection for it some how...  How come you'd do that for a piece of metal and not for me?
No.  But I want to take a walk with you.
Please tell me.
Good.
Do you believe a person's soul lives on after their death?
P-A-R-K-E-R.  Right.  Get on the horn with Philly.  Call me here.
Umm, Coalville Utah.
Write from your heart.  That's why the classics are great.
What Mr. Parker?
... The Grapes of Wrath.
I need your help.
They told me, you might try to talk me into something... You need to rest Mr. Parker... It's for your own good.  I've been following your story for a long while.  It's a beautiful thing you did.
You ever lose somebody Stephanie?
Forty-seven years.
How are you feeling?
We did a piece after your story ran in the New York Times.
This is my only chance to get a watch like that.  It would mean a lot to me and my family.  Please take it.  It really isn't that much.
No.
Water?
Hello.
I guess I do too.
You what?
OK... whatever.
Yes... that should do it. What am I? A luxury?
No, just drunk... but that's OK. Where's your car?
I sold it this morning. I'm going to take cabs from now on in.
I have to change and take a shower first. If you want to come home and wait.
I like hearing you talk.  If you feel up to a short walk, there's a place to eat around the corner. All the food in Vegas is terrible so the place doesn't really matter. How does that sound to you?
Yes.
Interesting choice of words. I don't remember. I just know that I want to.
I don't know.  I'll go and sort it out today. Why don't you come?... We'll find a real room for me. You can pick it out, a tower on the strip.
What do you mean?
Of course.
Very well... umm... I never expected to have to ask you this again... but how did our evening go? I remember getting to the casino... I remember kissing you... that was really nice but everything after that is a blank.
I don't understand any of that.
Where was that house? The one in LA, I mean.
Yes.
How much, do you think?
Yes, that would be great. Are you her for the convention?
I'm sorry, I guess I misunderstood.
I am lonely, Yuri.
I don't need backups. Harvard is the school I'm going to.
He did leave a Cher tape in the pool house once --
No.
Uh, yeah, because the bitch shot him.
And when you came downstairs, what happened?
No, she'd stashed it by then.
No. I was in the shower.
Yes.
Aristotle.
I couldn't help it! It was the most fun I've had since I've been in law school. Not only was I good enough for Warner -- I was better than him. He has to see serious I am now. Even Donovan was impressed, and he's a total hard-ass.
Look at him. He's still scratching his head.
Relation?
I'm still can't believe you didn't tell Donovan the alibi.
Did you know he got wait-listed when he applied? His father had to make a call.
You're kidding!
You guys are so sweet!
No, but she made me cry once. Not in class -- I waited until I got to my room, but yeah, she can pretty much shrivel your balls -- or you know, your whatevers.
She married an old man, she's made a living on telling women they're too fat, she hawks her crap on the Home Shopping Network...
I can't.
Wait -- Hilary Clinton.
What're you talking about? You earned it --
What if you're trying to be something you are? The hell with Donovan. Stay.
So Friday at eight?
What do you think?
Helloo... he just had lunch with his grandmother. You know he got "The Rock".
What happened?
What, like on va-kay?
What?
I can't believe you're a Laker Girl!
You should. Do you have a resume?
Has Warner Huntington checked in yet?
And I fully support that.
I never met the woman, but from what my daughter tells me, she's quite the cun --
Faith.
Nay.  This is a private affair, no audience welcome... Better you watch the dismantling of our enemies... and, look you, see the moat is set aflame.
Indeed, the best of fun... Enjoy yourselves.
You are cruel!  Your heartless jesting worse than torture!  How can you speak of love when you see what I am!
But I'm hideous!
You should glory in your animal nature.  It is your triumph!  None know that better than I!
Not from me, surely...
Do you feed on mice and rats?
Yes?
It's nothing.  My men take great delight in routing the enemy.  Don't trouble yourself, beauty.
And, now?
Well, er... no.  I mean, you don't look like dragons I've heard of.
East of Mercia?
You don't ravage the countryside, devouring maidens and burning the crops?
Dance, Jack!  The night's but begun.
You'll have a long, long rest in the tomb, me lad.
Didn't you now?  Well then, answer me this riddle and all be forgiven.
I've laid eyes on no mortal but you this day, Jack.
How is it this hag knows the truth?
Lamentable news, Jack... but tis the fate of the living concerns us now.
A tomb it once was, boy, and a tomb it may yet be... There's another in residence at Lindfarne now.
No less a creature than the Lindfarne Worm.
You do the praying.  I've work ahead.
We've no time for tricks this day, Honeythorn Gump.
How do you plan on finding this here castle, if ye don't mind me asking?
Sounds like the bird we want.  All right lads, follow yon raven!
Foul fellow, this Couer de Noir.
I trust our own welcome will be more hospitable.
No... but what choice have we?
Aye, so long as you're not too greedy for the bait.
Faerie magic's no match for a sorcerer's power... We have Ogg's gifts, the key and the --
Best get down close to the moat, lad.
Nonsense!  Course it matters.
Can you save her?
The alicorn, lad.  Come to your senses!  Unless we find Baron Couer de Noir and bring back the horn the world is doomed.
Mean you to seek him out below?
Sunlight.
He'll not escape me.
I was with the Princess.
Gonna make ogre-stew!
I may have said perhaps...
Liar!
Not if you be chaste.  Tis an awesome test of virginity.
My own father...
Good.  They'll never catch him. There's not a mount in the kingdom can outrun a unicorn.
Tis the truth.
A maid must beware of flattery... Methinks you want to kiss me.
Tis not fit for a princess.
I have no wife.
Whilst you were sleeping, I fetched your ring.
But... I am a Green Man.  I have no title, nor lands... scarce even a few vines and threads to keep the cold from my body.
Everywhere!  Ow!
Grand champion, is it?  And what great cause leads you to me?
Well spoke, boy.  You have discerning taste for one so young... Just who might you be?
Come sit beside me, sweet boy, and I'll draw you a map.
Please...
Heading north still?
I think she's about to foal.
Oh, but I have.
You're well equipped, I'd say. Legendary arms...
May God protect you.
Nay.  Castle Couer de Noir is Devil's work... built with sorrow and grief...
I thought I might stop by.
Sam!
It's so beautiful.
No.
Nope.
What are you doing here?
Where to?
I'm supposed to be in Tahoe.
I don't know.
I wanted him to marry her.
Why?
I'm okay.
I don't even...what do you mean?  I don't even know what that means.
Does everything have to have a point?
I thought I was helping you.
I don't wanna go.
If my kids and my wife were always at an ex-husband's house, I'd worry.
Well, if it is, we have a problem.
Pardon me?
When we divorce a decade ago, she was very, very angry.  Now she's just hostile.
Which is why we bid out a quarter of our projects.  It doesn't make a lot of sense anymore to want what we don't have and don't want what we do.
I didn't know there would be a quiz, George.
Thank you.
Yes, it is.
You're here early today.
My life is a warning.  I just can't figure out for what.
I'll get your bag.
I almost saw Catalina.
Goodnight.
I warned you yesterday.
Your brothers are right.  It was the most god-awful smell I've ever had my nose around.
Why don't you just beg some money off my dad and move into something decent with a real kitchen and a real bathroom?
You can't promise me anything!  You don't have anything to promise!  You live in a garage!  You don't have cable!  You're not hooked up to the internet because you don't even own a computer!  You don't have a job!
Well, until you know, you can't go.
Oh, okay.
A friend of yours is here.
We haven't build shit.  You're just tearing down your father.
Hi, Mom.
If I asked you to stop, would you?
Sun glasses?
That's so weird...
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
We just weren't very much alike, I guess. I don't know.  I liked your dad more than I liked you.
But you can't call me while you think?
I love those doors.
One of you would end up dead.
Did you tell him he was spending the summer with me?
I used to live here.
Which?
It was perfect, George.  Amazing.  It was so real.
I didn't think you'd come today.
Left you?
So could I.
You got the money?
I wasn't sure.
The payoff.
Is Lois still here?  I'm starved.
So am I, Robin.  I'm working at something, too.  I'm even talking.  Do you want to be around for it?
Sam took them to a movie.
Why?
Okay.
Not all day.  I'll be home after lunch.
You can try, but you won't get too far. Why you interested?
Maybe you didn't notice, but this is a prison.
Oh, she's fine. She's just not coming today.
I'm too old for you. Besides, I'm not much in the mood.
Yes, boss.
Over forty years now. Me and Ray Gibson out there.
Yes, sir.
I'm not your boss. Not anymore.
That's what respectable folks do. Get a job, get married, start having babies. That's what you want, isn't it?
But I'm having a good time...
He seemed like a pretty good lawyer to me. His offices take up an entire floor of that big, new building on 125th Street, and he was using all these words I never heard before. He even offered me a job.
Sure, Claude, whatever you say.
I don't think so.
At some point a man's got to get serious about his future. I'm sure you have no idea what I'm talking about.
Bank teller's just a start. I got plans. Real plans. Not opening some Zoom-Boom Room. This time next year I'll be a loan officer.
While you were upstairs doing God's work, I was getting jack-legged by a fool with four threes.
He even got my daddy's watch.
He's dead.
My daddy's watch. This is the dude I was telling you about --
Somebody just told me he wins the three-legged race every year.
He just blocked it out. Nigger's crazy. He's the one who did all the stabbing. He's capable of some heinous shit.  How 'bout him down there?
Forget it.
I'm not gonna forget it. What does that mean? If you've got a plan, I think I have a right to know about it. I told you my plan.
Look, my cousin Maynard is a lawyer. He filed an appeal on my behalf --
We're in the Bronx, my man. Hundred and Sixty First Street.
Allie Reynolds. He's my boy.
Can't be worse than any of these other fools.
Don't matter who Camp 12 puts on the mound. All I know is when this season's over Camp 8's gonna have pork chops.
I'm not in the mood right now, Ray.
Excuse me? Are you talking to me?
That was five years ago.
You haven't driven in 40 years, you ain't even got a license. Man's taking his life in his hands, putting you behind the wheel! Where you taking him?
What the hell are you doing in that trunk?!
I ain't escaping! We're picking up the new super just like I told you.
You ain't getting out of that trunk.
Come on, man, I'm starting to cramp up here.  We have the chance right here, right now, I say we go!
Claude, man, I'm serious. Give me those keys.
He's got my daddy's watch, Claude. I always knew whoever took that watch killed Winston Hancock. And that was you, Mr. Pike.
Tell me about it. Scared me at first. Then, before I could figure out what to do with it, it was gone. Imagine my disappointment.
What do you expect? It's almost as old as we are.
I saw that hot dog guy in the bathroom urinating. He didn't wash his hands.
Gimme that damn thing.
Well, if you must know, they could be closer.
Then you won't have no problem making the adjustment. You need anything, help of any kind, gimme a holler. Name's Jangle Leg.
Can't I get one of those steaks you got grilling back there?
Those are for trusties, unless you got thirty cents or two packs of cigs.
Judge gave 'em the long ride.
No, they didn't get their pardons, you dumb shit! If they'd got their pardons way back then, we wouldn't be burying them today, would we?
1932? That's like, that's like...
I heard some things so I went to see Spanky Johnson. He told me what happened and gave me some money to get down here. What happened to your face?
Don't you lie to me, Rayford.  You still have your daddy's watch?  Well, this is all I can give you. I wish it was more.
You may be able to buy your way out of trouble up in New York City, but down here we take murder seriously.
No, it says Marleen here.
They're called subways. A nickel will take you from one end of Manhattan to the other. Helluva ride, too.
Satchmo.
What are you in for, Willie?
I just want somebody who won't put a bullet in my back once the truck is full.
Eventually, Cassius. But first we corrupt as many as we can so that when we do destroy them...
All right. Let me out.
You mother...
Don't do it!
Noon...
Or maybe it will trap me inside for all eternity.
Try four and a half. At first I totally didn't like him.
Yeah, you do...
That turn you on there, RuPaul?
The shit has hit the fan, kid. Take a look.
Look. You were really high. Things happen.
I was with Valerie, I swear. This is Adrian's work. I've got to find him.
I think you're looking at him.
C'mon, man, I'm just asking for one Superbowl ring.
Such a sweet boy. But after much thought and careful consideration, I've decided that the ruler for the next ten thousand years is going to have to be... me.
Metallica, Dad. Come on.
I can't hear you, Nicky. I can't hear anything!
What about you and Grandpa and everyone in Hell?
I know, your wickedness.
That's nice, Grandpa. Why don't you just enjoy the fishing?
Okay, but Jimmy, when the house is rockin', don't forget the knockin'!
You're the spawn of Satan. You got it in you.
We know where to find Nicky.
You keep a bat under your seat?
I was DeNiro!
You smell like coconuts.
I don't know, but I like it. Say. Your glasses are nice. They make your eyes look sparkly and big. It's fun to look at them.
My dad's an optometrist.
I'm sorry. It's really tough when your parents get older.
Thanks much. You know what's nice about you, Valerie?
No.
..."The Devil?"...
From my dad's side of the family.
I've always wanted to kill someone. Can I do it?
I don't know?
Your turn.
Where do you send them?
Up there.
I never even visited Nursery before tonight.  When you wonder, it slows you up -- you know?
Of course.
Holly. Holly! Please... The other Sandman. Remember the one who came after --
Well then...?
A friend of mine went on Carousel tonight. Now he's gone.
Killed? Why do you use that word?
Jessica.
And?
About what?
I'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, I suppose?
Thanks... but I have the choice.
I don't believe you. There has to be more.
Why not? Maybe she'll help me. You won't. You'd better stay here.
Uh-uh.
Where? Sanctuary? Can you take me there?
All right. But why? I didn't kill the Runner.
They won't believe us.
Why, Jessica? You're still a green.
I wanted to...  ...And you... what made you kill Sandmen?
How would anyone know? Even if we find it -- we can never go back.
We can't. We're going back.
Sanctuary is the right to live... nothing more. But nothing less, either...
Beloved wife...
They're put into the ground so they can be visited by the living...
Hello.
It's all right with me. Is he here?
My name's Holly... Holly 13. In ancient times they said my number was unlucky. Do you believe in luck?
Have any other people ever passed through?
Mother and -- ? You knew your mother and father?
Dead... they're dead... and buried.
All right.
Clear Logan-5 and Francis-7.
Yeah.
This is our bedroom.
Maid? Relative?
Can I call you?
I'll call you again.
He works for Mr. Eddy.
He makes films for Mr. Eddy.
What if Andy tips off Mr. Eddy?
Yes, I believe so.
Feeling good, Arnie. Ready to get to work.
Wonderful, Pete. Really wonderful. Alotta people Pete... alotta people are gonna be very happy.
Yeah.
He won't give his name.
I did a routine once-over, and gave him a sleeping pill. I've never seen this man before. Neither have the guards. I don't think he's in the system.
Let's have a look at the hallway outside the bedroom.
The first night... Not the last two.
But my head...
I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
Of course. In fact, I'm there right now.
That's absurd.
Wake me up when you get home.
Does it say anything on the tape?
Oh. Oh, yeah. No. This is a different one.
I must have fallen asleep. I was asleep when you got home, wasn't I?
Now! We're leaving now! I didn't want to come here in the first place.
He's got some fucked up friends.
No, no... It's okay, Mr. Eddy.
You will.
I'm sure you noticed that girl that was with me the other day... Good lookin' blonde? She stayed in the car?...
We just killed a couple of people...
Sure.
What do you mean?... You've been acting strange lately... Like the other night.
Sheila?!
"Leaving today for London with Conway aboard S.S. Manchuria. Conway can tell nothing of his experiences. Is suffering from complete loss of memory. Signed, Gainsford."
Well, what do you know about that!
I just feel as though I'm being made ready for the executioner.
Thinking? What about some double solitaire?
And this trip to the valley. I can't imagine why I'd allow you to drag me down here. Why, we don't know anything about these people. We're not even armed!
They're very nice people - except that they've got horns.
Please! Please! Do not wait for me! I eat so very little.
Over by that hill.
We follow many.
Oh, let me see - way back in 1713, I think it was, that Father Perrault stumbled into the Valley, half frozen to death. It was typical of the man that, one leg being frozen, and of course there being no doctors here, he amputated the leg himself.
Rather astonishingly so, yes. And particularly so in the case of Father Perrault himself. Do you know when he and the natives were finished building Shangri-La, he was 108 years old and still very active, in spite of only having one leg?
Very often.
Why, Mr. Conway, you surprise me!
Leave Shangri-La! That's not likely. You couldn't drive her out.
You shouldn't be looking at the bottom of the mountain. Why don't you try looking up at the top sometimes?
Yes.
You may not know it, Mr. Chang, but right here you have Utopia.[15]
We have reason. It is the entire meaning and purpose of Shangri-La. It came to me in a vision, long, long, ago. I saw all the nations strengthening, not in wisdom, but in the vulgar passions and the will to destroy. I saw their machine power multiply until a single weaponed man might match a whole army. I foresaw a time when man, exulting in the technique of murder, would rage so hotly over the world that every book, every treasure, would be doomed to destruction. This vision was so vivid and so moving that I determined to gather together all the things of beauty and culture that I could and preserve them here against the doom toward which the world is rushing.  Look at the world today! Is there anything more pitiful?  What madness there is, what blindness, what unintelligent leadership! A scurrying mass of bewildered humanity crashing headlong against each other, propelled by an orgy of greed and brutality. The time must come, my friend, when this orgy will spend itself, when brutality and the lust for power must perish by its own sword. Against that time is why I avoided death and am here, and why you were brought here. For when that day comes, the world must begin to look for a new life. And it is our hope that they may find it here. For here we shall be with their books and their music and a way of life based on one simple rule: Be Kind.  When that day comes, it is our hope that the brotherly love of Shangri-La will spread throughout the world.  Yes, my son, when the strong have devoured each other, the Christian ethic may at last be fulfilled, and the meek shall inherit the earth.
Because, my son, I am placing in your hands the future and destiny of Shangri-La.  For I am going to die.
Just this once, Bob. I feel like celebrating. Just think of it, Bob - a cruiser sent to Shanghai just to take you back to England. You know what it means.  Here you are. Don't bother about those cables now. I want you to drink with me.  Gentlemen, I give you Robert Conway - England's new Foreign Secretary.
Just you wait until I'm Foreign Secretary. Can't you just see me, Freshie, with all those other shrewd, little Foreign Secretaries?  You see, the trick is to see who can out-talk the other. Everybody wants something for nothing, and if you can't get it with smooth talk, you send an army in. I'm going to fool them, Freshie. I'm not going to have an army. I'm going to disband mine. I'm going to sink my battleships - I'm going to destroy every piece of warcraft. Then when the enemy approaches we'll say, "Come in, gentlemen - what can we do for you?"  So then the poor enemy soldiers will stop and think. And what will they think, Freshie? They'll think to themselves - "Something's wrong here. We've been duped. This is not according to form. These people seem to be quite friendly, and why should we shoot them?" Then they'll lay down their arms. You see how simple the whole thing is? Centuries of tradition kicked right in the pantsâ€  â€”and I'll be slapped straight into the nearest insane asylum.
It's not knowing that's so awful, Bob. Not knowing where you're going, or why, or what's waiting when you get there.
Dead?
Yes.
I'm afraid the porters are just a myth.  I guess we never will know why we're here, or how long we're going to be held prisoners.
George. George - do you mind? I'm sorry, but I can't talk about it tonight.
So you think I'm mad?
So you think it's all nonsense, huh?
George, I may be wrong, I may be a maniac. But I believe in this, and I'm not going to lose it.  You know how much I want to help you, but this is bigger, stronger if you like than brotherly love. I'm sorry, George. I'm staying.
I don't believe it! I don't believe a word of it!
What about the others?
What if he refuses?
In for what?
You're absolutely right. And I had to come all the way to a pigeon house in Shangri-La to find the only other person in the world who knew it. May I congratulate you?
Well, I was almost born here. It took place in that wild country beyond the pass. My father and mother were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered around for a year. When Chang found us, only Father and I were alive. But he was too weak to climb the pass. He died on the way. I was brought up here by Father Perrault himself.
Oh, the usual reasons. A world full of people struggling for existence.
I was just going to.
Go? Where?
You'll wait till you rot!
Hesitated, sir.
It means I know you think you got a beat on things.  But trust me, you don't.  You don't even have an inkling of a hint of a clue as to what's really going on in the world.    And if you want to find out even a little, you'll shut up and come with me. And if you don't, fine.  Go with them. Cause I'm not interested in breaking in another little hot-shot only to have him wig or die on me just when I'm starting to count on him.  So forgive me if you don't exactly hear me ringing little bells and whistling welcome aboard, but this isn't the Love Boat.  And I'm not Captain Fucking Stubing.  Now I'm sorry.  But this has been one long, bad day.
What happens if I say no?
Oh. Shit. it's in the car--
Kay, I'm sorry...
Don't worry about it.  It's been a long night.  Speaking of which-- you owe me a cup of coffee, remember?
Don't worry about it.
Home?  You gotta be kidding me.    Black?
Kay...
INS, Washington.  Special services.
Sir--
Oh. Right.  I guess that's kind of cool, too, in it's own way.  Course, this isn't really black; it's kind of a dull, dirty, tarry sort of noncolor, isn't it?
She didn't even know you. .
I know, that's usually the only time I actually have a shot.  And what if I wanted to see her again?  I'd have to completely re-introduce myself.
I know, I know.  I read the manual. No attachments.  We work alone. Blah. blah.
If it was just a meal, why did they have so much luggage?
A what?
And what's this ... ?
I don't want to rattle you, but Dee was here for the War of the Worlds.
We're rising.
Well... if you think about it, then it would mean that maybe everything he's saying is true.
Do his job.
In case I need it.
Kay!?
There wasn't time, sport!
You know, there's something we never really thought of...
What the hell does that mean?
What if you have the foggiest clue as to where the queen is?
Maybe you need a closer look.
No-- a Person is smart.  People are dumb.    And the more people you put together, the dumber they get.  And you know that.
We've got about eight or nine prospects	I want you look--
Did our friend announce when he's making his speech?
Did he say where?
Actually, yeah--
Cause I think we're looking at it.
Where's he making his big speech?
Don't tell me.  Insects.
And I assume you're bringing this to us because we're the most powerful country on the planet...
Can you see?
Agatha...
Can you see the balloon man?
You were right.  I'm not being set up.
She grew up.
RUN!
Why?
Lara --
I'm saying the third prevision wasn't there.  And that's not all. I spent a few hours down there and it turns out there's a dozen more cases with missing previsions.
She's worried about you.  And, quite frankly, so am I.
I'm fine.
And who the hell is that?
I'm out of breath!  I'm a fucking fugitive!
How could Witwer have accessed the case file?
Then go ahead, pull the trigger.
Did he close the front door?
Sir?
Any ID on the shooter yet?
Still scrubbing... looks like there's a third party, somebody wearing shades just out the window...
You're certain?
Speaking of interfacing, I'd love to say hello.
I have a warrant in my pocket that says different.
I agree.  The system is perfect. If there's a flaw, it's human.  It always is.  Thank you for the tour, Wally.
Wally.  This is Danny Witwer.  He's from Justice and we're to give him a full run of the farm.
It could have been a nightmare... Sometimes they dream about the old murders.
Rufus, for Christ's sake, get up.
They don't belong to anybody.
Tell me how.
Sean, wait...
His name was Sean.  Six years ago. Francis pool.
No.
You're not gonna kill me...
You can tell me how someone... could fake a prevision.
I'm not.  I was trying to heal them, not turn them into... something else.
Insignificant to you maybe, but what about those people I put away with alternate futures?  My God, if the country knew there was a chance they might not --
Hold that thought.
You shouldn't.  You shouldn't trust anyone... certainly not the Attorney General who wants it all for himself.  Not the young federal agent who wants your job.  Not even the old man who just wants to hang onto what he's created.  Don't trust anyone.  Just find the Minority Report.
You said they're destroyed.
What safe place is that?
Actually, I think you'll have to run out, but yes, that's what you have to do.
You're insane or you think I am.
Then how did he --
Six years ago.  What did you two talk about yesterday afternoon?
None of your damn business.
What?
I wanna kill my boss.
No, I wanna kill my boss!
Somehow, I don't think that was Walt Whitman.
No offense, sir, but why wouldn't he just run?
Because he thinks he's innocent.
It's not at all that you don't trust me to be alone with the Chief.  That you think I might, you know, fuck with him, if I had the chance...
How can you even tell?  You know how blind you are without your glasses.
Just sugar then.  You and John ever come here?
No, but then I don't talk to John that much anymore.
It wasn't a suicide attempt.  I regret ever saying that.
Jesus...
Maxie wants me to replace you on the job tomorrow. He wants you to come by the office today.
Just give me the key. I'm gonna stay here.
Yes, sir.
You girls aren't from Brooklyn or anything?
Bullshit.
He's not doing it.
Will you paint the damn thing. Why do you gotta be such a baby.
I love you. Come home.
Some favor. I hope they know you're not like Wendy.
Well, that's not gonna happen.
Leave me alone. I haven't touched anything in months.
Ho's a fucking pimp! He encourages Wendy to turn tricks. And she's his fucking wife!
I don't give a shit. I work for her. No touching.
5-5-1.
I'm serious. Humping sheetrock and driving on weekends got to get to you after a while. Might be nice to buy your lady something. All it takes is one fight.
Nah, man. He's just making contact. That's our man. The Welsh guy.
So, when's the drop.
Where is this happening?
What do you mean 'troughed?'
They ran shit back in the Eighties. Used to cut motherfuckers heads off and sit them on the bar. That's back when the Irish was making a play against the Italians. I don't know if they still around, but I don't fuck with those motherfuckers just in case.
It sounds to me like everybody's just a little jumpy. And since all it is is a drop, the Welshman's got nothing at stake. I say we go to his 'troughed off' bar. It'll calm his nerves, we drop the bag, and we all get back to our lives.
And not a word to Maxie. He'll shit if he knew we crossed a bridge.
Where's Ricky.
She was fast, huh?
Don't I put food on you're table? I sponsor your training, I take care of your girl and her little baby. I even pay that deadbeat friend of yours to push a goddamn broom.
That was before he lost my carpet cleaning van.
How 'bout this. If you're in, he's in.
You want --
What drill?
Tom, the Welsh dude --
Hi. I'm Jimmy.
No. Just the cross streets.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's important.
We're supposed to meet him here. Is Ruiz on the list?
Yeah. Page me. You know the number?
I know the number.
I'll page you with the number.
Bye.
I do. It's a fuckin Persian Palace.
Then why do you try to get in?
Hey, baby... Nothing. What are you doing...? Yeah, I'll probably cut out early...
You wanna go right now?
Who's driving her?
I'll get the girl.
I don't want to show up hammered. We're supposed to be representing Max.
How much? Okay. Make it fifteen minutes and you can add on a ten dollar tip. Bye.
Jesus, man. Plus ten?
Yeah, I guess.
Great. On my fucking room.
Fuck...
They didn't say an address?
So they said more than the address.
Motherfucker...
Oh, give me a break. Don't tell me you feel bad for the guy.
I swear to God, I'll fucking puke.
The penguin house.
I'm pretty sure we do.
Wanna bet?
Let's get some sleep. That's what we need, man. Sleep.
Easy...
Kinda. Yeah.
How is it you're good? You on a list?
Cool. See you later.
You're up front. Everything's free up here.
Where do you live?
What the fuck, 'Red Dragon?'
No?
Nah, see, Maxie just asked him to set that shit up as a favor. He, you know, he tied in with the club. Set us up so, you know, you feel at home.
Well, he ain't gonna be around no more.
Here...
You know my pager number?
Yeah, bring us four fernet.
You want... Why are you picking on me?
Outfit? What's he talking about?
So, we're talking money laundering...
Mmmm-hmm. Where's the, uh, 'Dragon's lair?' Where do you live?
I am.
He had it coming.
Not this boy... I ain't fighting their war. I got my own. Right chere. Heard tell you're a good man to know.
My papa taught me one thing: don't never bullshit a West Indian bullshit artist.
'Cause I want in. And it don't take a lot to know you there, daddy.
I keep all my numbers in my head. I've never written any down.
Bet you are.
What you talking?
Yeah. I got a couple a new angles ain't been figured yet. All I need's a stake and a  chance --
Can you use a few bucks? I ain't got much, but --
You putting a hurtin' on my vision.
Man, get outa my face. I ain't nobody's punk.
When you go busting your fists against a stone wall, you're not using your brains. Cause that's what the white man wants you to do. Look at you.
But everything the white man taught you, you learned. He told you you were a black heathen and you believed him. He told you how he took you out of darkness and brought you to the light. And you believed him. He taught you to worship a blond, blue-eyed God with white skin -- and you believed him. He told you black was a curse, you believed him. Did you ever look up the word black in the dictionary?
You got to learn everything the white man says and use it against him. The truth is laying there if you smart and read behind their words. It's buried there. You got to dig it out.
Where am I gonna start?
Lemme tell you about history: black history. You listening?
I can't.
I don't know what to say to Allah.
Has the Reverend called? Is he going to show?
So it is not a matter of the breeding conditions or preparation of the meat. The meat itself is foul.
What?
No, good Sisters are rare. We need every one. Tell me something: how tall are you?
How old are you, Betty?
There's always talk, always been talk, and always will be talk. Don't they say how I'm trying to take over the Nation, how I'm getting rich off the Nation?
We'll get to that, too, but this isn't just talk any more.
I'm not interested in personal publicity. Our people know what I'm doing.
Is that what this is about? Material wealth?
What do we have, Malcolm. A broken- down jalopy and the clothes on our backs. We don't even own our own home. What about our children? What about me? You don't even own life insurance.
I'm tired of praying.
Malcolm, where are you? We've been calling all over the city.
So now we have no opening speaker? Why wasn't I informed last night?
But we do know that the people of that region of Asia Minor, from the Tigris-Euphrates valley to the Mediterranean, are dark-skinned people. I've studied drawings and photographs and seen newsreels. I have never seen a native of that area who was not black.
Please, go ahead.
Well, I have this to say. Do you know what a Negro with a B.A., an M.A. and a Ph.D. is called -- by the white man? I'll tell you. He's called a nigger.
Allah Akbar.
Sure, man.
With him?
I know where you're going.
I think sometimes, Mrs. Little, candor is the only kindness.
500.
Well, all reet, then.
Shorty, this is Laura.
I'm tired of always playing the cops. I wanna be Bogart sometimes.
Jesus Christ, Homey, you are nuts.
What can you do?
Head nigger in charge?
Yes, I am, Brother Minister. All I want is support for my children. He should provide for his children. That's all I want.
He's bright.
I wasn't there. Like I was some kind of pedigreed dog or a horse. Like I was invisible.
No. It would be convenient, but no.
Sit, Creasy. Everything that happens from now on does so with my permission.  Really. You won't find a better carne asada in all of Mexico.
He was one of the original founders of 'Le Hermanidad' in the days when it represented good not evil.
I want to arrest you for murder! I want to shake your hand and reload your gun! I want to kill my pride and give you my blessing.
No, but I have to admit I thought about it.
[South America.]
[Where are you staying in Mexico?]
[I'm on to Juarez.]
[The what?]
[Who are you?]
[Me, too. Tell me about the guardians.]
I don't know, but I know his face.
[He has a tattoo covering two-thirds of his back. He is part of the Brotherhood.]
[What do you mean?]
[And one of the founding members of La Hermanidad.]
[It's all up to you, commandante. Tell me about you and 'The Dreamer'.]
[That's what everybody keeps saying.]
Got no plans, Rayburn, Nothing on. Just wanted to see you, how you were. Came by on impulse.
So you'll be the silent type. People will appreciate that.
Frank doesn't take to most people. Do you speak German?
Why not?
That's right.
Not at all?
So you were unhappy?
I go to school, don't I?
Once I get in the water but not starting off. By the time I catch up, it's too late.
They can stay for two weeks. I don't care.
I'm too old for him. Don't tell my friends.
It's not too bad. Will it take a long time before it's better? Our big swim meet is in three weeks. Interschools. I was going to swim in the one hundred meter freestyle.
What did you do in Asia? Is that where you met the man with cigarettes?
No, that was in Columbia.
You were never late before, I was worried.
Are you afraid of me?
That's not a question.
Be a swimmer.
Like St. Jude. A hopeless case that has a complete block about 'C' Minor. But remember, "Whoever resists authority will bring judgement upon themselves." New Testament, Romans 13.
Don't forget your towel.
Samuel, it is not something we should skimp on. A bodyguard's presence in the car or outside the school was at least some form of deterrent. Now he's gone, I feel totally exposed.
Do you have any family, Mr. Creasy?
I think it's fantastic.
[Is that good or bad?]
[I think he's... magnificent.]
[A beautiful circle.]
[I should start going for your tits first.]
This is my jurisdiction. I want these men as much as Creasy does.
He'll deliver more justice in a weekend, than ten years of your courts and tribunals. So stay out of his way.
Millie's been after me to fix her up with a date, so I...
You wanna have a drink before we start dancing?
Which one was that?
I'll call her up.
Oh, I couldn't eat nothing. My mother just stuffed me right up to the jaws.
She musta kept you inna shadows all night.
Waddaya getting so sore about?
Do you remember Emilio DiGiorgio, owned the tavern in Abruzzi?
You know what they say. They say things are no good in this house. Catherine, your son is married. Leave him in peace. He wantsa be alone with his wife. They don't want no old lady sitting inna balcony. Now I tell you what I think. I want you come live with me in my house with Marty and me. In my house, you have your own room. You don't have to sleep onna couch inna living room like here. We will cook inna kitchen and talk like when we were girls. You are dear to me, and you are dear to Marty. We are pleased for you to come.
It pains that they should do this.
Oh sure.  This girl is a college graduate.
I'm afraid of being lonely.
What're you talking about? You're a real likeable person. You'll make friends out there in Portchester one, two, three. You'll have people visiting you alla time. I'll come visit you. I'll borrow my brother Freddie's car, or you can call me up when you feel blue, or I'll call you up. And it's gonna be nice. Don't be so afraid.
Oh, I'm fine.
I just wanna kiss, that's all.
No...
Marty...
Okay.
You mustn't feel too harshly against her daughter-in-law. She also wants to have a house to clean and a family to cook for.
You can't just walk off onna girl like that.
Well, at the time she told me this, she already had six. Every time I saw the woman, she was either...
Sure. This girl said...
What girl, what does she know?  Why don't you let her hold the baby once in a while?! Your mother, boy, she wantsa take the kid for a day, that's fine!
Tomatoes.
Marty...
What didn't you like about her?
...I been talking about two nurses Leo and me picked up in a bar on Seventy-First Street.
Waddaya read there, Joe?
The nurses Leo and me picked up last night. We got a date with them tonight.
I can't do that, Ralph, because somebody already brushed her off once tonight.
Oh, Marty, thanks a lot. That really takes a load offa my mind.
I just this minute got the baby to sleep.
She was here, you know, Wednesday, and I said, "Catherine, my sister..."
I just can't stand it any more! Every minute of the day! Do this! Do that! I don't have ten minutes privacy with my husband! We can't even have a fight! We don't have no privacy! Everybody's miserable in our house!
How's Marty been lately, Aunt Theresa?
He's parted his moorings.
I don't think I can give absolution to a man who's about to commit suicide. It's a mortal sin.
What is, Red, the intention or the act?
Just use common sense. Your job is preventing sin, and the way to do that is give him your best Cross Action.
Reckon so, but we been boozing all day and you work up an appetite.
Never this close.
How you, Radar?
That's right.
No.  Or why you should.
Hey, you been sneaking some reading outside the frigging Bible!
Where's he gonna use that kind of talk? 'The valley of the shadow of death.' Wait a minute, Ho-Jon...  I got something for you.
Wisconsin.
Yeah, that's right.  You better get us a chest-cutter before there's trouble.
What do you think, Trapper?
Good thinking, Duke. How about it, Ho-Jon? Can you round up a few of the boys?
A native is someone who is born in a particular place.
An application to Androscoggin College.
Yeah, if I can.
Any time. Whenever we want.
I looked. Suspicious bastards got them all locked up.
It's that disrespect for you, that's what I can't forgive them.
Come clean with us, Frank. Were you on this religious kick back home, or did you start to crack up here on the post?
There's nothing to talk about, General. You take the case yourself or join me at three o'clock. Either way you're liable to learn something.
Well, Dad, we haven't found any holes in the large bowel. They've all been in the small bowel, but the smell is different. I caught a whiff of large bowel, but it ain't staring us in the face, right?
I'm impressed, Pierce. Naturally, the kind of job I have, I don't get much chance to keep up with what goes on in the OR.
I like an olive.
Ho-Jon, give the Father some more martini.
The Painless Pole plans to cross the Great Divide tonight and we need your help to straighten him out.
Your high school friend who went around saying 'Me lay, you lay?' to all the young females in the community. As I remember, you said it was quite a successful approach.
Well, he wouldn't score more than once in seven or eight tries, but the important thing was he didn't waste time socializing. Anyway, Trapper John, this is Me Lay.
Radar!
Never mind the conversation. Do it, Dad.
You aspirate the blood from the chest cavity. Damn, there's more of it than I thought.
But I'm married.
Same here.
It happens to be a matter of life and death.
I'm fond of Painless, and I'd feel terrible if anything happened to him...
I don't liking it at all, what I hear when I listen to the heart. And such a blood pressure for so young a boys. Is frightening.
I'm sorry to hear that. You think he's unfit for military service?
Why would he do that?
The one and only.
Proud to know you, Trapper. Like to shake your hand if you'll hurry up and get that chest closed.  You still working the trains?
What's the story?
Poker sounds great. When do you play?
You've been drawn to other males? Since you were a kid?
You don't have any problem. You've got thirty good years ahead of you, easy. Maybe you'll have to cut down as you grow older, get along with just two fiancees, but...
You guys got any black capsules?
I have not understood what you means.
Finest kind. Captain Forrests say you better haul ass home quick. We got new chest-cutter in our tent.
I'll tell you my news. I'm retiring from football.
I'm afraid so, Colonel.
Yeah?
I been out of action since I got over here five months ago.
The address of the N.E.P.H. and W. Why don't you meet me there when you're through golf for drinks and dinner and whatever strikes the fancy?
Mine's already been struck, and it doesn't have to be very fancy.
No, we had a clear soup to start. This is a thick one and you ought to taste it. There's nothing like it back home.
Now?
Nice.
With all of it?
Yes, you're sore at the world. Come on, now.
Uh-huh . . .
Oh, it started as a circulation stunt, but it isn't any more. Mr. Norton wants to get back of it and sponsor John Doe Clubs all over the country. He wants to send you on a lecture tour.
No, not that bad. It was a fella that sends you flowers every day. Er, what's his name? Mr. Norton's nephew.
Yeah, that's the one.
You were? I thought you were chasing me?
Well, yes, I was. But I was your father then, see?  But the real me, John Doe, er, that is, Long John Willoughby, I was the fellow up there with the book. You know what I mean?
I don't know. About three hundred thousand.
Yes, I did, John. But Iâ€”I had no idea what was going on.
Yes, sir.
Oh, I'm sure I can.
A third party?
John! I'm so glad to see you. Iâ€”I was terribly worried.
Oh, yes you will, Ann dear . . . you're very clever.
Oh, yes, Father certainly would.
There's enough in it for a hundred speeches, things people ought to hear nowadays. You be careful of it, won't you dear?  It's always helped keep your father alive for me.
There is no letter. I made it up.
So?
Yes.  What's he doing here?
Duets? But can we trust him?
I ain't seen him for a week.
Yes, both of 'em! But don't let him out of your sight.
All right. You're walking alongâ€”not a nickel in your jeansâ€”free as the windâ€”nobody bothers youâ€”hundreds of people pass yuh by in every line of businessâ€”shoes, hats, automobiles, radio, furniture, everything. They're all nice, lovable people, and they let you alone. Is that right?
There you are, Boss, just like you ordered. Symbols of the little people.
Well, thank you for listening. Goodbye, Mr. Doe. You're a wonderful man and it strikes me you can be mighty useful walking around for a while.
Five thousand bucks!  I had it right in my hand!
Better make it doughnuts, huh?
Uh-huh. That's exactly what I thought. Beany, go on down to the office, tell Pop to give you the speech. There's a copy on my desk.
Sure.
No.
Well, if there's nobody holding us here, let's get going. Incidentally, my name isn't Doe. It's Willoughby.
It's not a lie! Nickels and dimes! To stuff into their own pockets! You can read all about it in the newspapers there!
Did you write itâ€”or didn't you?
No, I didn't write it, butâ€
Listen, folks, it's a fact that I didn't write the letter, but this whole thing startedâ€
Yep. There was a major league scout there watching me, too. And he came down after the game with a contract. Do you know what?  I couldn't life my arm to sign it. But I'll be okay again as soon as I get it fixed up.
Well, when you get up on the radio, all you have to do is say the whole thing's a frame-up. Make you a hero sure as you're born!
Out the window! Something just flew by!
I didn't see anything.
No, sir.
What's the rush? They haven't killed anybody yet this week?
We don't know how much time we have. If I can get in to talk to him -- maybe we won't lose anyone.
You mean Frank who owns the bakery down the street?
Of course.
This cousin of yours... What's his name?
Are you going to turn on me too? Who helped you when you were strung out? Who gave you money? Who bailed you out of jail?
Tell him what, what do you want me to tell him?
I what?
How about the record room for any incident reports? He might be a victim. We can get medical records. Check with burglary detail and see if anyone else knows him, knows his habits.
That's not going to look too good on your service record.
If you say so.
You're a real excitable sort, aren't you?
Is there something wrong with that?
You could say something like,  "Tell me what the scumbag's name is. Maybe we can work something out."
To save lives.
To run last?
To run late!
Damnit!
I look at it as how many I've saved. That's the way you've got to look at it.
What am I giving up? I'm laid off last year. I'm down to my last unemployment check. I'm out on the streets looking for work and this bitch is banging some asshole in my bed.
What do you want from me?
If you did, you never showed it.
What are you talking about? This is it. This is the stuff right here.  Well, maybe just a pinch more sugar.
Just now.
The hell I am!
Are you going to make this hard for me?
Roper...
Yeah, they are but...
True.
You're in there.  Everybody dies, you go with them --
This is how you pick up women --
No...
Nothing, go back to sleep.
True.  But why?
No.
You are not a God.
In a computer program.
Have the staff apologize profusely and issue credit vouchers.  But remember, it's a capacity problem.  That's all.
Sorry, I just design the maze.  Keeping the keys secure is your job.
-- Yes.
Go!
-- Christoph changed the maze.
To hide the evidence.
There was no need to kill her.
Times Square.
-- The inside?
Not you.  A copy.
Sorry?!
There was no other choice.
Because you'll never believe me.
There?
Just like that --
Resurrection.
Describe program function.
... Perhaps there is a way... I have heard tales of another power.
It will not harm you.
Stylin'!
What's a Triac?
I am the crane, agile and sublime!
NINJA WOLF ZORD!
WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE!!
A stellar idea, Skull.
Tommy, you are the Falcon, Winged Lord of the Sky.
BUT I'M YOUR COUSIN!
GO POWER RANGERS!
Activating Power Scope!
LET'S DO IT!?
NINJA FALCON ZORD!
But I've never served a day.
Boo-Boo.
Whatever you say, Boss.
I came into this world flat on my ass.
And now you have everything.
Mr. Rothstein, Can I be frank? You're a gambler, and I know you've had losses. I also know you could sell to Maranzano or Masseria for fifty G's, but nobody sells to those guys once. So if ya really got another buyer, and ya wanna welch, I ain't gonna beef.
I cannot bear to look at that hideous suit one minute more.
An intelligent plan, Mr. Luciano, but listen to me well. It can be ruined in a single careless moment. Keep your feet on the ground and your high opinion of yourself under your hat.
You havin' any luck findin' out who did him?
But if ya can't catch the guys...
Maranzano. Ta ice you.
That's it.
I thought we just wanted to be left alone to run our business.
For being a bootlegger?
You're sure?
Have you thought about this?
Guess I'm too confused to think.
I'm doin' business here!
It'll all be over tomorrow. No more wars. No more killin'. Just livin' normal like everybody else.  You'll be stuck with me for good.
I don't care what anybody calls me, Joe. Long as it ain't to dirty. And if you fellas get together every year and say, "Charlie, we still want you to run things for us", I ain't gonna insult ya by sayin' no.
Lansky. Meyer Lansky. And that's Bugsy Siegel ya got there.
A million bucks. In the last six months.
So what is the problem?
How soon can we pull this off?
Seein' he loved the experience so much, I think we outta give him the pleasure again.
Maranzano will think Masseria ordered the hit, and won't have no choice but to start the war.
I know. When the storm hits, it don't pay to be caught outside.
Never threaten me, Boss.
How can I trust you when you look at me like that?
You got no fuckin' choice. You might be able to stay alive, but you're never gonna win the war from these fuckin' rat holes.
I must know more of you, my son.
Don, I'd be honored.
The name's Charlie.
I've got friends.
An' Masseria's got seven hundred.
What about the share.
Share with them as you wish. Do business with them on your own. But no filthy Jew will ever be a brother to me.
That's why I'm here.
The guy doin' the job names the price. If you don't like it, you can kill Masseria yourself.
You think this is a coincidence? Next week half your customers will be buying their Scotch, our Scotch, from Maranzano. In a month, he'll be in Scotland talking to my distillers, because you can't move product. I'll be out of business, and you'll be working for Maranzano.
Wanna know what I think?
I'll knock 'em in, Charlie. I can do it. Blow his fuckin' head off. Get rid of the bastard for good.
We can't sell out to those guys. They ain't businessmen!
That's just what they're calling ya pal. Lucky Luciano.
What?
I'm serious. It was bicameral disjunction - right brain and left brain out of balance. He was a rightie, so I made him switch the pencil to his left hand. Just to see what'd come out.
Most we've ever used is half a CC.
Stu Miley.
Three months, Bull. Three months tonight. Three months since the accident - and I'm no closer to going home than I was then.
Well - you'd need a body.
Back? You're sending me back?
Never proven. They're ready to pop for a pre- emptive endorsement. Kids love Burger God -
That's not going to stop his nightmare -
I don't want to <u>stop</u> the nightmare, Hutch. I want to crank it up. I want to take it right off the charts. I want to <u>scare him awake</u>.
Maybe you could talk to Death!
YOU SET ME UP!!
Monkeybone...!?
Home sweet home, huh? Actually, I was expecting something a little swankier. How much loot does old Stu rake in, anyway?
<i></i> In what way?
That was <u>especially</u> Monkeybone. Come on, Doc, I don't want to be stuck here with this bunch of media creeps. I just want to be <u>us</u>. Home. Alone! <i></i> I have something I have to give you.
Yeah, I <u>could</u>, but the thing is, if later got here sooner, it would be...better.
It was great, baby. Let's get you to the ER.
My <u>tail</u> itches.
Yeah. To see if he could expedite my case. But I wait, and I wait, and...I'm starting to think I'll never see her again.
<u>I'll</u> worry about the guards. <i></i> OKAY, STU. SEE YOU IN A DAY OR TWO.
THAT DOES IT! BACK IN THE PACK!
Let's not kick the nice Reaper's ass.
Stu, you have my <u>absolute confidence</u>. Â­- DEAD MAN! DEAD MAN WALKING!!
There's a thing here! There's a switch!
We like to think so, yeah.
That poor boy's a crack dealer from Alphabet City.  We do not allow his kind on this block.
Well, I'd love to see inside your club.
Well, once you're inside, it's nice.
That's New York.  It looks rundown, but it's safe during the day.  You'll get used to it.
But I was dusting.
Oh, it's so nice to meet you.
Mother!
Are you sure you got my bag in?
... Oh ...
... And the children thought I should take a trip.
Nah, not dangerous.  Not that dangerous.  Not during the day.
Yes! This was how I could be put out of the Senate and out of the way! They even *promised* me that if I--
I'll brain that guy! Well--call Paine-- call Saunders--
Okay. For the dollar, I give you McGann *and* Bill and Carl. I got Paine.  Hello... Oh, yes.
You know--Mrs. Diz Moore.
Well, if you're sure it wouldn't--no use combing my hair for nothing.
No--don't do it. I'm sure. The truth is, Diz--there's no man I've seen yet or--must be something wrong with me. I've been feeling low for weeks.
You got worms.
Whadaya mean--*right*?
Certainly.  Now there's the principal actor in our little play.
Paine.
Okay. So what? Stop worrying. I've told you--the dopes are gonna inherit the earth anyway--
"There's more light here," he says--
Yeah. Some of my best friends are funny.
No. How'd you feel? Quick.
I apologize.
Tunnel?
What?
I case you don't know--I want to give ya a chance to back out if you don't like it--
Save that for the laying of cornerstones, Hubert!  Oh, that morning you looked in the mirror and saw a statesman!
Emma, which is it--Horace Miller or Henry Hill?
Good. Are the newspaper men at the hotel?
Oh! Go away.
Horace Mill--!
Jim--the answer to a prayer--manna from heaven--the man *we want*--and the votes *we need*--
Oh--Jim!
Will you please tell me *exactly* what he's done?
--And it is in my power to confer a very signal honor upon you. In my official capacity, therefore, I--
Peter, I'm in no mood to hear childish prattle!
Jeff for Senator.
What? Who?
I know. I suppose, Mr. Paine, when a fellow bucks up against a big organization like that, one man by himself can't get very far, can he?
The *Bills*? Jeff--let me advise you-- as your father would--politics is a business--sometimes a cruel business. In your time here, you couldn't even start on those Bills. They're put together by legal minds--after a long study. Why, after twenty years, I can't understand half of them myself. No, really, Jeff--in your own interests--
What's to stop you? Saunders will help you with it--
I will, sir! I will!  I--I don't know how to thank you. I knew, if any man could help me--
Mr. President--I did not say that Senator Paine was one of those Congressmen I saw. If the chair please, I will deny that Senator Paine *saw* Taylor or even knows him--
The gentleman has said repeatedly that he is speaking to the people of his State. He has been waiting, as he so fancifully puts it, for them to come marching here in droves. Would the gentleman be interested in knowing what those people have to say?
Gosh! You see sir--I was fixing some plaster for a cast on Amos' leg-- he's always chewing 'em off. I'll only be a minute--if you'll excuse me, sir--
Hello, Ma.  Clarissa, Ma. She'll be stayin' a while--
Fine--
You're a liar!
Did you say--bus?
I had a lot to do with that little press conference last night--
I know--but you--you're going to help.
Tonight.  Look--uh--I don't want to seem to be complaining, Senator--but in all civilized countries, there's an institution called *dinner*--!
Committee, huh?
What's that?
Yes. Sure. What's a Steering Committee?
I did--and--and I got right up.
But you've just taken care of the spirit all right.
Baltimore. Pure city-dweller.
Have you always had to--work?
No! Gosh! I better get moving here, Miss Saunders--  Everybody else calls you just plain "Saunders." Why can't I?
Saunders. That's better.  Good morning, Saunders. Hello, Saunders. How's the bill coming, Saunders--?
Abigail.
And a beautiful woman, too--don't you think?
The letters? Gosh--no. I couldn't talk letters. I've gotta scratch 'em out. And say--I'm going to tell Ma all about you. If I tell it right-- the first thing you know you're going to get the best jar of preserves you ever tasted.
Get your hat, Senator. We've got a lot to do between now and tomorrow--
But--I've done everything I--
Jeff--listen--remember the day you got here?--what you said about Mr. Lincoln?--that he was sitting up there--watching--waiting for someone to come along? Well--that was *you*. Someone with a little plain, decent, uncompromising *rightness*--to root out the Taylors--yeah, and really light up that dome for once. This country could use some of that--so could the whole drunken, cockeyed world right now--a *lot* of it! And when the right man comes along--no matter *what* the odds--he can't *ever* quit! A little fellow called David walked out with only a sling- shot--but he had the *truth* on his side--
Goodnight, Senator--
Senator, you can talk all you want to, now.
The Senator will please suspend until order is restored in the chamber.
How's that, buddy?
That's what he's been doing since last heard from.
No?
And I'm an old hand at following instructions--
What are you driving at? You want *me* to get him to sign that?
He's lost complete faith in me--
Do you?
*Me! Me*! I *still* don't see why I should--! If you love him so much, why don't you go to him yourself and-- ? Or better still--get up in that Senate and *fight* for him!
It's too late now--it's *impossible*!
Well, then appoint Miller--if you're sure he'll take orders.
I don't want any part of crucifying this boy.
Congressmen, Radner, Schultz, Diggs--
*I* know what I'm doing! I'll say what I *want*!
Anything *better* to offer?
All right, we'll take Jeff with us--
I present the credentials of Honorable Jefferson Smith who has just been appointed Senator by the Governor of my state.
It was *I* who rose in this Chamber to accuse him. He is saying that I was carrying out criminal orders on falsified evidence--
Will Senator Smith yield to his colleague?
He sure is.
You don't go out with girls very much, do you?
I haven't.
Yes!
NO!!
That's all, Miss Bennett. That's all.
What?
Gosh, you look pretty tonight.
Uh-huh.
Really?
Sure. I can sing "Humoresque."
"Humoresque"? I'll bet you don't even know how it goes.
Let's just walk, okay?
A girl?
He's got goodness, Mabel. Do you know what that is?
You're acting like a school girl.
Listen, Babe - get me some stuff on this guy, and you can haveâ€
Uh-huh.
Good! Good!  Stay there. Don't show your face down here. I'll tell everybody you're on your vacation. They'll never know where the stories are coming from. Stick close to him, Babe - you can get an exclusive story out of him every day for a month. We'll have the other papers crazy.  Babe, I could kiss you!
You'll get it, Babe. You'll get it.
Aw, listen Babe, I can't let you quit now. You're not going through with this thing, are you?
Yes, sir.
Is that the best you've got?
Yeah, that's fine. Have a lot of it because she likes it.
Yes, sir.
They keep insisting they should have some nuisance value.
But it's a great story. Somewhere in this country a guy is walking into twenty million bucks.
It's okay with me as long as my weekly stipend keeps coming in.
How do you do.
He was? Gee, that's too bad. If there's anything I can do toâ€
Who - me? No.
I was wondering where they're going to get another tuba player for the band.
A lawyer representing some woman with a claim against the estate.  Tell him to see me at my office.
No, thanks.
Well, we'd like to find out something about him. What does he do for a living?
Why should you?
He was the last baby my father delivered, Arthur was.
Okay, you're the boss.  When your blood begins to boil, yell out. I'll be seeing you!
No, you don't! Get this clear: Socking people is no solution for anything.
If they're going to poke fun at me, I'm going toâ€
Will you tell the gentleman I'm not in?
Not hungry. I want to get through this work in a hurry, and then I want to go home. What price did you get on those trucks?
I'm Chairman.
That's what I thought. If you don't mind, I'm rather interested in the Treasurer's report. I'd like to hear it.
Naturally.
Why not?
It reminds me very much of this one. Nicht wahr?
Sure - everybody's a moocher to you. A mongrel dog eating out of a garbage pail is a moocher to you!
That's fine. Thanks. I'll look 'em over later.
Yes. Your uncle's common-law wife. She has a legal claim on the estate.
Why, I turned them down, naturally.
Well, I play the tuba.
Not at all.
No.  Yes. There's just one more thing I'd like to get off my chest before I finish.
I'm a writer myself, you know.
Thanks, but Miss Dawson and I are going out to see the sights.
Now you keep out of this!
Sure. They got on my nerves, so I threw 'em out.
It would be a nice night to go for a walk, don't you think?
Yes, sir.
Imagine that - holding the ends of my pants!
I just wanted to make sure.
Miss Dawson, sir? No, sir. No Miss Dawson has called, sir.
You have no pants, sir.
What do you mean by coming in here when I'm playing?
He said he wasn't coming back. He said it wasn't working for him any more. That it hadn't "worked for him" for quite a while... You know what I regret the most? I'm sorry I let him make the kids take his name. He was an acquirer.  He liked to acquire things.
It's my daughter Sofie... she's gotta problem.
That's it -- syndrome. So you know all about it?
No. It's sort of spur of the moment.
You never got back to me.  ...I called to say we'd like to take you out for a meal?... Kind of a professional welcome.
I don't think you know Dr. Sheeler. She's the other therapist here in town.
How do you mean?
And please, for whatever small way I may have encouraged this, accept my apologies.  There is good news, though.
Good, then go.
Mr. Follett.
Not for this. Not me, you're not.
I enjoy it. Does that make me some kind of pervert? Just because a man has a rich imaginative life --
What exactly is it supposed to do?
Mr. Gilroy --
Doc. Nice to meet you.
Fill in the blank. I don't mind the office. The point is, you only go 'round once. Like the Zens say -- Be here now.
You've done well.
She's gone weird is what's wrong with her. Out of control. Probably from living out here in Mayberry.
It's okay. They pre-order. There's a choice of three entrees.
You do?
I think it's like... inquisitive.
Here it is, some advice -- do the hard thing.
Clean up the mess. No matter what it takes.
I just got my license two weeks ago.
You're good.
That would explain it.
Is she a friend of yours?
Do you think that's a good idea?
I think you know what I mean.
I think you do.
Could I see Sofie, please?
No, you can not. I wouldn't know who to say is calling.
Well, I gotta say, Mrs. Cook, you're right about that.
I'd better not, I'll fall right to sleep. I think it's too soon for me to be sleeping with you.
We'll work it out.
Maybe you'll catch it.
What?
Sorry... I'm done.
'Cause I'll tell you, none of the others have tried this approach.
All I have to do is have two conflicting thoughts at the same time... Like I'll think -- 'Taking these walks is going to help Sofie get better.' But then I'll also think -- 'Mumford, you just enjoy taking these walks and you're kidding yourself about the benefits.'
You actually address yourself by name in your thoughts?  So you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage?
Disgusting.
It's pretty obvious to a trained professional.
No, that'd be a good story, but that was just the beginning of the end. We went on for another year or so.
That's one way to put it.
Part of it. We were watching "ER" until someone called.
Will you be here?
Don't do that thing...  ...that shrink thing.
If you don't want to have a session today, it's okay.
What happened today?
Was it something that happened at school?
Uh-huh.
What'd he say?
Really?
I'm impressed. I couldn't make three million dollars if I lived three lifetimes.
This is exactly what I wanted.
Lily and I talk a bit. You know Lily, runs the coffee shop?
Did you know that Danny Ainge was drafted by the Blue Jays? Do you know what kind of athlete you have to be to play in the NBA and in the bigs?
Yeah.  Guy's got some serious sex fantasies.
That's all right. What's on your mind?
You're concerned that maybe I can't be trusted with a secret.
-- Skip. Knowing what you do about me --
Doc, I trust you! You've listened to me better than anybody... maybe ever.  And this secret I've got, I can't stand it anymore. I don't know if I'm some kind of --
Okay... let's say that, for now.
No, Doc, a private secret! It's perverted, it's pitiful. What am I -- Dr. Frankenstein? Aren't you repulsed?
An IRS investigator with a drug problem?
Hey, you've done good. Look at yourself... you've cleaned up, you've got a career --
Doc, there's something about what you told me the other night I can't get out of my head. It's driving me batty --  Why me? How did you know you could trust me?
Yep.
Lots of institutions. My graduate advisor believed we should experience as many environments as possible -- prisons, clinics, half-way houses. For a while I was chief therapist in a shopping mall. Had a little spot next to the yogurt place.
I got caught robbing a synagogue. Lots of good stuff in them holy places; churches, temples, mosques, and who's guarding them?
Altar boys?
'Cause I look good doin, it.
What are you looking for? Lie, and I'll slit your throat.
I would pay one hundred pounds just to see him hang.
What are you doing here?
No, I mean --
Really want to know?
Twenty-five percent, and not one single farthing more.
Trust me.
Preparation for what?
Something like that.
Why would I do that?
Forget it, we're out the door down the hall and gone.
No, we are not.
There goes that belief again. Not me, I am outta here!
The creature!? Are you sure!?
Personally, I think he's filthy, rude and a complete scoundrel. I don't like him one bit.
I only gamble with my life, never my money.
Yes, awfully tempting, wasn't it?
What are you going to do? Shoot him?
Rat gizzards. They smell bad and taste worse, but that's the best the desert has to offer.
And then he'll be coming after Evy.
And now he's going to use it to bring his girlfriend back
I guess you know just about everything, don't you, Lance?
I was eight.
And I'm gonna nip it in the bud.
Captain who?
Really?
Just a waitress.
Why not?
You're a spy.
I get off work in fifteen minutes. Walk me home?
So you're chicken?
Normal. What's normal? Does normal exist? And if it did, how would we know it?
So you're like... struggling superheroes?
And why are you wearing that silly costume?
Because... I'M A SUPERHERO!
I always knew that you were special.
Definitely.
The who?
May the forks be with us!
Well, one thing immediately comes to mind, if what you are saying is true -- he would merely withdraw his army from Moscow and return to Poland for the winter.
Whatever suggested the idea to you?
Is this enough to oppose 40,000 men?
In every practical sense, yes, but, officially, of course, I would have to retain command.
What cowardice!  What treason! Joseph has ruined everything.  How could they all lose their heads. They knew I was coming up fast. Victory was just within grasp. Come, come, turn your troops around, General Belliard.
Ah, my poor Josephine.  She was the most alluring, most glamorous creature I have ever known -- a woman in every sense of the word, and she had the kindest heart in the world.  She may have been a liar and a spendthrift, but she had something that was irresistible -- she was a women to her very fingertips... How impossible it is to believe that she is dead.
Yes, sire?
You will return to Paris tomorrow and you will carry my compliments and thanks to General Le Clerc for assigning such an excellent officer to carry out a responsibility which has meant so much to myself and to Madame Bonaparte.
Thank you, sir.  I will do that.
How did it spread so quickly?
From what we can tell, there are hundreds of agents, all over the city.  The combustibles seem to have been carefully placed beforehand, and all the fire-engines have been removed from the city.
Ah, good evening, my dear Duroc. I'm afraid I've been out hunting and I have had a rather bad fall.
That is correct.
Well, then, you have a lot of initiative, my young friend.
Then what brings you out on such a night?
No, I'm only here on leave.  My regiment is at Valence.
I know of no better time.
The comedy of my marriage is sufficiently well known already.
It is time to clarify the situation. Everything is over between us.
But you can do the same thing in six months.  The next few weeks may be the most important ones in your life.
My mind is made up.  She will not set foot in my house again.  I think if I saw her again, I might be tempted to strangle her.
Are you trying to insult me?
I am delighted to be of service to you again, Your Highness.  And I can tell you, my instructions came directly from the Emperor, with a caution to be discreet.
And, you seem in excellent health, Your Highness.
Oh, I don't want to put you to any inconvenience.
I don't care, but promise you will never leave me.
Go away -- I'm busy.
Oh -- now, this is absolutely ridiculous!  If you don't want to be humiliated in front of your guests, you will return to the table at once.
But you will not... be safe...
Well, maybe he's only looking out for your best interests.
Well, whatever the hell you wanted to do, you are going to tell me everything right now.  Do you understand?!
What was there to tell?
Yes, my dearest Marie-Louise, I am your husband.
Ah, you must forgive me, my dearest Marie-Louise, I saw it during one of my stays at your palace -- at Schonbrunn.
Of course, my dear -- how cruel to have been separated from her.  And how strange it must be for you to be here, away from your family and everything you know.
Well, two nice little Swiss boys, who are virgins, decide they will save up their money and go to a bordello.
Those are extremely harsh terms.
We have a treaty with Austria.
Not one I should like to rely on. Francis is still smarting under the terms he had to accept after Austerlitz, and he is under great pressure to recover his losses.
Very well, Citizen Lieutenant.  You have come to the right place, for I am Citizen Varlac.
Yes, sir.
It will scarcely be considered credible, perhaps, but our whole business consisted in eating cherries together.
That's it?
If you see that boy again, bite off his ear off like Mike Tyson.
Never...  But me and Suga can get real nasty in that Jacuzzi, though.
Don't move me.
Ain't the rest room this way?  I gotta pee.
Shut up!  Fo' I pump this Glock in yo' ass!  What did you do wit Day-Day and Roach?
I know, we had a good time.  But ever since you guys moved out here, it seems like we've lost touch.
Yeah, that's me.  Just a little somethin' somethin' I picked up.
You got a restraining order on a little girl named Baby D?
Why?
Okay, plan B.
Fuuuuuuck -- U!
Out the door and to the left.
I didn't see nothing.
I don't know, and it could be anything. But I just say we go take a look.
The bubble guts.  I'm so nervous it feels like I'mma shit on myself.
What about me?
I will.  When can I come visit?
Oh yeah, why you walking?
What you mean, you don't know?  Just wait here.
Hell yeah, I remember you.
I'm sorry for what my brother did this morning.  They're assholes.
I'm sorry to hear that.
It's locked.
Ya'll making me look like a punk.
I do.
What up, bro?
You damn right that's the big one.
Negative...they vamped.
Maybe you can ask him to loan you the money.
Where's Craig?
Ya'll live around here?
I don't know.
Bite his ear!
He's a boy, dude.
Thanks for the help.
Hey, man, the pleasure's all mine. Thanks for the dog, and the money.  Maybe my dad won't kick my ass tonight.
Okay, later, bro.  Hey, Craig, nice smokin' wit'cha.
20 minutes?
Alright, no problem.  We gone.
Man, we can't ride to Rancho Cucamonga on that.
I don't know.
Willie, shut up.  Yo' old ass need to get in a little bit o' trouble sometimes.
I threw my back, again.
Aw, no lovin' tonight?
Business or pleasure?
Aw, too bad.
I saw her die. She was shot. With this gun.
I'd prefer we didn't refer to it as my last speech.
Believe me, I don't blame you.  This is the Governor, Lynn. Say hello.
Yes. It's OK, Lynn. These are our friends.
I will do no such thing.
At one thirty my little girl is dead.
Where did you get these? Who are you?
I kill her - and you kill me.
Don't you threaten me.
Trust me. You asked me for help. Let me help. Trust me.
No way.
I'm tired. I want to.go now.
All right. Kisses to you.
Don't denigrate yourself, my friend. Where would the government be without accountants?  They wouldn't know how hard they can squeeze us before we pop, isn't that right?
What's that? You have to speak up.  I'm a little deaf in this ear. Between that and my wooden leg I'm a mess. Compliments of the United States Army Artillery Corps.
What?
What are you going to do?
Thank you.
I don't want my windshield cleaned.
It's already done. I've already done it. You have to pay me now.
Gimme a dollar.
He got onto the pool deck with a gun. How did he get past her Security carrying a
You have, huh?
You ask too many questions. You want the surprise or not?
Help me get her off the rug.
Come with me, honey.
No.
He carried on some; kicked.
How come you got that stickknife hid in your bed-blankets, Preacher?
How's your sister Pearl?
There hain't nary hook in the land smart enough to hook Mister Gar. What a feller needs is mother-wit -- and a horse-hair.
Yes! Yes!
But which one of you can say as I can say: I drove a good man to murder because I kept a-houndin' him for clothes and per-fumes and face paint!
So you ain't with the State no more?
Mother, I only --
Now ain't you relieved, Walt?
Twenty-five wives!
I declare, you'll let that money haunt you to your grave, Willa Harper!
She'd found this fruit jar of dandelion wine  that the husband -- Harper -- had hid somewheres in the cellar.  She was drinking.
I know you did, Reverend. Oh, I know how you tried!
The devil wins sometimes!
Thank you, no. Thank you, dear Icey. I'll tend to them. Thank you.
Who's them Blue Men yonder?
Why?
No, that's just it. No.
We'll steal somethin' to eat.
A feller can't just go around with run-down, busted watches.
In the cellar. Buried under a stone in the floor.
Yes?
Tst-tst! Then I reckon I'll have to try again! Where's the money hid?
Why, sure. And there's fried chicken and candied sweets and cornsticks and apple cobbler!
Yes. But first of all we'll have a little talk.
No.
Only she won't never let me play with it.
The first night?
She turned me out of the bed.
Ben never told you he throwed it in the river? Did he?
When did I ever?
He must have wanted somethin', Ruby. A man don't waste time on a girl unless he gets something.
Jesus.
Glen. Not now. I mean, we're here for Tina now, not for ourselves.
Slept like a rock.
You believe in the Boogey Man?
Uh-oh...
No.
I guess those people don't wake up to tell what happens.
Oh. Hi, how y'doing?
Dad, I want to see Rod Lane.
Sure, but...
Krueger.
Keep your head -- this is a fucking flesh and blood killer we're talking about.
No, Mother. Yes, Mother. No, Mother.
Nancy!
S'curity.
Go on...
He doesn't know you.  Couldn't you change?
The door was locked from your side.
Good. No more nightmares for either of us then.
Too bad... you missed an inspiring day, Anna.
You know how it is today... all you have to do is wear a pair of silk stockings and they suspect you of counter-revolution.
Just for the honeymoon.
...and little Lady Beatrice?
Or it might be the firing squad!
We'll just say we had to take it on account of the safe. That's a perfect excuse. There was no other safe big enough.
How many families live here with you?
Very good. The last mass trials were a great success. There are going to be fewer but better Russians.
Do you spell Buljanoff with one or two f's?
But, Comrades...
Very well, Your Highness.
Ah, there's something poetic about the simple processes of labor. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet... it should be set to music!
We avoided luxury and extravagance and today... well, if you were to offer us a glass of champagne, we wouldn't say no.
...Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves... into one single hour you can crowd a thousand and one nights.
Get out of here!
Don't look so gloomy, gentlemen. All is not lost. You may have a chance.
Razinin, Board of Trade, Moscow.
No, no.
I am Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.
Comrade Kopalski...
We can't... but you are so ingenious, Leon...
Yes, there's no doubt of that...  Just look out of the window and there it is.
We will get that... we'll get everything... maybe a little bit later but we'll get it... We must be patient... Finally we got the spring, didn't we? We got the swallows, and you will get your apfel strudel too.
Business.
Confess what?
Now look here... you advertise all over the world that you want people to go into your country and when someone tries to get in, you keep him out!
What for... why?
That's funny. It's interesting. I never gave it a thought before.
In other words you don't know.
A Russian! I love Russians! Comrade... I have been fascinated by your Five- Year Plan for the past fifteen years!
Yes, very strange.
You must admit that this doomed old civilization sparkles... It glitters!
I see a house that looks like any other house. What's remarkable about it?
Is that customary?
That is why I believe in the future of my country.
Wounded? How?
Poor Ninotchka. Poor, poor Ninotchka.
You're the most adorable cog I ever saw in my life. Ninotchka, Cogitska, let me confess something. Never did I dream I could feel like this toward a sergeant.
That's the way a clock works. There's nothing wonderful about it. You merely feel you must put yourself in a romantic mood to add to your exhilaration.
But one of your friends may be in need of you. You must answer.
Ninotchka, you can't walk out like this... I'm crazy about you, and I thought I'd made an impression on you. You liked the white of my eye.
Send me a plate of raw carrots and beets, beets predominating on a ratio of sixty-forty... What? There is a strike in the kitchen? Good! Will you assure the strikers of my hearty sympathy in their cause. I hope they will not weaken in their demands and tell them to put no dressing whatsoever on my vegetables... What? You won't serve me either? Now look here, Comrade, I think it is a fine idea to let the capitalists go without luncheon but when you keep food away from me you're weakening the people.
Then how did you get here?
I always eat here.
Must one always be after something?
But you have now, and I know now that you are a man who employs business methods which in Russia would be punished by death.
On which boat?
I've never been here before. I wonder whom you're thinking of. Oh, I know, a girl with a map, figuring out each step, worrying about north and south. Today... now this might shock you... I went up to a taxi and said "Eight Rue du Bois"... and here I am.
A wonderful idea! Radio or records?
Ninotchka, I love you.
You must, darling.
To the loveliest story I ever heard.
Comrades! Good people of France!
All right, we'll make it red.
And we won't stretch up our arms...
Let's turn on the radio.
No, no news. We don't want to know what's happening in the world. We want to be left alone, don't we?
Yes, sweetheart... all by ourselves.
Now, darling, don't get impatient, wait until we are married. You know that worthless butler of mine... that reactionary? Some day when I come home to you I may say, "Darling, I drove Gaston to the market and look what I got from him!"
Thank you, Leon... thank you, masses.  Can I make a speech now?
So -- you're behind all this. I should have known.
The one I got they wouldn't let me read.  It began, "Ninotchka, my darling," and ended, "Yours, Leon."
Don't you find that restful?... Why didn't you come last night?
Darling, I was busy looking out for your interests.
Now listen, Swana... I sold Monsieur Guizot the idea of publishing your memoirs in the Gazette Parisienne. "The Life and Loves of the Grand Duchess Swana of Russia"!
Darling, this would be wonderful! Just once... weren't you attacked by a Bolshevik?
Huh?
Don't tell me the bed has lost its best friend.
Darling, you're taking my business affairs far too seriously. Much as I'd love to rob the Bolsheviks of their filthy money, I won't do it at the expense of your health. Particularly as we know we won't get much.  You look so pale... pale but interesting.
Oh, please, Swana! I don't know whether I'm standing on my head or my heels. Here you are blaming me for neglecting you when I'm trying to concentrate on another woman and can't get near her.
Is this your new dress suit?
No... please...
I'm the one who should apologize. I should have talked to you before.
I'm afraid that's what it is.
Dear me... I must be losing my finesse. If I'm not careful I'll be understood by everybody.
Exactly. You see, it would have been embarrassing for people of my sort to wear low-cut gowns in the old Russia. The lashes of the Cossacks across our backs were not very becoming, and you know how vain women are.
What?
Leave? That's exactly what I came here to ask you to do. Leave! I don't mean this hotel and I don't mean Paris... I mean France. There's a plane for Moscow at five-forty.
Don't worry. I have already made reservations. It's perfect flying weather. They assure me there's a fine tail wind which will sweep you back to Moscow in no time.
You were very careless with our precious jewels, my dear. They're too expensive a toy for two children to play with.
Won't it be rather embarrassing for a Soviet Envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them?
In other words moral ideas have no weight with you... all right, then let's deal with legal facts. You know that France has recognized the Soviet.
My lawyer agrees with you. He says France will uphold it in every court, but I will drag you through every court, don't forget that. And when I say it will take two years I am, as always, conservative.
That's marvelous.... You must have worked day and night.... Don't you ever sleep?
Well, Comrade, have you heard from your friends Kopalski, Buljanoff, and Iranoff?
As soon as our representatives go to a foreign country they seem to lose all sense of balance. If I told you what's going on in Constantinople right now you wouldn't believe it. Those three have been sitting there for six weeks and haven't sold a piece of fur.  This anonymous report was sent me. They are dragging the good name of our country through every cafÃ© and night club. Here...  "How can the Bolshevik cause gain respect among the Moslems if your three representatives, Buljanoff, Iranoff, and Kopalski, get so drunk that they throw a carpet out of their hotel window and complain to the management that it didn't fly?"
My jewels?!
But sir, we'll have to start over from the beginning.  We don't have the staff to ...
We could get that.
Sir, I still don't think, uh, we can contain it anymore.  There's a cancer on the presidency.  And it's growing. With every day that ...
You do it.
Sure, they did stuff, but nothing like this, Bob.  Forget Watergate, the break-ins, the Enemies list.  You got an attempted firebombing at the Brookings Institution, planting McGovern stuff on the guy that shot Wallace, trying to slip LSD to Jack Anderson.
Christ, we created Frankenstein with those fucking Cubans.
Is it legal?  I mean has anyone ever done it before?
In hiding.  He sent Liddy to talk to me.
Sir, Bob and I are gonna have to testify before Earvin's committee.
No, you're not!  You're going to claim executive privilege and you're going to stonewall it all the way -- plead the Fifth Amendment.  I don't give a shit.  They can't force the President's people to testify.
You know, Al, men in your profession ... you give 'em a pistol and you leave the room.
Let 'em try!  I appointed three of those bastards!  I'm not giving 'em my tapes!
For what?!
I'm afraid we have another problem, Mr. President.
Lincoln used it.
That was civil war.
Three days before, on the June twentieth tape -- the one with the eighteen-minute gap --
It's gone.  No one will ever find out what's on it.
Their fourth!
Our own intelligence capability -- to fix the leaks?
But, sir, you're covered -- no one here gave orders to break into the damned Watergate.  We're clean.  It's only the Ellsberg thing, and if that comes out, it's "national security."
No, keep Trini out of this. Chotiner's too old.  And for God's sake, keep Colson out.  It's time to baptize our young counsel.  That means Dean can never talk about it.  Attorney-client privilege.  Get to it.  And Dean -- you stay close on this.
It's got nothing to do with justice. It's national security.
Yeah, but Roselli wasn't just any gangster.  He was the gangster who set up Track 2 in Cuba.
Because ... because Dick Helms knows too much ... If anyone in this country knows more than I do, it's Hoover and Helms!  You don't fuck with Dick Helms!  Period.
You never told him?
Sir?
These kids are being manipulated by the Communists.  Like Chambers and Hiss.
Probably flunking, nothing to do except come down here and meet girls. Henry's out there with them.
... "The Beast."  A nineteen-year-old kid.  She understands the nature of "the Beast."  She called it a wild animal.
This could be it ... this could be it. Four long years ...
... worrying whether someone said something "nice" about them.  All short-term, frivolous bullshit; Ben Bradlee worrying about Teddy Kennedy liking him ...
It's Helms -- it's got to be.
He'll give us the documents.  But I think he should be offered the ambassadorship to Iran.  Then he'll go without a whimper.
No ...
Did he have to die for me to get it?!
What'd you say?
I'd rather get a whipping than have another talk with her.  Anything but a talk with her.
My friends call me "Mister President."
Current levels may not be sufficient.
Firing you, Mr. Helms, wouldn't do any good.  Of course you'll continue as DCI.  You're doing a magnificent job.
I don't think we can treat this as a formality.  Mr. Kennedy made a verbal promise to the Russians not to invade Cuba.  But you authorized Dr. Kissinger to put this in writing.
How about you?  Are you going to win?
I know you've been very careful not to.  That's why I'm concerned.
The old queen did it on purpose.
She's quite pretty.
Here, Tim ... Tim.  I'm as frustrated as you, Henry, but don't you think this one's a Democrat problem.  They started the war; it makes them look bad.
There's no other choice.
We have to entertain the possibility ...
Not at all.  This is not going to leak, is it?
Of course.
Yes, Mr. President.
We let you down, didn't we.  Your people.
That was Mr. Kennedy.
When they know you've got something to protect, that's when they fuck you!
It wasn't your fault.  The soldiers were just kids, too.  They panicked.
You're doing the right thing, Dick ... don't let 'em shake you.
I wanna fight just as dirty as he does.
Right, right.  I used to play a little ball myself at Whittier.  Of course, they used me as a tackling dummy.
Oh yeah ... she really is ... wholesome.
Of them.
Now some people, we both know them, Al, think you can go stand in the middle of the bullring and cry, "Mea culpa, mea culpa," while the crowd is hissing and booing and spitting on you.  But a man doesn't cry.  I don't cry.  You don't cry ... You fight!
Well, we could delete it.
Maybe I should get out of the game. What do you think, Buddy?  Go back to being a lawyer and end up with something solid, some money at the end of the line ... You know, I keep thinking of my old man tonight.  He was a failure, too.
You're not a failure, Dick.
I want a divorce.
He doesn't want me at the funeral.
They've lost a brother.  You know what that means, Dick.
You should be going ... the primaries are soon, aren't they?  New Hampshire ...
I need you out there.  It won't be like last time.  The war's crippled the Democrats.  I can win ... We deserve it.  Yeah, it's ours, Buddy -- at last.  Nobody knows better than you.  Frank Nixon's boy.
Then what are you scared of, honey?
Hiding what?
Thank you.
There'll be time for that.
How come're you doin that?
Not hardly nothin' in her room. And that establishment was no stickler on registration. Well...
Try "old" on for size.
He can take all comers.
Yessir. We should a brought wieners.
What calibers you got there, Sheriff?
Well I don't either!
What do you think.
I mean, would you care to join me.
No. But I gave my word.
You gave your word?
I don't say anything. Except it was foreseen.
Llewelyn!
Yeah.
What're you doin', baby?
Things happened. I can't take 'em back.
I got a bad feelin', Llewelyn.
Mama's gonna raise hell.
Yes ma'am?
What makes you say that?
I know where it's going to be.
Did you not hear me? We can't give out no information.
You expect him?
You know she won't be there.
This. And the gas.
Didn't mean nothin'.
Sir?
Why would you be comin' back? We'll be closed.
You live in that house behind the store?
Yes I do.
You married into it.
The most. You ever lost. On a coin toss.
Yes you did. You been putting it up your whole life. You just didn't know it. You know what date is on this coin?
No.
Nineteen fifty-eight. It's been traveling twenty-two years to get here. And now it's here. And it's either heads or tails, and you have to say. Call it.
Sir?
Okay.
Yessir. I understand that.
That's not an answer.
I'd just like to know your opinion of him. In general. Just how dangerous is he?
I'm retired.
Any of it. If it can be welded I can weld it.
It's fine. Mind your own meal...
And you should keep your nose out of another man's omelette...  It's no big deal, Betty.
Mind your own business. You just said that shit so you could look at her a little longer, anyway...
I can't... they prefer a more formal presentation. I don't usually go so close to the surface, but I was...
You need to get yourself gone from my crime scene. And leave Betty alone, she's...
You bet I did. I got a squad car on the way to the reservation right now.
A woman can write a check.
That's it! YOU'RE GONE!
That's right, you have the right to remain silent.
I'd like to apologize for our local boy. He's been in love with Betty since the fifth grade, y'see. He means well, but he's in over his head on this.
We think we know where Betty is.
That's a nice name for what you need...
I dunno. Job satisfaction, I guess...  How's things at the Tip Top?
'Kay, good. Bye, then...
Wait, Betty... you still haven't answered me.
I'd rather not...
I don't think I am.
Honey, I'm really sorry, I was gonna call you about tonight. Larry's got a lodge meeting. There's no way I can get a sitter this fast.
No... what about your sister?
Well, you are.
Sue Ann, I'm sorry about all this, but I just know there's something special out there for me...
Betty! Listen to me! Del is ...
No, Del.
You never gave us a chance...
She told me I was charming and relentless, and would go far in this town. And she said that unlike the other charming, relentless people she knew, she liked me.
At last! I know how much you want this. You're gifted and extremely determined, but... it's not up to me.
...but I love listening to you, so that's okay...
Thanks. But I'd like to hear what you're feeling...
Well, I just feel that life'll be much sweeter for you now with me around. I promise...
Ad lib?
All right, then. Actually, I'm glad you're going out. I got something going on tonight. Some serious clients, with real potential.
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
You sure don't. Who do you think you are coming to Hollywood, anyway? You should remember where you came from. And who you really are.
Thanks, Roy, you're sweet... a big liar, but sweet. I liked your editorial this morning...
I'm great, good, content.  What happened to your arm, Roy?
Oh, nothing, it's fine. I just need to keep it wrapped for a few...
I s'pose his name's David Ravell.
You take care of yourself then, Betty, and don't let anybody stop you...
ARE YOU CRAZY?!! STOP IT!!!
Ummm... no, no. Different 'Ravell.'
What are you talking about? This bar is packed with professional people!  Everybody says if you're going to get married, this is the spot to meet someone... Luckily, I'm currently off men, so I've got the luxury of not giving a shit.
Had. She died in a car accident last year. She was decapitated.
God, that's awful!
Rosa, I can't believe you're doing all this for me... thank you.
HE IS REAL!!
To a party in the Hollywood Hills.
Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients, the hospital?
All the time. It's always "Loma Vista" this, "Loma Vista" that.
I'm going back to... I need to... I don't know.
Your husband?!
I'm not some snot-nosed resident fresh out of medical school, Blake.
Deranged. That would be the right word.
Are you kidding me? What's to like?
It's a small town, man. I never should have left Omaha. People here think small. They act small. They're a bunch of dumb fucks.
I'm asking you for an example of one of these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck.
Like what?
I'm just curious. Can't you give me an example?
I wanted to make a statement.
Let me tell you something. In our business you can't put food on the table if your phone doesn't ring. The guys who get the calls are good -- not flashy, just good. They get in, they get out. Nobody knows a goddamn thing. Understand? Boom, boom, boom. Three in the head and you know they're dead.
Well, I should be in FLORIDA now! If Carl hadn't gone in to get those stones removed, you wouldn't be here and I'd be on my way to the Keys. On my boat, RELAXING WITH A GLASS OF PORT!! Re-ti red!
You know, blonde, thin, whatever...
It's a very moving experience, trust me.
Do you hear yourself right now...? Like a fucking madman...
Wait, wait, wait a minute... that doesn't make sense.
Fuck the profile! That's the same guy!!
...but that's not what we're gonna do, is it?
You better believe it.
"Injuns?"
You fucked it up. Who wouldn't freeze in those circumstances? And I don't care what her problems are. She wouldn't be the first one in that cast with problems. We have nothing to lose by making her an offer.
Damn, that's sweet...  She really that good-looking in person?
Sure.
Because it ain't natural, young man.
You'd like that wouldn't you? You've hated Betty since you were in Pep Squad together...
Yeah. Why, you know him?
So tell her to settle for the old one in Orange County.
I don't think she will. She's a slut, but I just don't think she's that mean. Jasmine'll bring her around...
Mr. Campbell?
Huh?
Fire! I hate fire!
I thought you said you were innocent a those charges.
Pull over, Everett - let's give that colored boy a lift.
Well if that is Pete I am ashamed of him.  The way I see it he got what he deserved - fornicating with some whore a Babylon.  These things-
Well that's right! If then! Believe me, Delmar, Woman is the most fiendish instrument of torture ever devised to bedevil the days a man!
Aw, don't be ignorant, Delmar. I told you they was gonna flood this valley.
Aw, honey, our ring is just a old pewter thing -
But I don't mind telling you, I'm awful pleased my adventuring days is at an end...
I said I thought it was in the rolltop desk.
Or in my chiffonier. I don't know.
A 9,000-hectacre lake, honey.
So I borrowed it till I did know!
Pete, don't be ignorant-
Aw, that's all right.
I cain't help it, but that's a wonderful thing to say!
But... but...
I couldn't wait two weeks! She's gettin' married tomorra!
They cut a record in here, few days ago, old-timey harmony thing with a guitar Accump-accump-uh-
Hot damn, we gotta find those boys! Sign 'em to a big fat contract! Hell's bells, Mr. Lunn, if we don't the goddamn competition will!
Blooey!
Fuck, no! Why would I care about something as dumb as that?
From you, pard? Never. Thanks for the graduation present.
Great. You can go in my place.
Hey, did you hear? Sands and Kantrowitz DORed last night.  Survival of the fittest.
I thought I recognized the work.  Be proud of those wings. They're the only ones you're gonna leave here with, Mayo-naise.
Sir, that's not true! I love my country!
What is it, the kicks? Is that it?
Maybe there's hope for you yet.
Pardon?
Fall out on the lawn in five minutes, in your Poopie suits!
Louder!
Vietnam?
How late?
Come on. Let's go dance.
Great.
Yeah... Mmmm...
No more backward, if you ask me, than the way these hotshot assholes fuck us, then ditch us.  Don't you ever feel used, Paula? Don't you ever feel like if this is all you get for your trouble then the sonofabitch ought to be paying for it...?
Already come and gone. Can you believe it? He DORed in the twelfth week. How can you win?
And you turned him down??
Yeah. We've lived all over the world. Katmandu, Moscow, Nairobi.
Just think 'I'm gonna do it!' Program yourself. See yourself making it. It'll happen. I know 'cause I just read this article in Cosmo, and it was about that very thing.
Me, too.
My kinda group!
He didn't give you much choice.
You're better than candy.
I'll get it if you want.
Who says I'm not going after what I want? My mother's thirty-nine years old and she still works in that factory. Every time I see her, I know exactly what I don't want.
Zack, I don't know if I want to do that...
No, it's okay. It was a great free meal. Everybody was so uptight I felt sorry for you.
That's okay. I'm used to it.
Twenty-two years ago.
No wonder he was looking at me like that.
I'm not playing any games! Go look at Lynette's!
Come on, Paula! You were looking for a ticket out of here and you didn't care who it was, any more than you cared with the last class of candidates you and Lynette fucked your way through, looking for a husband! Or the class before that!
He said he grew up poor?
I've seen better.
Sure it is, Sweet Pea, but he should've warned you 'scuzzy' female types about the 'Puget Dudes.' They'll tell you they're wearing a rubber but they've bit a little hole in the end.
A little.
That's what they want you to think, but I saw where she lived, what is she's trying to get away from.  Just take my word for it, pard. Break it off now. Do it this week.
I'm not your folks, man. You love this... Susan?
She said it was up to me. If I don't, she'll go off and have the baby on her own somewhere.
Yes.
You got an idea?
Yeah.  She can.  She's fine, she's just like, tired, she's gotta rest. You rest, Kid.  Half an hour.
It's not her fault, it's not her fault, the guy must have called them.  Look, look, look, she's telling us.
She better.
That's why the key didn't work, they changed the locks.
Daddy's not coming back, she's in the middle of a divorce, it's just the two of them.  We're okay, here.  We can do this, right?
Okay, fuckball, you think.  What are we gonna do?
I did.
Jesus, what was I thinking?
I don't get it.
No ball, kid.
It's just the woman and the kid?
I don't know.  Rob us.  I don't know.
Huh uh.
"Get the fuck out of my house."
I'm here.  I'm here.
Dot dot dot, dash dash dash, dot dot dot.
Where'd you learn S.O.S.?
Come on, come on...
No.
Yes, no, I don't know, do 'em all!
On it!
Stop it.
I'm sorry.
Oh, you know, it's uh... it's in the little fridge in your room.
Okay.
Uhh... I with it sister but...
You gotta. You gotta stay alive. You know what they were trying to do here. You got the pigs dead to rights. It's like Huey said, you're more important than any of us.
What are doing with yours?.
Well as the Rev says, God helps those who help themselves.  We'll be our own stoplight.
What's up?
Yeah you do. It's up to you either here or downtown.
Spontaneous my ass!! You told the press and you don't tell me. Remember you're working for us.
Who fucking cares? You cops killed Cy. And before you bastards kill anyone else, I'll give you your fucking set up. That make you happy??!!
Mothafuck... Hey!!! What the hell!!!
Shit, I ain't doing nothing. White bread asks for cocaine, I take his money. Shit... you know... It was just a hustle.
Man, fuck you!!!
Neither your stomach or your opinion matters here Dorsett... What matters is that Mr. Trafficante and the Bureau have come up with a solution to our Panther Problem. One might say...The Final Solution.
Yeah... Bobby you gotta...
Alone...
Look... can we deal with this tomorrow... I'm tired...
No thank you sister.  Six?!! That seems a little light. Cops are watching Betty, watching her hard. We need at least twenty men. And that's twenty armed Panthers dig? You do have guns don't you?
Don't I know it. Every brother I knew in 'Nam's dead. My company... a land mine. Twenty of my friends dead in less than a second.
Right on Brother Judge...
I don't know about that.
Chickenshits, they're grabbing at anything.
Brimmer.
And you're gonna do just that. But I'll tell you what to feed the pig. You alright with this?
Yeah... I guess. Any of other Panthers know about this?
Yeah well, they want a lot for their money. They want a felony, preferably with "violent intent." We've got to give them something. They'll kill me if I don't. And the Panthers are going to kill me if I do. I'm scared.
What you see is what you got.  That's' Bobby Seale.
Maybe...
Mothafucker! You just set Bobby Seale up to be kidnapped. They dragged him off to some bullshit conspiracy trial in Chicago. How much the pigs pay you for this one, Judge? 
Look... You... take her and get the hell out of here. I'll keep 'em busy.
It was Sabu killed Cy.
Ain't no one seen him.
Didn't want folks to think I was a snitch. You know?
No.
Late summer.
I... uh... that wasn't me, it was Samuel... I mean Nathan...
I've just been inside the mind of a genius.  Lord Cornwallis knows more about war than I could in a dozen lifetimes.
His victories at Charleston and Camden were perfect, strategically, tactically, logistically.  But he has a weakness.
You couldn't have known.
Goodbye.
First Virginia Regulars under Colonel Hamilton.
With a lace table cloth?
Apology accepted.  Now, on the matter of the specific targeting of officers during engagements, this is absolutely unacceptable.
I beg to differ.  One is a command decision on your part.  The other represents nothing more than the occasional over-exuberance of field officers attempting to carry out their duty in difficult circumstances.
As long as your soldiers attack civilians, I will order the shooting of your officers at the outset of every engagement.  And my men are excellent marksmen.
Probably.
Thank you.  How's the spotted one's milk?
The middle colonies?
And the Governor?
It's safer if we stay together.
Is that so?
Yes...  ... father.
God help us all when you're forty.
Pride is his weakness.
Full sentences.  As if she had been speaking all along.
Tell me what everyone doesn't know.
Thirteen years...
Balderdash!
That's five, keep going...
We saw.
I begged him to stay in the cover of the trees but he insisted the only way to break Cornwallis was muzzle- to-muzzle.  He spent too many years in the British army.
So you're going to try to keep Cornwallis in the South until then.
Two.  Gabriel and Thomas.
They're gone.  And there is nothing you or I can do to bring them back. But there is something you can do to help end all this.
Goodbye, Harry.
I lost another a year ago, Thomas. He was only fifteen.
Thank you.  Did you finish the upper field?
Is that right, dad?
Who is this Paxcow? Is he like the boogeyman?
Anyone who can scream that loud isn't ready for intensive care just yet-- looks like she just skinned her knee.
Missy Dandridge. And she says it's a operation!
I'm sure you're not.
I'll be there in three days--four at the most. I've got to get the electricity shut off and square things with your school so the truant officer ain't after you, and--
Movin' in's mighty thirsty work. I usually sit out on my porch of an evening and pour a couple of beers over m'dinner. Come on over and join me, if you want.
You going to bury him in the Pet Sematary?
Does she love the cat?
I'm not climbing that.
You want to rest a bit before you start?
Wouldn't wash?
I'm thinking about going to bed.
And because the dead walked.
The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed. Don't go on, doc. No matter how much you feel you have to. There's more power here than you know.
Louis, the house is beautiful.
Not by me, it isn't. I know how badly I acted, how unfair I was. It's just that I..you know.
Oh Louis, I just don't know about this--
Louis, are you sure?
She.  Goes.  Free.
You've got one shot -- and we can't die.
And Jack.  And the crew.  Free and unharmed.  If you agree ... then ... I will remain with you.
Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
I guess there is a reason to fret.
Would that I could.
I guess you can never truly know someone else's heart.
Miss Swann, if you'll be so kind?
Me!
What?  What was that?  Something funny, Miss Swann? Share, please.
More to drink!
Ah, well ... the company is better than last time.  And the scenery has definitely improved.
Exactly.
Aye, and that's why I know where it's going to be, and that's why I know what Barbossa is up to.  All I need is a crew.
We're catching up!
Ah -- he's learned, then.  Plays things more close to the vest. See, Jack was a cartographer, back in Old England.  Somehow he came by the money to commission the Pearl. Hired himself a crew, promised each man an equal share.  So, they're forty days out, and the First Mate says, everything's an equal share, that should mean the location of the island, too.  So Jack gave up the bearings.  That night, there was a mutiny.
We'll see about that.
Fine by me.  We brought you a nice little boat, so you can all get back to shore, safe and sound.
No ... somone has to make sure this dock stays off-limits to civilians.
I said, no lies.
By remembering that I serve others, not only myself.
I knew you'd listen to reason!
Good.
I worked passage from England as a cabin boy.  After my mother passed, I came out here ... looking for my father.
Don't talk.  These caves magnify sound.  Just follow me.
The worst.  On the other hand, maybe I'm a man who can't pass up a chance for revenge against the black-hearted bastard who stole my ship and left me to die in the middle of the ocean -- twice! -- and who knows how to get what he wants.  Now that's a great pirate.
No, it's not.
You've seen the Black Pearl?
Where did he come from?
Bleak.  Very bleak.
A moment.
Do?  Well, I suppose that depends on you.
In the meantime, we're going to need someone to deal with that mess in the lab.  I don't think we should call Dr. Bright.
Icarus, please!  This is important!
The trunk.
Look, asshole, I don't got time for this.  If you got a problem, you better take care of it yourself.
Oh no, no, no.  No can do.  You enjoyed a tasty beverage and thus this receptacle becomes your responsibility and I don't care if it's a Styrofoam cup or the Exxon Valdez!  You've got to learn to take responsibility!
Yeah.  I knew him when I was still in school.
Of course he is, but at least there isn't a security guard outside my door.
Yes.  That's it.  He's got it.  Oh God, he's got it!
Oh yeah.  See, Susie, a man doesn't do the hard time and just pick up where he left off.  Oh no.  The big house does things to a man.
I've read they're using it to repair cancer cells.
Sure.  Can I ask you one more thing? You haven't published anything in a while.  How come?
Yeah, we'll see.
Am I?  Look!  Right there!  That's exactly what I am talking about.
I'm a plastic man!  A plastic man!
If you don't want to do it this way, I can remove it surgically.
The waste.
With enough exposure, the same thing they do to everything else.
I'm sorry, Daniel, but you have to admit it's pretty ironic that you of all people would be the first man ever polymerized.  It's got to mean something.
Victim my ass!  You stole my security key and used it to break into my lab to do who knows what kind of damage!  Maybe this is the end of the story and you finally got what you deserved!
It's a crime fighting costume, what do you think?  It's underwear, so if you lose your clothes you'll still be decent.
It's too late.  Argon injected it.
You mean he's polymerized, like me?
Do the words 'hero fantasies' mean anything to you?  How about 'infantile dementia'?
Oh yes you are!
Mr. Sim?  Do you have him?  He's alive?
Goodbye, Miss Gallagher.
Well, maybe it's a bit heavy for you. Perhaps if you'd like something lighter - something with a touch of romanceâ€
For what?
Say, you could do anything with me you wanted to. Putty - just putty, that's me.  Now getting back to those eyes of yours - would you mind if I kind of got closer so I could see them?
That's because you're too far away, Stew.
What do you think my friends would say if they found me in a little cheap flat?
You wear them of course, silly.
Yes - isn't it?
Think of the fun we can have - we'll sneak down the back stairs and get in the valet's Ford. How's that?
That's exactly what you mean. Heaven knows you've made that clear to me often enough. Well, I'm sick and tired of it. I've given you party after party - I've taken you to some of the best houses in this town - and introduced you to people of importance - and are you grateful? No! You insult them and act like a bore. I'm sick and tired of having to make excuses for you and the things that you've done. Perhaps it's just as well you're not coming tonight. Maybe I can enjoy myself for once without having to worry about you, and what you're going to do.
Good morning. What does this mean?
You can't walk out of here like this.
All right, all right, don't mention it.
Yeah. The boss sent me over to offer you a job. He wants you to write a daily column on the Tribune.
I'll bite. What's the catch?
Gloria Golden?
Baloney!  Joe! Bring me a special!
Now get this, Conroy. My name is Smith. Always was Smith - and always gonna be Smith.
That's so.
A what?
Araby, my eyeâ€!
No?
Dawson, sir.
There you are. You caught on. You see, you're nice and you're smart too. You caught on right away. Outside! Go on! Outside! And don't come back!
Yes, sir. Very good, sir.
Why, a list of the guests. That's the usual thing, isn't it?
I bet.
You newspaper people have a lot of fun with him, don't you? What is it you call him - the Cinderella Man?
Sure. I wish you all the luck in the world, pal.
I'm pinch-hitting for our society editor tonight. I wanted to see some life in the raw.
My mistake - she's glaring.
Yes.
How about my breakfast? How do you expect me to ring a curtain down on an empty stomach?
It'll be ready in a minute.
The little O'Brien girl, of course - the one you suggested in the story.
No breach-of-promise case has been filed. The matter has been settled out of court.
We admit nothing. However, I have a little statement all prepared.
Go?! Wait a minute - that's a great story! Newspaper reporter was forcibly ejected from Schuyler Mansion, andâ€
Why deny it? The more you deny, the more they print. Let them alone! The thing to do is to sit still and keep our traps shut.
Certainly! I'll take care of this guy Bingy myself, personally.  Now what are you crying about?
I don't eat waffles.
You don't seem to understand. Anne doesn't expect anything from you.
That's putting it crudely, butâ€
I sort of invited him along to bend an elbow. You don't mind, do you?
It's all right. Bring him in.
Pardon me, madam - but what am I to say to the newspapermen?
Oh, my marriage to Anne. Now Mrs. Schuyler, we don't want you to go to any trouble about that. We just want the usual blessings, that's all.
Anne Schuyler, are you going to sit there and watch this man insult us? Haven't you any decency left?
The name is Smythe.
Now the lady said you may goâ€
Smythe, come here. I want to talk to you.  Come on, Smythe, talk to me. Smythe, I'm going nuts. I'm going nuts in this house! This big . . . come on, I'm not going to hurt you. Come on, what's the matter with you?
Found no skeletons?
Oh no, sir. Some people are natural putterers. Others can never master it.
Oh my. You mean, some people are born and never will become putterers?
Oh my, wouldn't that be tragic? To know that you could never be a putterer.
Yes.
Oh nonsense young lady. You're going to start your day with a nice big breakfast.
Sure.
Ah.
Looks just like it did.
Thanks ... I love you.
I think it looks nice.
Bud?
She's crying.
But you can't go out there.
Yeah.  Or like sprinklers in the summer ...
I got caught in the storm. You were gone all night too.
It's fine. You'll put on some make up and ...
Really Biff? The keenest?
Hunh?  Oh, right ...
Oh, Biff. You can "pin" me any time you want to.
Gee whizz, Bud. Guess I'll just have the usual. Cheeseburger and a cherry coke.
I'm fine--but thank you.
Real rain?
Yes I do.
I thought I was allowed to defend myself.
What do you mean!?
No, not that hedge. The other one.
I'm not sure.
I don't know ... It's not possible ...  Is it possible?
Why can't we just EXPLAIN IT?
Biff Martin. Captain of the basketball team.
What?
What were you doing in a library?
I'll get us out of here. I really will. But if we don't play along we could alter their whole existence. We may never get home.
So what's the big deal. Oh. Okay. They're like not good at basketball anymore. Like--omigod, what a tragedy.
Um--hello? You want to like take a look?
The pages filled in?
But like only up to the part about the raft, because I didn't read any farther.
Nothing?
I told you. I'm like positive.
I've done the slut thing, David. It's really kinda old.
... Lover's Lane?
Well it's louder ... And scarier I guess ... And ... and a lot more dangerous ...
Sounds fantastic. You know some kids came up here the other night to go swimming--took off all their clothes.
What's that like?
We'll get you fixed up in no time.
Right. And how did she dress him?
McGinty's.
COME BACK!!!
Oh ... I do. Yeah. It's just that I told my "dad" I'd clean out the rain gutters and Mr. Johnson wanted me to ... to change the tape in the register ...
No you're not.
I'm sorry ... I can't let you do that.
You're not going anywhere. You're gonna get that remote and you're gonna come home and we're gonna make everybody HAPPY AGAIN!!!
I am actually ... Glad to see you've finally shown your true colors.
Much less than that.  An hour and a half.
Well--I always wipe down the counter and then you set out the napkins and glasses and then I make the french fries ...
I'm so glad you're here.
Oh--what's the point, Bud?
Why?
... What's that?
TV repair?
You know--this is a pretty strange way of showing your appreciation.
Yeah. 
So you can't talk to me?
Ok, bye-bye.
No, no, no.
Yeah, but please don't do that.
....wait a minute: why is this about you now? Why is it always about you?
Yeah, no, it's not, it's just --
-- but since you're not going I guess none of this matters and I'll bring her anyway.
Well I'm glad you didn't, thank you.
Seriously, though: We're going to eat, I said.
I feel really on the spot now.
What?
What? Tell me why you wanna know --
-- all I want is the number of where she's staying and that should be god damn good enough, now stop treating me this way, please -- Just Give Me The Number Elizabeth Please Now I think I will kill you if you don't.
Nothing, huh, do you know what I'm doing?
I'm just laying on my bed.
Are you watching a porno movie?
Well. I have no way of knowing. So it doesn't matter.
Can I ask you a question?
Me?
You don't even know how much it is.
I know but I....how much is it?
No. I'm sorry.
....what....?
This is....illegal....I'll call the police.
It was cool last night.
Thank you.
It's fine. It was fun, though.
-- I'm probably not gonna go though.
Alright?
....Hi.....
Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah we get along well.  You didn't get along with her very well?
....I'm sorry....I lost my thoughts, what I was saying....
Yeah.
You see?
I'm sorry. I thought you said --
No I didn't say that.
Did something happen; are you alright?
Did you pick it up from the street?
I just wanted you to know, wherever you're going or whatever you're doing right now I want you to know that I wanted to kiss you just then.
Ok.
Lena?
When was the last time you had a girlfriend?
yeah.
For what?
I don't have any business here. I came here for you, I didn't have any business.
That's right you travel so much.
Can I come home with you when we get there?
I'm sorry.
Ok.
I'm fine, I have your work number.
Sir, a young man saw you coming out of the bathroom.
I'm gonna call the police then, sir.
The police are on their way.
......and this is confidential?
Thank you.
Like a psychiatrist?
It takes time to process --
No, no, no, no, nO, NO, NO!
You're goin' on a trip?
No.........but airline miles are just like a currency these days.
Yeah.
I need to talk to you for a second.
What?
What do you have in the house?
Yes.
Alright, alright.
I know.
I know.
Yes you do. We were calling you Gay Boy and you got so mad....
Will you call me later to talk about asking Walter for the shrink? And we can talk about - he said you have this crying problem or something?
Just tell him to call me.
I'm sorry. You're right.
Not now, or we're both done for.
But why heap such ghastly fantasies atop an already ghastly existence?
I've you to look after me, haven't I?
I must grant him his last rites.
If you won't be true to your word, then you've left me no choice.
You know what sacrilege is, don't you? The last refuge of the failed provocateur.
Orvolle. His wine.  From now on, nothing but water at every meal --
-- and your meat shall be de-boned.
NOW STRIP.
Your wig. Remove your wig.
Your words drove Bouchon to --
-- that was lust --
Surely you'll grant me a final word.
I'll need an office on the grounds; someplace to store my things.
And his writing?
Do you favor its publication?
No. It most certainly was not.
-- a veritable freak show for tourists and curiosity seekers. Charenton is a sanatorium; she is not a circus. The theater is henceforth closed. As for your avowed friend -- playwright emeritus of the madhouse --
Do you know how I define "idealism," Monsieur DelbenÃ¨?
Maybe someday you'll tell me your name.
Was ever a man more risquÃ¨? He wants to take me every way!
Oh, it's terrible! It's too, too terrible!  Well. Go on.
Don't start --
Go ahead; you've a key. Slip it through my tiny hole...
I put myself at life and limb. Surely that's worth a few louis.
Is it awfully violent?
Is it terribly erotic?
Tortures so arcane, so medieval, even I haven't the words to describe them. If you've an ounce of pity in your heart, you'll throw caution aside, and unlock my door...
"What shall I ready?" asked Fanchon. "My mouth, my ass or my succulent oyster?"
Desperation has driven me past etiquette, all the way to frenzy.
That barely covers the cost of his room. There's nary a penny left over for appropriate treatments. Opiates to quell his temper. Restraints to chasten him when he misbehaves.
I'm on the brink of bankruptcy; my husband's resources are all but exhausted. And to what end, I ask you?
I can say, with the utmost sincerity, that every franc you've given me has been put to sterling use.
To flaunt your deviance in public? Upon a stage?
You ought to court the Doctor's favor, not his contempt.
Very much.
I wonder sometimes.
My name is Orson Welles
Do you?
Hope you don't mind my popping in--
Uh-hub.
Bel Air is restricted.
Yeah
There certainly is I There certainly is! Aw, to hell with you!
One . . . buys things.
A million dollars a year on art and st-st-statues and there's nothing to explain?!
You don't have any money left, okay?! That's the truth. I don't wanna say it, nobody else will say it, but it's the truth. You spent it all. You can't buy the Tribune in Chicago -- you can't buy ^ g-g- goddamn thing. Now you better face up to it--
I wanted it
You are slovenly and unattractive and I won't  t-t-t-tolerate it.
I will not have this in my home.
I just want to understand--
Thank you, sir. She begins to leave
Why did we not know about this sooner?
I pay you a good deal of money to be my eyes and ears in Hollywood, do I not? If you cannot provide this simple service you are of no use to me.
"You talk about the people as if you owned them. As though they belonged to you. As long as I can remember, you've talked about--"  Orson, I am so goddamn tired--
Then make them up! You're drunk and you're angry.
"A toast then, Jedediah, to love on my own terms. Those are the only terms anybody ever knows, his own."
That's right
Forget it-
Showing life
Who the hell wants to see life?! People are sick to death of life! They want make-believe, pal. Fantasy. They want Tarzan and Jane, not Tristan and Isolde.
You're a laugh-riot, kid.
Yeah, it's the place God would have built, if he'd had the money.
Oh Christ...
Mank-
Howard Hughes, he would just kill us. Hearst he would kill us and fuck everything we ever loved.
We're doing Hearst.
I expected more from you.
I don't have it anymore?!
They don't have to.
The people. When they pay him homage, he adores them. But when they have the ... audacity to question him. To doubt him. To embarrass him. Then he despises them.
Yeah, but the margins are real wide.
Good?! Good?! Words fail you at last! It's terrific! Now I'll have to do some shaping, of course, and some of the scenes aren't exactly . . . exactly . . .
What?
Cain -- like the Bible guy?
Mank, sit down. You missed the opening of the new picture but I'll go back--
It's too late. The movie's made
Yeah, ain't it swell?
Well, this is a great pleasure. Miss Davies! I just saw that ENCHANTMENT is playing at a the Tivoli, the revival house in Santa Monica. That was a fine picture!
That's for me to decide.
Again
Please don't ask me to do this.
It's the safe bet, Orson. There's nothing wrong with that.
Then find another theater
Why don't you just have the guts to admit it
How dare you talk to me like that! Do you think I'm like all the rest of those pirates?! Like Mayer and Warner? Is that what you think--?!
Spare me the aria, I know what you want--
Orson -- we can't get the fucking camera any fucking lower so find another fucking shot!
Huh? Whadda ya mean, get up?
Now the fight's off the books altogether. Meyer Lansky couldn't get a bet down on this fight. Some people are saying you're going into the tank.
I'm gonna kill him. That fuckin' jig's gonna wish he never came outa the jungle. You got any money?
It looks done. I'll take it the way it is.
You know?
Hit me in the face.
You heard me, I said hit me.
Go ahead. I ain't drunk. Take your best shot. On the jaw.
How do you know? You know her that good?
I don't like all those other clowns around. That's all I know.
I'm the only guy ever to beat Sugar Ray, and I still don't have a shot at the title.
Jake, you're the one who said you could get down to 155! What did I do, pull it out of the fuckin' hat?
This Janiro's an up-and-coming fighter, this kid you gotta knock out. Knockout this fuckin' kid! I'm telling you, this is your step towards getting a shot at the title. Listen to me: I'm telling you. You been killin' yourself for three years. There's nobody left -- they're afraid to fight you. This Janiro's up-and- coming. He don't know. Fuckin' tear him apart, wipe him out! What are you worried about? Your weight? Look, even if you lose they're gonna think you're weak; they're gonna think you're not the fighter you used to be. They'll match you with guys they were afraid to match you with before, and then you'll kill them and you'll get your title shot. And if you beat this kid Janiro, they gotta give you a shot at the title because there's nobody else. Either way you win and you do it on your own -- just like you want it. All right?
I remember the first time I met Vickie... I know there's somethin' up. I know she's doin' somethin', but I can't catch her...
What do you mean?
Sure, I'll keep an eye on her.
Where you been?
You know, when you gave him a beatin'.
Some things changed between us. Now, he thinks who the fuck he is. He's been passing certain remarks that I don't like.
But you said "you."
Eh, Joey, even you don't know what you meant. You mentioned Salvy, Tommy Como, you -- that means somethin'. Why'd you say them? You coulda said anybody.
Did you ever fuck my wife?
I don't mean now. I mean before -- before we met.
You're very smart, Joey, very smart. Nobody gives me a straight answer around here. You're givin' me these answers, but you still didn't answer my question. Did you fuck Vickie?
I gotta go. I gotta get outta here. I can't take this shit. Lenore is waitin' for me. I gotta go. You're a definite wacko. You're fuckin' crazy, you know that, crazy.
Maybe it wasn't you, but you know what I'm talkin' about.
Come over here.
No, I'm not.
In other words, you're not interested in him but you'd be interested in somebody else, right?
Then why'd you say that thing about Tony Janiro?
What did I say?
What was it about?
I am answering...
I don't know.
Aw, c'mon. Don't say that.
Jake, sit down for a minute.
I'd tell you to bet a bundle.
Well, go ahead, tell Jake. He's gonna kill me anyway. It's a matter of time.
Jefferies?
But his leg!
Do that.
What time?
The Thorwalds -- at six in the morning?
That depends on who "they" were.
I told you that --
I know what you told me! She went in to get evidence, and she came out with it.
A possibility.
A fact! Last night he killed a dog for pawing in his garden. Why? Because he had something buried in there. Something a dog could scent.
You think perhaps it was "old hambone?"
Indo-China. Got a code tip from the bureau chief this morning. The place is about to go up in smoke.
Okay. When do I leave? Half-hour? An hour?
I'll -- I'll get married. Then I'll never be able to go anywhere.
For a little business meeting -- to settle the estate of your late wife.
It's happened before, you know! Some of the world's happiest marriage have started 'under the gun' you might say.
Is what you want something you can discuss?
Speaking of misery, Miss Lonely Hearts drank herself to sleep again. Alone.
Poor girl. Someday she'll find her happiness.
Huh?
You called the police?
I'll watch the alleyway -- in case it goes that way.
There's something buried there.
I have a feeling we've just begun.
You can tell that from here?
Not yet, Jeff.
You haven't even heard from him?
Not a word.
And your stomach?
Going on right here. It's a big night.
For what?
How can you tell that -- from here?
You said it resembled my apartment, didn't you?
Your mind is. And when I want a man, I want all of him.
Not that salesman's wife. And why didn't he go to work today?
Something too frightful to utter.
You'd better before you catch the disease!
There's nothing to see.
Maybe he's leaving his wife. I don't know, and I don't care. Lots of people have saws, knives and ropes around their houses. Lots of men don't speak to their wives all day. Lots of wives nag, and men hate them, and trouble starts -- but very, very, very few of them end up in murder -- if that's what you're thinking.
Someone not his wife?
Do they hide it in their husband's clothes?
Basic equipment. You don't leave it behind in your husband's drawer in your favorite handbag.
Well, I have a pat rebuttal for Mr. Doyle -- that couldn't be Mrs. Thorwald -- or I don't know women.
I do?
You mean -- like the kitchen? And make us some coffee?
Of course, they have the same chance. They can look at me like a bug under glass, if they want to.
No, Lisa -- I don't think he did.
Is he cleaning house?
Now hold on. I'm not a bit squeamish about what might be under those flowers -- but I don't care to watch two women end up like that dog --
Jim Stark.
We got to do something.  Don't we?
How'd he get in?
Crunch--my father's--You going to kill him?
Then shut your mouth before your guts run out!
And listen--watch out about the pals you choose--Know what I mean? Don't let them choose you--
Suppose you knew that you had to do something very dangerous--where you have to prove something you need to know--a question of honor.  Would you do it?
I wouldn't do anything hasty. Let's get a little light on the subject.
We'll make time.  Where's some paper.  We'll make a list and if we're still stuck then we ought to get some advice--
You know I never stop you from anything.  Believe me--you're at a wonderful age.  In ten years you'll look back on this and wish you were a kid again.
Will you wait a minute?
You don't?
Go on--Give 'em to your friends.
No, honey.  No, he's not here.
Do you hear from him, son?
I don't know.  End up in the electric chair?
Hi there.
He has a knife.
Judy.
I'm here.  Shut up.
Shut up.  Are you nuts?
What?
Hey!  How 'bout that!
I had to go to a head-shrinker.  I only went twice though.  My mother said it cost too much, so she went to Hawaii instead.
Boy, I'm blind as a bat!  You got a match?  I'm going to break my neck in here.  Where are you?
I know.  Light a match, will you?
Keep away from me!  I don't believe you anymore!
Do you enjoy doing this to me or what--
And you wanted him to make a list!
I can't keep it to myself anymore--
Just tell a little white lie?
Grandma?
Leave me alone.
No.
I just get so--  Boy, sometimes the temperature goes way up. RAY  Okay.  Okay.  Let it out.
Mess that kid up?
Pretty mixed up?
Listen--
A what?
I'm sorry I treated you mean today. You shouldn't believe what I say when I'm with the kids.  Nobody acts sincere.
I don't know, but we can't stay here.
Listen!  I know a place!  PLATO showed me before.  An old deserted mansion near the planetarium  Would you go with me?
You see, we've just--oh, you tell him, darling.  I'm so embarrassed I could die!
There's just one thing.  What about--
See, we're very modern.
How many rooms do you think there are?
What a relief!
What?
I never felt so clean before.
Oh, I don't know.  You have to get to know him.  He doesn't say much but when he does you know he means it.  He's sincere.
Want to finish my hamburger?  I only took a bite.
Hi.
He calls me a dirty tramp--my own father!
That one?
Do you think you can get back at your Dad that way?  I mean sometimes if we can't get as close to somebody as we'd like we have to try making them jealous--so they'll have to pay attention.  Did you ever think of that?
I'll never get close to anybody.
But the same song.  I think it's fantastic!
Daddy--
Must have a way with stationery.
NO!
To all those cons...
I've been doing good, though.
Radio said.
No, no, no. Be like you want to be.
Yes it was all you --
Blackjack, Nick, blackjack I am good at. I mean, they'd give us some free games or something, wouldn't they? Since you worked there?
We'll have more fun in Detroit.
What's going ON!!!
You sold him out.
Nick --
JESUS CHRIST!
All I wanted... was to make it home... for a little of Dad's turkey, and Mom's stuffing... Aunt Lisbeth's acorn gravy... Aunt Mary's cranberry buns...
I'm almost done.
We need a gun, Ash. We need a gun...
Yeah. That's love.
I'm glad it was me.
No --
You what...
Yes!
Wrote you a hundred letters, didn't she? Where's she work?
Where'd she drop her cherry?
What the fuck are you talking about.
More than you know.
You do.
Nick, here's what we're gonna do. In the spirit of the season, I'm going to give you a chance. I understand you're unhappy. Right outta the lockup, here against your will, it's the holidays and there's reruns on TV.  So we're gonna have a contest.
...ttt..tt... two out of three?
What's the code?
I'm no threat without a gun.
Hey! HEY! THERE IS A POWWOW SAFE!
What... Powwow...
The Powwow Safe where you steal your money! Where you cheat your Indians!
The tribe is concerned that many of your... new ideas are not resulting in any new venues.
I got a bacon for him and a bacon for me; there's four cheeseburgers and two roast beefs --
My what?!
Buffet is by the goddamn bar! What the hell kind of map is this?!
We walk outta here, we hit that road, what's the first thing you're gonna do.
Not yet.
Fuckin' Christmas, man. Fuckin, Christmas on the outs.
Get a hot mug of chocolate.  First thing I'm gonna do.
Yeah.
Yeah. Fuckin' Christmas.
Fuck your hot chocolate, Rudy.
Five years, Nicky. Five years.  I just want to go home.
Tell her... I'll be there ...
Why not have her pretend to find me? Pretend to write me and reel me in? Tell her new trucker-man she'd pose as some sister of his named Ashley?
And you set me up.
How'd you know I'd do it.
You're taking my money. Switch seats with me. Switch seats with me if you're not taking my money --
Now where were we?
Thanks, don't mind if I do.
Yes.
I'm sorry man, I shoulda picked you up personally at the pen. This whole week's just been crazy. I've had my head up my ass the entire time.
Funny you should mention it. That's what your father and I been talkin' about.
Eddie, if I was a pirate, I wouldn't throw you to the crew.
Scagnetti? Oh shit, I hear he's a motherfucker.
A snake charmer, what the fuck d'you think. I'll call a doctor, take care of him, fix 'm right up. No, where's Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue?
Elois?
Me and you'll drive down to Long Beach tomorrow. I'll introduce you to Matthews, tell him what's going on.
What? Nobody set anybody up.
Hey, fuck you man, you weren't there, we were. And I'm tellin' ya, the cops had that store staked out.
What the fuck d'you think we've been askin' each other?
Would you stop it with that shit! You beat on this prick enough, he'll tell ya he started the Chicago fire. That don't necessarily make it so. Okay, first things fucking last, where's the shit? Please tell me somebody brought something with them.
I was in the sixth grade when that show was on. I totally dug it. What the fuck was the name of the chick who played Christie Love?
Pam Grier.
No, it wasn't Pam Grier, Pam Grier was the other one. Pam Grier made the movies. Christie Love was like a Pam Grier TV show, without Pam Grier.
What the fuck was that chick's name? Oh this is just great, I'm totally fuckin' tortured now.
This better not be some Freddy joke.
The way they talk to each other. You can tell they're buddies.
Yeah.
A guy named Scagnetti. Seymour Scagnetti.
Oh fuck, Toby's that little china girl.
Fuck you, wrong. I'm right! What the fuck do you know about it anyway? You're still listening to Jerry- fucking-Vale.
Why am I Mr. Pink?
Cause you're a faggot, alright?
Blonde, shoot this piece of shit, will ya?
That piece of shit. Workin' with the cops.
Mr. Pink.
Marvin, I need you to hold on. There's officers positioned and waiting to move in a block away.
What're you talkin' about?
That fuckin' shooting spree in the store.
You almost killed me, asshole! If I had any idea what type of guy you were, I never would've agreed to work with you.
I said: "Are you gonna bark all day, dog, or are you gonna bite."
No, I'm not!
Correct.
Joe.
Blonde went crazy. He slashed the cop's face, cut off his ear and was gonna burn him alive.
Oh that's just fucking great! Where's Brown?
Splash some water on your face. Take a breather.
What's wrong with it?
Could you believe Mr. Blonde?
That was one of the most insane fucking things I've ever seen. Why the fuck would Joe hire somebody like that?
Did ya see what happened to anybody else?
At that point it became every man for himself. As far as Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue are concerned, I ain't got the foggiest. Once I got out, I never looked back.
How can you be so sure?
Where?
That was the plan, we meet here.
Two jobs back, it was a four man job, we discovered one of the team was an undercover cop.
So who's the rat this time? Mr. Blue? Mr. Blonde? Joe? It's Joe's show, he set this whole thing up. Maybe he set it up to set it up.
I told him my first name, and where I'm from.
I told him where I was from a few days ago. It was just a casual conversation.
And what was tellin him your name when you weren't supposed to?
That fuckin did it!
Fuck you, White! I didn't create this situation, I'm just dealin' with it. You're acting like a first- year fuckin' thief. I'm actin like a professional. They get him, they can get you, they get you, they get closer to me, and that can't happen. And you, you motherfucker, are looking at me like it's my fault. I didn't tell him my name. I didn't tell him where I was from. I didn't tell him what I knew better than to tell him. Fuck, fifteen minutes ago, you almost told me your name. You, buddy, are stuck in a situation you created. So if you wanna throw bad looks somewhere, throw 'em at a mirror.
We don't think this place is safe.
There's a slight difference.
Oh that's really easy for you to say, you're Mr. White. You gotta cool-sounding name. So tell me, Mr. White, if you think "Mr. Pink" is no big deal, you wanna trade?
We're going to look for him. Want to come along?
All I can get out of her is she don't care about livin'.
Maybe you won't feel that way after I tell you what I stopped in for.
As far as -- Sonora?
You can't leave us here.
Course I can't. I'll give you a lift to the first ranch.
Are the horses stragglin' or aren't they?
We can't stay here!
And it's not only because the trip's a tough one --
Will she be dark or fair?
Maybe they will.
And meet him there.
Swimming.
Good thing you didn't.
That ain't why. I just figure it's about time to start runnin' my own life.
You think you're so slmighty -- smart -- Who are you to sit up there and say nobody's good enough for you, like you said yesterday -- just because a man kisses a woman --
I said I didn't care.
I'm sorry. Let's go.
Not if I know Mary. When she rides into Sonora, you'll be with her. And mighty glad to be there after this. I don't see how you stood it as long as you did.
No. But it's mine and I didn't want anyone foolin' with it.
Well cheer, why don't you? No more responsibilities, Mary. Marcia -- Elaine -- me -- all taken care of. Down there feeding horses and raising kids, you won't have a thing to worry about.
Go ahead.
They went on like I told you.
How many ways can a man say no.
What's the use.
Maybe you are. I'm not.
Okay. A-B-C -- D-E-F -- G-H-I --
That's the end of the line.
There's plenty of use for reading -- you'll see.
What do they look like?
You were supposed to be reading words.
Oh, sure.
I found a picture of his wife.
No, he lost the house after the stock market crash.
No. I never date outside my race.
Her hair doesn't have as many split ends at yours. Her skin isn't as oily as yours, either. Also, sometimes your eyes get kinda squinty and they look like you might have Down's Syndrome or something. Otherwise the resemblance is uncanny.
Let's get outta here.
Wait, I want to check something. Give me a hand.
That we should take our friendship a little further?
No. Keep rubbing.
No, Buddy, I'm the one he wants.
Actually, I was going to say let me have your computer if you die.
Yeah, I know, I just love having a guy for a friend.
Look, what I'm trying to say --
Oh.
You know, walking on the beach, holding hands, kissing, making love...
Oh, Buddy, that's so romantic.
That means more screen time for us.
Yes, it was me all along. I killed Hugh Kane and his mistress.
You could use the grade, huh?
I told you it would taste just like chicken.
They're on top of the bookshelf. I'll get them.
Good thinking, Dwight. Traumatized co-eds are a sure thing.
Let's not forget, folks, this is a study on sleep disorders.
Are you sure it's not the tape?
I think we should consider cutting the experiment short.
Yes, but I've seen the tapes. This poltergeist is becoming increasingly more violent. We all could be in danger. I say we pull the plug.
Oh, I couldn't do that.
Okay, give me my belt.
Alright, go to the belt store...
She's gotten worse, Father. She won't eat, she won't talk. The child won't even let me touch her.
Yes... Sometimes you have to give them candy.
Because she will lie?
No, I'm fine.
Washington is full of cornpone country pussy -- just ask Jesse Jackson.
What does it say?
You said you hated him.
MURDERED?!!
Yes murdered! You said you hated your teacher yesterday and he was murdered too. I don't know... maybe Mom's nuts!
Always the dentist.
But, Chip...
You're hot tonight, honey... but be quiet! Shhhh! The kids!
It's Ok, Eugene. I understand... I'll go fix breakfast. 
Not at first, but then I heard the same inflection in a voice at a social gathering and I put two and two together.
Let me check the zip - 212 Fuck you?
Yes, I am... I'm sorry Mrs. Wilson... It's driving me crazy... I've changed my number twice already... Please help me!
Sorry, Mom. Thanks.  Hey, Chip, think I could get 50c for Vanilla Ice.
Are we leaving?
That's a Franklin Mint piece. Eight dollars.
Yes. She bought my sister's business.
Why would Mrs. Redi lie to me?
That's what I tried to find out.	I went to La Jeunesse â€”â  -- used a phony health inspector's badge â€”â they let me go through the works -- all but one room. That room was locked. I'd like to see the inside of that room.
No.
You won't get any water and you won't get any rest. You may as well drink.
How's Miss Jacqueline?
You mean Miss Jacqueline's gone, and you don't know where she is?
Well, don't worry. I saw Miss Jacqueline only a week ago. I saw her at a little restaurant the boy friend took me to -- an Italian place down in the Village â€-	"The Dante."
It's on Peary Street. Just ask the people who run it. They'll remember her.  People who see Miss Jacqueline never forget her.
But I reel guilty. It doesn't seem right for me to enjoy myself with Jacqueline gone.
Yes.
Greg, it isn't a wild tale. It's true. If there were only some way --
Don't be ridiculous. For months I've had the best private detective in New York looking for Miss Gibson.
You don't even know Jacqueline Gibson.
Well, that's illuminating.
I don't know.
And you don't want to die. I've always wanted to die -- always.
Why wait?
But you're happy here -- you like your work â€-
It's because of Jacqueline â€”â I can't go on looking for her --
They may have been friends of hers.
Oh, the wine. I have forgotten the wine.
I've lost my knack.
After that wonderful first book â€- after all the adulation and the good reviews?
I hope it finds as much favor as your other book -- but somehow I doubt it -- the time is out of tune.
Tell me where Jacqueline is -â€ we've got to find her.
No other reason â€”â no woman â€”â”not the little Miss Gibson?
I'll do all I can to help. I'll go to my publisher tomorrow.
Yes, Miss Gibson. I've come to take you to your sister.
You know where she is?
Unless what?
You're even sentimental about it. What made you change your mind?
I'll be out in a minute.
Why?
She's not been here for a long time.
Yes -- and pays the rent every month.
Of course.
Yes?
Because I have something very important to do.
I'll be right back with Mrs. Wheeler.
When?
I know. You introduced Jacqueline to us -- but how could you tell â€-
I should have known. She had no sincerity â€- no real belief.
Yes.  Oh, you mean to bring in! No. Yes, I have some other things, no, I don't need to bring them in. This is all I need to stay here.
No, I think you look... fine.
Oh. Well, I did. I was in a band once, and the music was always secondary to just flat out offending as many people as possible.
Did you know that if you shut someone up in a room, and the only clock he has reference to runs two hours slow for every twenty-four, that his body will eventually adjust to that schedule? Simply because the mind honestly perceives that twenty-six hours are twenty-four, the body follows. And then there are sections of time. Your life can be broken down into the sections of time that formed your personality . For instance, when I was twelve, I had an eleven minute conversation with my father that to this day defines our relationship. Now, I'm not saying that everything happened in that specific section of time, but the events of my childhood involving my father led up to, and then were crystallized in, that eleven minutes.
Anyway, I think the mind is very flexible as far as time is concerned.
I knew him very well. We were extremely close until I dropped out.
Oh, lots of reasons, most of them boring. But, up until I dropped out, John and I were... very much alike.
That's hard to believe. The two of you seem so different.
I would imagine that we are, now. I think I'm ready to use the bathroom, finally.
Hmm. Well, maybe you are. Really, I wouldn't pay much attention.
It's up to you. But I warn you, if you tell me something personal, I might do the same.
I am self-conscious, but not in the same way that you are. You have got to be the most attractive self- conscious person I've ever seen.
Well, my therapist knows me intimately.
What kind of personal project?
Donna was a girl I knew in Florida.
You just ask them questions?
Why not?
Don't you want to make one?
That's a good question.
What do you have to do to get ready?
Sometimes. Afterward.
Absolutely not.
Why?
About who?
I remember. You could do that, couldn't you? Go down on me?
That's correct.
Kind of. I mean, John's like this kind of... craftsman. Like he's a carpenter, and he makes really good tables. But that's all he can make, and I don't need anymore tables.
No.
I don't know.
As I said, I haven't decided what to do, exactly. Perhaps I won't do anything.
I'm just going to keep asking until you answer. I'm sure there's plenty of tape.
I called you Tuesday at 3:30 and they said you weren't in. Do you remember where you were?
There's nothing to know, Ann.
For God's sake, Ann, I am not fucking your sister. I don't find her that attractive, for one.
Yes!
Nothing. I mean, nothing. I try not to do anything that will produce garbage, so obviously we're talking about eating and basic stuff like that. Did you know that the average person produces three pounds of garbage a day?
Oh, yeah.  But see, I've never really been into sex that much, I mean, I like it and everything, it just does't freak me out, I wouldn't miss it, you know? But anyway, lately we haven't been doing anything at all. Like I said, it's not that I miss it, but I'm curious the way things kind of slacked off all of a sudden.
I take it you've never masturbated?
Did you find him attractive?
I'm glad you feel that way, because I feel that way, too.
But you don't have hidden motives for feeling that way, right?
Why?
What?
Well, he doesn't strike me as the kind of person that would go in for that sort of thing, anyway.
Ann, you always underestimate me.
Ann, you don't have a clue. Look, I don't even know why we're discussing this, I'll just call him myself.
I don't feel right just giving you the address so that you can go over there and...
I don't know, I'll get her a card or something.
Okay, Ann, okay. How about this: you buy her something nice, and I'll pay for half. All right?
Then what's the story, what's this "strange" bullshit all of a sudden? Is he drowning puppies, or what?
Then why'd you call me?
What!?
It looks like a tablecloth.
I'm Cynthia Bishop.
You want me to leave?
She still is.
She didn't give you my address?
Do I sit or stand?
Describe for me your first sexual experience.
I was... eight years old. Michael Green, who was also eight, asked if he could watch me take a pee. I said he could if I could watch him take one, too. He said okay, and then we went into the woods behind our house. I got this feeling he was chickening out because he kept saying, "Ladies first!" So I pulled down my underpants and urinated, and he ran away before I even finished.
Do you like the way I look?
Different.
I'm sure a substantial number of men in this town would volunteer.
How about if you record over the one we already made? You could have the same date and not use another tape. Who would know?
I can handle it. Besides, the money is good and some of the guys are cute. And you are in no position to be jealous.
Who said I was jealous?
Sure. Maybe he's the man I'm looking for. Then I won't have to fuck worried husbands all the time.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
Right now.
Jesus. I could almost understand it if he was screwing these people, almost. Why doesn't he just buy some magazines or porno movies or something?
Why not?
It just wasn't a smart thing to do. Did you sign any sort of paper, or did he have any contract with you saying he wouldn't broadcast these tapes?
Exactly what I said. I'd trust him before I'd trust you. How much clearer can I be?
Oh, please. Come on, John. You're fucking your wife's sister and you hardly been married a year. You're a liar. But at least I know you're a liar. It's the people that don't know, like Ann, that have to watch out.
No, he didn't put me up to this. Jesus, I don't need people to tell me what I should do. I've just been thinking about things, that's all.
Or go someplace in a hurry.
What the hell do you think? I love Ann. You think I'm going to tell her about Cynthia and hurt her feelings like that?
Shut up!!!
Mr. Kirkland has asked me to inform you that he has obtained legal representation elsewhere, and that if you have a message for him to leave it with me.
Yeah.
He hates doctors. Doctors and lawyers. He never goes to doctors.
Sure.
I knew the man, Emil Hobbes, a doctor and a professor at university. I saw the girl around the building but I didn't know her. She never came to the clinic.
Yeah. This is an island, you know? Takes too long to get into the city. We gotta have everything right here or somebody complains.
Mm? OK. Be with you in a sec.
Uh, OK. Sure.
Well? Supper at my place?
Nope. Damned thing wriggled out of my hands. That's all.
Well, at least you still talk the same.
You know and I know that Hobbes was a lousy teacher, eh? Lousy. Dry, academic, afraid of women, lousy. But he was always a genius at one thing -- getting grants. Could he get grants for crazy projects?
Rollo, you know me. Once a GP, always a GP.
Who was she?
Yes?
No? How come?
I'd kinda like to come over there and have a look at one of these guys.
OK, Rog. See you at ten.
NIGHT NIGHT
BREAKING OUT
Time to check with Flavors.
Congratulations!  It's 'Happy Homes' for Harry and Emily Weiss of Denton.
I got it!  I got it!!!
It's no use pussyfooting around, Janet -- we have to cut quick and deep.
They probably meant Irving and wanted you to swing.
SOLD??!!
Show yourself.  The real you. The secret you.
Well, Betty, there are many ways that the spider may catch the fly...
He was a President.
We've got to, Brad, everyone's watching.
TENDERNESS AND INNOCENCE IN DENTON`
Sure thing.
The question is, does Brad want to see you?  Quite frankly, he hates you.
What do you mean?
He's a lame dog, remember?  But even he wouldn't want to see you like this.
Just what the Doctor ordered.  I know.  Come on in, my favourite show's just started.
I NEED SOME
No...couldn't I do this later?
Me?
You've got a really tight team around you.  And everybody needs you!
Arrest that man!  He's committed to our care.
What does he know about it?
We're not confused.
We love you, Baby.
The problem with that is that then there's one extra --
I don't know, Christine. Perhaps it's because I feel attacked.
I'm sorry, Miles. We did all we could. You've been a real trooper.  Tell him I'll call back.
So I guess that's it.
You know me. I love it up here. How about you?
Oh, stop it. Make yourselves comfortable.  You boys hungry?
You should get back together with Victoria. She was good for you.
In Santa Ynez.  And I agree with you about Cab Franc.
No, we're paying for the wine.
It's a long shot, all right? And Conundrum is just a small specialty press anyway. I'm not getting my hopes up. I've stopped caring. That's it. I've stopped caring.
Yes. Absolutely. Despite your crass behavior, I'm really glad we're finally getting this time together.
You know how long I've been begging to take you on the wine tour. I was beginning to think it was never going to happen.
100% Pinot Noir. Single vineyard. They don't even make it anymore.
Color in the red wines comes from the skins. This juice is free run, so there's no skin contact in the fermentation, ergo no color.
It's her birthday tomorrow. And I don't feel right driving by her house and not stopping in, okay? It'll just take a second. She's right off the freeway.
Speak for yourself. I get chicks looking at me all the time. All ages.
Now we're talking.
Want some?
You think I'm making a mistake marrying Christine?
Whoa.
Pour us a couple.
And she likes Pinot.
Jack, she's a fucking waitress in Buellton. How would that ever work?
She has the best palate of any woman I've ever known. She could even differentiate Italian wines.
Because I knew you'd freak out and probably get so depressed you wouldn't even come on this trip. But then I figured here would be the best place to tell you. We're here to forget about all that shit. We're here to party!
I'm a quick learner.
Cute? She's a fucking hottie. And you almost tell her I'm getting married. What's the matter with you?  Gotta love it. Gotta love it.
Aye-aye, captain.
If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving. I am not drinking any fucking Merlot!
Shut up. Shut your face.
You go. In fact, use my clubs. They're brand new -- gift from Christine's dad.  It's on me. Oh, say, by the way, Stephanie and me were thinking we'd all go to the Hitching Post tonight and sit at one of Maya's tables, and she'll bring us some great wines and then we can all --
She's been leaving messages here too.
Right now.
Yep.
Well, I've been doing some thinking.
Hey, asshole! That's not cool!
Is what the money thing?
No.
I don't know. Tastes okay to me.  Hey, they got a reserve pinot.
What's up?
What?
What?
No way. No way.
Yeah, yeah. Like that. Just like that.
Quite a week.
Whatever. Sorry.
Back at you.
Sure.
Good for you.
You've got a '61 Cheval Blanc that's just sitting there? Go get it.  Right now. Hurry up...
Wow. Anyway, I think it's amazing you're getting it published. Really. I know how hard it is. Just to write it even.
Yeah. Thanks.
Can I ask you a personal question?
What about me?
Oh, yeah. No. I mean yeah, I stopped by for a drink. Didn't see you.
You too.
And I haven't been with anyone since my divorce. This has been a big deal for me, Maya -- hanging out with you, and last night. I really like you, Maya. And I'm not Jack. I'm just his... his freshman roommate from San Diego State.
Heard you got remarried! Congratulations. Didn't think you had the stomach for another go-round.
You see, Vicki, I just heard about this today, you getting married that is, and I was kind of taken aback. Kind of hard to believe.
Oh, Miles. That's awful. What are you going to do?
Back to the drawing board, I guess. Or not. So... you're married. Congratulations. You look happy.
I am.
Seems like everyone's getting married. A year ago it was all divorces. Now it's all weddings. Cyclical, I guess.
This is a tasting, sir. Not a bar.
Yeah, I reserved the tee time about a month ago.
Huh. Jack loves golf. Crazy about it.
Bye, Stephanie. Bye, Siena, Caryl.
I just got divorced. Phyllis.
I saw a monster. Can I have a glass of water?
She doesn't answer me either.
This one?
No dad!
Don't touch him.
You don't even know what that word means.
Good.
...I will.
What?  Colleen?... Colleen?
Clear for what?
Explain noises.
I heard.
Yes, it was.
The bird could have had a heart attack and crushed his head when he fell.
We have to go in the basement.
Got it!
It came on about two hours ago. Woke me up.  We won Graham.
What's two?
The family room.
Yeah baby. I think someone did.
Okay.  So he was tall?
He wasn't drinking. Ray fell asleep at the wheel.
Why not?
What did you say?
What do you mean, the horses?
Yeah, I kissed a girl and this guy didn't like it and we had some words, so I decided to get out of there.
Your next water ain't for three days.
Wait a minute. Get down off of there, Augie.
Yeah... maybe. So long.
McKendrick's men got him.
How's Mr. Parker doing?
That I do.
I've never been in there. They just jumped you out of the blue?
South of here, past Chimayo.
I understand.
No hard feelings.
Why, J.T., watch what you're saying around Augie. Emmett didn't kill anybody.
He'll be here.
Let's get out of here.
Don't press your luck, Carter.
We'll see about that. I'm Sheriff John Langston. As you may have guessed, I am not from these parts.
Daddy's dead.
I don't have any family any more.
I heard from Stella you were trying to find Jake. What happened to Emmett?
You don't know?
He's good, all right. Too good for my men. That's why you've got to take care of it.
So have I. I've got a legitimate job now. I can use a guy like you.
Well, thanks, but forget it.
I thought we talked about that.
We didn't talk about this.  They took the little boy, Cobb.
I'll drink to that. Will you join me, Miss --
Thanks. That's what I call it too.
Here he comes right now.
Oh, yeah? How good?
Give me some of the good stuff.
He left me.
Who?
It wasn't her body.  It was her body of work.
I am telling the truth.
I don't know how many times I have to say this, Elaine, but Viktor and I are not in love.  I only make love to the camera.
Thanks.  This is my exit so, I --
I'm glad we talked.
Excuse us.
Difficult.  I'm difficult.
-- Viktor, that was Short Subject.
Please.
You realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
How can I?  Your last three pictures tanked.  The board is giving me hell.  No bankable star will work with you after this.  If you just compromised... a little.
So there's no problem -- I can have the rights, the negative too?
If it's on the page...
She'll do her own.  Theater training.
-- I guarantee she won't gain an once.  She's very disciplined.
Even the fall from the plane.
Better late than never.
-- I don't think that's necessary. I think it's perfectly clear.  I should have guessed -- it all makes sense now... it's why she never goes anywhere, never seen in public...
Oh, yes.  Of course.  Don't I always?
No, of course not!  Why?  Would you care if we were?
Thank you.
Do what?
Yes, you do...  Anyway, tonight was a good start.
Impossible.
Every actor is an invention, Viktor.  Don't embarrass yourself. No one's denying that you discovered Simone.  But it's like finding a diamond in the desert. Anyone can trip over it, but it's not the finder who sparkles.
Where are you?
Right beside you.  I borrowed Viktor's car.
What I do to Simone?
You're with me to be close to her?
Hello, Hal.
You want me to call Security?
That's right.  You were booed off the stage.  That's got to be -- ?
-- Eight years ago.  In that whole time, I never left my computer.
I'm sorry.
-- We call them "vactors".
-- Flesh is weak.
You saw that?
I've seen every frame of your work. You're the only filmmaker in Hollywood with the artistic integrity to realize my vision. You and me, art and science... we are the perfect marriage.
You look very grown up.  What are you doing?  You meeting your mom for dinner?
She can't watch herself.
I saw her picture on the, er... internet.  You really didn't notice anything -- unusual?
Why?
Really?  Who?  Where do you meet them?  In a chat room?  How do you know he's not some middle-aged freak?
Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away.
I do okay.  How about you?
Too impersonal.  They have to meet face-to-face.
I love you too, daddy.
An insanity defence.
Max Sayer -- National Echo.
Nice try.  If we can't get to her through you, maybe your family will be more co-operative.  I can guarantee you, Taransky, one way or another, Miss Simone and I are going to get acquainted.
Er,... good.
She hasn't uttered a word that whole time -- until she saw the big show.
Sometimes you have to tell a small lie to get to the bigger truth.  As for a photo -- if you can't do it, I know twelve million people who can.
-- Cashier's check went out to our anonymous tipster this morning -- worth every penny too.  Who says there's no place for checkbook journalism?  We'll be running stills of this for months, then release the whole tape -- we'll get our money back -- maybe show it on an exclusive pay-per-view event. Do you realize what we have here? We have the only independent footage of Simone in existence.
You're in breach.
Thank you.
-- What you don't understand --
You're right.  You're right.  Of course, one doesn't want to boast. It's a classic case of technology in search of an artist.  That's all you've been waiting for, an artist with integrity, with a vision, who can see.
I didn't leave you.
Don't step in the horse manure.
I knew there was a sound explanation.
Not even little ones that aren't supposed to hurt?
No.
That's good.
Next time I won't be scared of you.
Yeah, Private Kinney needed to get back safe to take care of her.
That I'm a freak.
Who me?
Yes.
Cats?
Maybe they wake up that morning thinking they have a thousand things to do and a thousand days left to do them in... And then all of a sudden, it's all taken away. No one asked them. It's just gone...
Do you know what 'Yo no quiero morir' is?
Don't get mad.
Maybe.
Oh my God.
Dead people?
They talk to you?
They were the ones who hanged everybody.
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
I wish I could be like my momma though. She always knew what was wrong. Knew just what to say.
Which street corner?
No. This is something spiritual. An ambition.
Yeah. It's the alternator all right.
I didn't do anything --
Hell, no. But you missed a damn good sermon. "You can't hide a wicked heart from the eyes of the Lord."
I could. You sucked.
Cowshit? Are you sure the Aztecs even had cows?
Harvest moonshining!
She was talking about... a "harvest of blood"...
-- It's not me!
Amends...?
You don't like my costume? Cool. I'll go with plan B. Which one you like better?
Nothing. I'll have us back on the road in no time.
Yes!
Name something.
I don't think so. Keith's about to use the rooster for target practice. Besides... you didn't seem too interested last night.
Mmmm -- so can I...
You brought us here. And that morning I found you in the barn. You had scratches on your face --
And that makes you look like a squid?
No. Whatâ€?
Well, big ol' Lincoln, sure. Guess I would have flirted with him too.
When you wanted to run away, I called your dad.
Hell, Starla. I always regretted that.
Oh, shit! I hope she ain't a police radio aficionado. If so, I apolog
Shit, girl, you couldn't'a been eleven.
Grant? Why are there -- did you put locks on the garage?
I loved you. I loved --
Through a wound on his stomach?
And you said the worms are part of him. They're all linked, like one creature?
An animal that doesn't procreate. It spreads, grows. A living disease.
Gold--digger, huh?
Not that I don't have any respect for the law, but what's your problem, man?
All sound reasons for matrimony.
Why? You have a bowling date?
I never looked at it that way.  You ask a lot of questions.
A what?
You have a great profile.
Shoot.
Yeah.
Promise me you won't fall in love with an inmate.
Because I need your help, sweet thing.  And I need it bad.
No what?
Quit being so negative, guy; 'course we're gonna make it. We ain't never not made it, have we?
Go.
If I say go to twenty-one, go to nineteen.
Yeah?
Can a pig whistle?
If I knew, Cledus; I'd be on College Bowl.
On its way. Give me a coupla minutes, okay?
Not good enough to be standing here shooting the bull.
We're gone.
Anything else you don't want me to know?
Nope. Just keep those wheels churning.
I'll believe it when I see it.
You're coming up to the scale house.
Pick it up, Breaker.
About one to five years worth.
I'll keep my eyeballs peeled.
Now, you just find him, son.
Chickenshit money.
-- Did ya hear they nailed the Bandit?
And everybody, all the time. Yeah, it's a chore.
That's correct.
You have a butler working that floor?
Is your security team armed?
Well... This is as good a place for it as any I guess.
Have them mobilized. I'll phone security and have the elevators locked down and stairwells secured. We need to keep Israel sequestered in that penthouse.
No.  I'm going over there. You take the car from there, get out to the lake.
-- run both those names through the D.C. database. Call San Francisco, see if they've got anybody in the field doing collateral inquiries for --
-- he was wearing one of our jackets.
And when you saw him later, he was wearing one of your security jackets --
If I needed your I.D. and your car and me and my brothers were wanted by the law, I woulda killed you to get 'em too.
That's not possible. I told you.
I said I got his machine.
We're hot, and they're losing a whole floor's worth of business saying it's "under construction."
His testimony has the potential of blowing the lid off what's left of the La Cosa Nostra is this country. That alone warrants total immunity from prosecution and and a vanishing act with Witness Protection.
Yes. The actual contract went to Lazlo Soot, the man that plunged to his death from the Penthouse yesterday. He was to neutralize Israel's entourage and prep for the removal of his heart. Ingstrom was to handle the surgery itself on-site with the assistance of Dr. Gregory Gill, Israel's personal physician, who was also on the Sparazza payroll.
...Yeah, fifty-three.
Y'gotta, y'gotta. But d'ya think they'll kick ransom for that little prick, assuming we get to'm.
Well just so I got a quote in my head. What's the rate for the Swede?
A million flat.
Right, you got clicks, anything?
Well, uh -- damn, alright, so he's headed in, does that -- where does that leave us?
-- I don't know, I feel like you always pushin' up on me, gettin' close and I love you baby, in every way you can love a bitch, 'cept that one.
What else did Padiche say?
Right mafuck'n now girl. Fast as we can get you there. We wait any longer, someone goin' dead this fool.
The same thing that could happen to any of us.
Listen --
Why, who did you see?
That depends.
I'm not sure.  It started with Gibarian.  He locked himself in his room and refused to talk except through a crack in the door.  He covered the video lens. Obviously we thought he was having a nervous breakdown.  I don't know why he didn't tell us he had somebody in there.  By this time, we were getting visitors, too.  He was desperately trying to figure it out.  Day and night.  Who was she?
But why is it doing what it's doing? Given it's resources, it could have done anything.  Presented me with your double, and you with mine.
That's right.  And we all have to sleep, eventually.
No.
What plan?
You'll see her die, that's all. They're mortal, despite what she told you.  She will die.  Then what will you do?
But I can't leave with you.  I won't make it.
And tonight?
You talk like an actor.
Is it intelligent?
You still don't believe in God?
I been thinking about how much I hate you.
How old were you?
It's genetics.  You know this.  You know where it comes from.  There is nothing wrong with uncrossing a few crossed wires.
I know.  I'm putting that in my next report.
You feel sorry for Solaris, or for me?
It's a violent response to something we haven't figured out.  Don't let the cowardly demeanor fool you: He is ruthless.  Unblinking in his prejudice.
Stop.
Rheya.
Don't.  I'm the one at risk here. If we're playing out what happened before, I won't survive.
Don't call me that.
That's impossible.  I'm not Rheya.
They do something to me.  It's hard to think straight.
It's okay... I've never been a detective before either...
Hey!  There are crazy people here.
Let's get a drink.
I'll come with you.
Listen, that was my fault.
Hmm...
Nope... never finished one yet.  I hate these things.
You were reading my Renoir.
No, no seriously!  There's a study done on this, you walk this way, the muggers are gonna single you out.
So it was "love".
I do care about you!
More bullshit!  More bullshit!  What kind of odds are they giving me?  There must be some kind of office pool.  One month?  A couple of days?
Okay, then let's make it easy.  It was a mistake.  Don't make me feel guilty now that it's over, let's forget about it.
Oh God, that's great!
Listen, you're right.  Don't do it. I'll just... send you an address, okay?
I've been doing a lot of thinking.
Yeah.  It's all over.
I do.
What am I supposed to do?!  I saw one of my oldest friends get killed! And I saw who did it!  I can't just -- "let it go away"!!
What are you talking about?
You got a great ass!  I love your ass -- now get that falling ass into bed before it hits the floor.
Imagine... I'm sleepin' with a DT.
Just keep it someplace safe, but handy.
Unbelievably handsome.  You look fantastic in a suit.
Because the the only way to stop crime is to identify criminals.  I can't believe you're talking this way Mister Detective -- I think she's got a lot of guts.
I might stop you.
It's not your fault.  Mike, please get off the case.
I'm sorry.
I'd like you to switch to the day shift, Mike.  To be home for dinner. Helen insists that T.J. be home for dinner... That's why he's on the morning shift.
Erect.  You know, a "boner?"  I'd heard that it gives you a boner, to shoot a man.
I don't really see what that has to do with...
Why should she come in?
I'm not lettin' no one go.
So, what are you doing tonight?
I don't think she can sing, either.
Take care, pal.
At least this ensemble doesn't glow in the dark.
I know.  Still thinking about retiring?
S'funny.  When your mom and dad, uh, passed away, I had this idea. I wanted you to be the best baseball player in the world.
Remember Little League?
Cause if you get in a bind--
I'm always here, Pete.
No, no, listen. They're tryin' to say he was in cahoots with this killer--
Harryâ€
Mm-hmm.
I think you're trying to tell me something.
Gimme that.  Pick it up later.
Uh-huh. Look, this should be skintight.  Bright colors.  Red, maybe a deep midnight blue.
I see.  So, Amazing Spider-Man-- I'll assume that's not your given name--
Fill in the blank: "I blank Elizabeth Allan."
I lov-loathe Elizabeth Allan. Abhor, detest, despise--
Thank God.
You want to give them something, but they'll just buy more Ripple. And they smell so... bad.
Eugene.  Admit it, Peter-- you'd do anything for a nickname like "Flash."
Hurry up, Flash!
Oh, don't do it on my account--
Why?
So you've found Thorkel?
Yeah, that's fascinating, but I'm just a fat, dumb cop lookin' for a psycho killer--
Einstein, right?  We'll see ya.
Nope.  Maybe he skipped to Rio. Feds got troops surrounding every cyclotron on the continent.  Are you absolutely positive that one at E.S.U. is kaput?
You were adorable.  The least you could do is use a glass.
How is he?
Perhaps. But every now and then someone pays attention.  You did.
I heard about Thorkel's order--
I left a paper in my desk.
All right, we may be insignificant, imperfect creatures-- but we're all we've got.
Oh, Roz.  My mind is so far beyond yours now.  I could beat you at chess now.
You never know.  Go get some sleep.
Yup.  Oh, here's your check, minus my commission.  Solid, solid novelty act.
And blow up the universe just to prove he's right?  Bit egotistical, isn't it?
Roger.
I don't know anymore.
Look, this may be my last hot breakfast on account of they're going to take away that stove. So will you let me eat it in peace?
Don't wear it out!
It's on me.
I'll live.
I don't know what you're talking about, Colonel.
You will remember the name? Von Scherbach? VON SCHER-BACH!
How long is temporarily? I trust not until July.
I want to talk about Lieutenant Dunbar. Is this Lieutenant Dunbar?
He is a prisoner of war until you can prove sabotage.
You should live so long.
Raus! Raus! All of you!
I'm telling you, Animal, these Nazis ain't Kosher.
I'm telling you, Animal -- these Nazis ain't Ko --
Sharp. Sometimes I'm so sharp it's frightening.
Animal! Animal! Wake up!
Curtains would do wonders for this barrack.  You will not get them.
We'll take care of Schulz.  Come on.
Because that's where he is. In the water tank.
Sometimes I think he is fooling us with that crazy business.
We did it.
There better not be anything missing. This is private property.
So who stays with me? Maybe Joey? No -- not Joey. Wouldn't you feel safer with Security on the job?
He's a Nazi, Price is. For all I know, his name is Preismaier or Preissinger. Sure, he lived in Cleveland, but when the war broke out he came back to the Fatherland like a good little Bundist. He spoke our lingo so they put him through spy school, gave him phony dogtags --
Price. When I go I want you to give me five minutes. Exactly five minutes to get Dunbar out of that water tank. Then you throw Price out into the compound, nice and loud. He'll draw every light from every goon tower. It's our only chance to cut through. What do you say, Barracks' Chief?
Check.
You can tell Father Murray to --
I'll tell you how come.  The Barrack Chief gave them the green light. And you, our Security Officer, said it'd be safe. That's how come.
Go where? To the Kommandant's office and tell him where Dunbar is?
Ach, terrible! Such foolish boys. Such nice boys. I'd better not talk about it. It makes me sick to my stomach.
Give me the radio.
And how about three hundred cigarettes for yourself?
Talk what? I do not know anything!
Not particularly.
Ja! Ja! Droppen Sie dead!
Always joking. Always making wisecrackers!
I don't know. He bathed, now he is roaming the ship. He must be the only Engineer in Starfleet who does not go to Engineering!
When is it expected back?
Give me a list of those effects. I want to know every single thing which has been altered or changed, no matter how insignificant.
What do you mean?
I believe so.
Approximately two hundred thirty million.
Sorry, sir.  There is too much interference in the planet's ionosphere for an accurate reading.
I know. I just got it.  It was very funny.
We all are, Data. But we're going to get him back.
Perhaps.  Yes! If we sent a low-level ionic pulse, it might reset the coil and engage the cloaking systems.
You're in the Nexus.
All of us.
It's our pleasure.
Please, I insist.
Not exactly. As I said, this is some kind of-
Better?
This is my uncle's barn in Iowa.
That's right.
Did we do it? Did we make a difference?
Sir, is there anything wrong?
You may still. Somehow I doubt this will be the last ship to carry the name Enterprise.
Thank you.
I do not see how. The plasma coil is part of their cloaking device.
Mr. Chekov, I ordered Spock's quarters sealed!
Sir. Commander, Starfleet on emergency channel. He orders you to surrender this vessel.
On screen.
Sector two... Indicating desert terrain. Minimal vegetation, temperature thirty-nine point four.
All the varieties of land and weather known to Earth within a few hours walk!
Negative, on surface... A manufactured object.
... Or <u>who</u>.
David --
That may be difficult...
Request permission to beam aboard immediately.
None that I can detect, sir.
Gentlemen... may the wind be at our backs. Stations please!
They've knocked out the damn automation center.  I've got no control over anything!
Just him, sir!
Much is at stake...
Because... the needs of the one outweighed the needs of the many.
Yes, sir. It's getting larger as we close in.
Fire, Mr. Scott!
About a dozen officers and men.
What about surface life signs...?
Go, Sulu!
Best speed to Vulcan. Mr. Chekov, take the prisoners below.
No, sir, no response.
Good evening, Commander. Everything ready?
Yes, Admiral. Step into my parlor.
Genesis?! Whatever for?
Wait! Give me a chance --
But he couldn't touch me...! We were separated!
What must I do?
Good.  This is the turn of luck I have been waiting for.
Perhaps they wish to take you prisoner.
<U>We are Klingons</U>! Once you control the ship, I will transfer my flag there. And we will take Genesis from their own memory banks!
Say thank you.
He's BEEN there and hasn't found what he wants. Can you spare someone? There may be people hurt.
Then this will be your big chance to get away from it all.
It's like the Garden of Eden...
We each face death every day we're alive, Saavik.
I have my orders.
Jim please --
Mother, go back!
There's an air-lock.
Umm. And would Admiral Kirk have access to such information?
What?
But good words. That's where ideas begin. Maybe you should listen to them.
I am truly sorry.
Let them eat static.
Sir, we must!  We must repair the damage. Enterprise will wait; she's not going anywhere.
Visual --
Rake her.
What is the meaning of this attack? Where is the crew of the Reliant?
Here it comes. Now, Spock.
Chekov, who is this man?
Aye, sir --
A few shots, sir.
Mr. Scott, the word is given.
Aye, sir.
He wants to kill me for passing sentence on him 14 years ago -- and he doesn't care who stands between him and his vengeance.
He'll die -- !
Than you. Yes, I see that. By the way, thank you for this.
Welcome aboard, Admiral. I believe you know my trainee crew. Certainly they have come to know you.
Yes, we've been through death and life together.
Like all living beings, Admiral each according to his gifts. The ship is yours.
I would not presume to debate you.
It might help my analysis if I knew what Genesis was.
It's all we've got.
Uhura, patch me in --
Spock...!
Uhura, if you don't hear from us, there won't be anybody behind. Kirk out.  You gentleman can remain here, or...
It is still regulation, Admiral.
You may ask, Lieutenant.
They just don't want us going in there.
Dismiss the company.
I cut your new orders personally. By the end of the month, you'll have your first command: USS EXCELSIOR.
Stop engines.
Visual.
Scotty!
Inform the Klingons we are on a rescue mission...
Honors -- hup!
Thank you, Mr. Saavik.
I exaggerated.
I know. I feel the same thing. But we're between a rock and a hard place. We can't keep them without risking their lives and we can't let them go without a taking the same chance.
Yeah.
Not at all. You gave me things to think about. You always do. You do sound a little wrecked, why don't you go home and stare at the ceiling?
Indeed... May I offer you gentlemen anything?
A moment alone, please.
We could learn a thing or two from this flea trap. It has a cloaking device that cost us a lot.
We've done it before.
If you have a better idea - now's the time.
Cramps.
Well nobody's perfect...
My God, man, drilling holes in his head is not the answer. The artery must be repaired without delay or he will die! So put away your butcher knives and let me save the patient!
The top of what?
I do not know your name.
You play games with me and you're through
And Admiral, it's the Enterprise.
How soon?
The hell you were, buster. Your friend was messing up my tank and messing up my whales...
A landlubber. Come on, what the hell were you boys really trying to do back there? Was it some kinda macho thing? If that's all, I'm gonna be real disappointed. I hate that macho type.
Can I ask <u>you</u> something?
Very likely. You're not exactly catching us at our best.
Good.  A large mushroom and pepperoni with extra onions. And a Michelob.
How will that be done, exactly?
They'll be flown in a special 747 to Alaska and released there.
I'm all ears.
So. There we are.
You can't. Our next stop is the 23rd Century.
I belong here.  Suppose by some miracle you do get them through.  Who in the 23rd Century knows anything about Humpback whales?
You're going to your ship, I'm going to mine. Science Vessel. I've got 300 years of catch-up learning to do.
It would be improper to refer to you as Jim while you are in command, Admiral... Also, I must apologize for my attire.  I seem to have misplaced my uniform.
Is there any other planet where this species exists?
The Humpback was indigenous to Earth. Earth of the past.
I have.
Judging by the pollution content of the atmosphere, I believe we have arrived at the late 20th Century.
Explain.
We could rig a device to collect their high energy photons safely; we could then inject the photons into the dilithium chamber, causing crystalline restructure.... Theoretically.
Admiral, may I ask you a question?
Why not?
I cannot tell a lie.
The hell I can't
I believe I was successful in communicating our intentions.
Damn.... Damnit! We've been so lucky. We have the two perfect whales in our hands, but if we don't move quickly, we'll lose them!
No data, Admiral. Computers are non-functional.
Go, Mr. Sulu.
Uhura, you did what was necessary.  Keep trying. You'll find him...
Uhura!... Where!
Give me one more day, sir. The damage control is easy. Reading Klingon is hard.
You'll work it out, Scotty. And remember: two of them.
It takes two to tango, Mr. Scott.
Not good enough, Scotty. You've got to do better!
Aye. But I've never beamed up 400 tons before.
Full power, sir.
And... Here is a deposition I have made. If it is not sufficient, I will return to Earth to testify.
Millions?
I will. Can my assistant come, too?
The keyboard... How quaint.
Most kind, Father.
There are days.
More questions. Always the explorer. If you stay long enough, that'll change.
A perfect moment?
When time seemed to stop... and you could almost live in that moment...
No, I mean...
Safer than leaving her here.
'his nose should pant and his lip should curl...'
I was in an isolation suit collecting physiometric data on Ba'ku children. My last memory is going into the hills, following a boy...
What you're seeing is a computer driven image created by photons and forcefields...
Another time.
Just a few loose ends to tie up. Dougherty out.
Recommendations?
Deploy the collector.
They... are in opposite directions, sir...
It's nothing. I'm just tired.
That's your expert opinion?
The purpose being...?
On screen.
Yes, we do.  You're relieved, Ensign. Take over at Ops.
Commander Riker...
Go back to your quarters  That's an order.
Slow to impulse. We're on our way.
The metaphasic radiation in those rings is in a state of extreme flux. Steer clear of them, Mister Worf...
Debrief them again.  Have you been in a fight, Commander?
You should feel right at home with them.
Good question.
Was I doing something to your neck?
No children?
All ship functions are off-line.
They must have been locked and secured after we were beamed here.
Are you saying they won't help us?
If they're not... we'd better get used to living in Montana.
It is impossible to imagine sensations for which I have no frame of reference.
I do not know what you are referring to.
I wish to... go back to the way I was.
Then take the final step... give me the Enterprise... and we can be together... always.
No... no, please... you cannot...
Contact Starfleet Command.
I am the Borg.
That is a contradiction. The Borg act as a collective consciousness. There are no individuals.
Where?
Let's go.
There should be some kind of manual release...
It'll have to wait. Come on.
Bring the warp core on-line. I'll lay in a heading.
I've enhanced the plasma injectors -- don't worry, they'll see it.
Oh... here and there. You know how it is.
The invasion plans.
What makes you say that?
Are you always sucha good judge of character?
That's impossible.
Population... thirty-five billion...  All Borg.
We have to follow them back... repair whatever damage they've done to that time-line.
I guess I'd better get it right the first time.
There's a dampening field in place on this deck. Our tricorders are useless.
Can you - ?
We're not finished.
She didn't need our help getting anywhere... where did she get these convenient clothes? And don't tell me that flare is standard prison issue...
Killed trying to escape - it's a classic...
Now there's a poser.
We were until your torpedoes!
Aside from a touch of arthritis, I'd say pretty good.
That we fired two photon torpedoes. But -
Yes...
Captain Sulu... on assignment... anyone seen Spock?
I know what you mean...
Do we report this, sir?
Are you kidding?  Send to Starfleet Command...
Chancellor. We've been ordered to escort you through Federation space to your meeting place on Earth.
Kronos, sir?
We have volunteered to rendezvous with the Klingon ship that's bringing Chancellor Gorkon here, and escort him safely through Federation space.
DON'T TRUST THEM. DON'T BELIEVE THEM -
I am uncertain.
Spock, I'm really tired...
According to the data bank, we HAVE - twice...
Not yet... Section 4236...
Faith...?
An error.
We've been ordered to -
Signal Starfleet that... we have no idea location of Enterprise.
Sir?
Visual!
I know precisely where he'll be.
If another ship had been beneath us the Klingons would've seen her!
Would they?
This one can.
Aye, aye, sir.
Because you are dangerous.
For how long?
About twenty-five years ago. They probably used a hair follicle or skin cell.
Yes.
Not tonight, I have work here.
Now, you make a toast.
Mister Worf, accompany Data please.
At our current velocity we will arrive at sector 3274 in approximately 40 minutes.
No, sir, it is not possible. The B-9 is physically identical to me, although his neural pathways are not as advanced. But even if they were, he would not be me.
Yes, sir. The Rift effects all long-range communications.
Sir.
Why?
How many of you did Dr. Soong make?
Dr. Soong must have found it unnecessary in later versions.
It's possible the extra memory port is interfering with the engram processing. Mind if I keep him here and run some diagnostics?
Why is it moving?
Do you have a moment, sir?
And I you.
I don't know.
I not only know him, Deanna, I am him.. and he is me!
Do you have life support?

What do we know about the planet?
As I remember, Thalaron research was banned in the Federation because of its bioqenic properties.
Weâ€™ve got him!
Not with the Romulans.
Listen to him, android. Such a small and weak creature. Yet he roars so valiantly...
I look forward to the sport.  Take him.
Who was it?
On my way. Please notify Commander Riker.
His hatred of the Federation is apparent. He would have built a weapon of that scope for one reason. He is going after Earth.
And the Romulans invade.
I promise you in time, she'll become your home ...If I could offer you one piece of advice?
It's about destiny, Picard. About a Reman outcast who...
We are.
It's just the two of us now, Jean Luc, as it should be... Your ship and mine... You and me.
You know that's not possible.
So if I gave you my life, what would you do with it? Would you spend the years in a blaze of hatred as you are now? Or could you change? Could you try to remember a mother's touch you never felt? A father's words you never heard? Could you do that?
We're being hailed.
He's gentler than I thought. And he has a sense of humor.
Fill this out.  Will this be cash or credit card?
No.
They're damned expensive and a pain in the ass sometimes, but I wouldn't trade having them for anything.
They must have picked it up in space.
What do you mean by 'contain?'
We don't think that's necessarily bad. At least it's a point of contact.
We'll get those answers when you find the one you're looking for.
That's not going to happen, George, unless you get us the help you promised us.
We've been back and forth on this all day and keeping in mind the panic that would occur if this got to the general public, it's been decided not to expand the search at this time.
You can speak to me, Mrs. Haydn. I'm in charge of this operation now.
If I don't speak to Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up.
I don't know. Someplace called Elmo's. Look, I just wanted to tell you that I'm all right and I'm on my way home.
Get a highway patrol unit over there.
Is he on his way to Lathrop Wells?
Why are you doing this to me? I'll give you whatever...
Ah no.
Police...
What are you doing?
Gas good?
Closed.
No. I don't know what you are, but you're not Scott.
Candy.
I feel like I'm going crazy here. You're Scott. But he's dead. I don't know what's real anymore. I can't be here with you.
Do you have a baby?
Then don't be smart.
No.
Go?
Goodbye.
Yes?
What?
It was a mistake.
We were doing a map of the stars and all the other things up there when we saw a small ship. My... eh... we kidnapped it. On it there was a map that said how to come to Earth. This was very important. Before then, we thought we were the only people in all the stars.
You did? That's funny. So did we.
Yes?
I don't understand 'friend.'
I understand.
It's bad.
Yes.
I do not want to.
Don't be afraid... I'd really like to hear it.
The police are waiting for you up ahead. There's a roadblock. You have to go back.
I will go. But not you.
I don't want you to be hurt.
You promised you would get me to my ship.
You promised.
We'll get a ride in the morning.
I understand.  Thank you.
You won ten dollars. Big deal. If we don't get a good ride before dark we could miss your ship.
Many of my people will not believe those things are possible. On my planet there is only one government, one people, one language. I will be asked a lot of questions.
If you want to keep it, you can.
Where?
I must go.
You say you love me and kiss me 'goodbye.'
Call the police!!
Don't worry. I'll be all right.
We're ready.
Jesus Lyman, you're an ignorant fool.
Any signs of biological contamination, excessive radiation, anything like that?
I know, but...
I don't understand.
You know that's impossible!
I wouldn't think so.
He's no concern of mine, as long as you don't talk to him.  Don't talk to anybody.  You understand?  Not with everything that's going on right now.
What're you going to do?
Yeah, OK, whatever you say.  Just answer one question.  Is anything wrong?  Iris said you might be in trouble.
You talked to Iris?  When?
Come on, Faith!  He's just toying with you.  And when he gets bored, you'll be yesterday's papers.
Step into my office.
Thanks, Max.
This tie cost more than your entire wardrobe.
That's not sayin' much.
Yup.  So darn lucky.  I wake up with a .22-short floating in my brainpan, and a cop pension I can't live off of.  Good thing I wasn't any luckier.  Bobby!  Another shooter right here!
Thanks, Max.  I'm touched by your concern.
Shutup a second!
Let's work it.
He makes her see her own death, feeds off the reaction... killer and victim merging... orgasm and agony merging.  And he records it all.
Yup.  Hey, so I heard you dropped in on Tran last night.  Another slick Lenny move.
I'm on her, amigo.  No worries. Gotta jam.
Yeah.  So don't walk near me in public, alright.
Only way I could stand your ties.
Sleaze to peddle.
Mace!  You're a life-saver.
So am I.  Just trying to get by.
She still loves me.
Black.  Jack.
Are you sure it's real?
If he could do what's on that tape, he's a sicko.
S'okay.  I know you still love me.
No shit.  You got someplace in mind?
Fire's out, isn't it?
Yeah, me neither.  It was one of my favorites.  Me and Faith in a hot tub on my birthday.  I'm going to really miss it.
I see.  I see the earth opening up and swallowing us all.
Yeah.  You gave up your hot tub tape to save me.  That's real progress for you.
Why didn't he just go public with the tape?  Save himself that way.
Yeah.  We did.
Yeah.  See you there.
Just Lenny.
I'm babysitting the DEA guys this afternoon, Casio and I. You said that was top priority.
Just mopping up. Nine bodies in all.
No, sir.
This isn't in our database?
What's the bad news?
What does the Manager say?
We had to bring staff in from the whole county to handle this.
It's been customized for sleeping capacity.
Fucking. I'm talking about fucking, Harold. You ever think of fucking other women?
Not bad, huh?
Yes.
Let's take a look at it.  Drop off my stuff at the hotel after you're done here.
From the grave?
I might point out, Agent Mackelway, the reason we haven't been able to crack those rooms is that you refused to share that information with us -- which is also why you were reassigned.
Pretty embarrassed, to be honest. I had him.
Collected shoes too?
I can't. The chat room isn't open for another five days.
You have to save this boy. Good exists in this world. I can prove it because you can, in your life, save this one person.
How long have you been downtown?
Five months. I love it.
Why did he come out here? What's going on?
Beats me. He just asked me to come along, double-check the forensics.  What did you do to piss him off?
Sex.
Grown man dressed like a clown. Does he really think he looks good?
When you were his student? Did he come on to you?
You did.
That's true.
Where are you? Everybody's looking for you.
You want to get him? Find something he wants. Get him to come to you.
I guess I'm a little paranoid.
What's going on?
Burn marks. The original M.E. listed it as "burn residue." Same place, the outer thigh, as Karen Sumpter. The UNSUB is able to abduct, kill, transport and bury without detection.
All the same killer?
Kulok.
How's the arm?
He always had a weakness in that area. I saw it the first time I met him. We all had our weaknesses, I guess. Daitz wanted the money. With Dave it was the glory. Koessler saw the Behavioral Sciences Unit as a stepping stone to bigger and better bureaucratic things. He had his eye on the Director's job, even then. Catching killers was a means to an end for them.
Of course not. They're possibles. I've checked them against Bureau records, check them against your file. How did you get it?
You did. You were with her when she disappeared, right? She took you to the mall or the movies, you turn around and she's gone.
Those were just fantasies.
[Follow me.]
Haven't had any, but I'm willing to try.
[Ask for Leslie. Eight days from tonight, exactly one a.m. Be there if you dare. You cannot fool the Murman.]
[Don't jerk a jerk-off. There's nothing in the Bureau mainframe.]
What did you do to end up here?
Jesus, just what I need, another blue flamer.  Johnny, get this boy some sun screen.
Hope you never do. At first it feels like a sauna, by the time you hit victim four it's a fucking burning shirt factory.
Eight, nine months ago. When I was at Computer Crime. I got into a chat room with someone named MyDick. I'd talked to him before. Everything I saw yesterday, everything in the autopsies, it's identical. The forensics are dead on. MyDick's fantasies involved a hog-tie rig, nylon cord, torture with pliers, rip the nipples -- when the "item" screams, she chokes. He had a thing about eyes, always the eyes -- stab their eyes. It's the same guy. Speck was MyDick.
I talked to him.
This man, Hawkins, has killed dozens of people. Suspect Zero.
You're money, baby.
What kind of car do you drive?
I'm sorry, I couldn't help it. Let me make it up to you.
...maybe...
What's that like?
Yes! Remember? You asked me for an application? I introduced you to the manager?
You too?
How?
No.
I'm a comedian.
Yes, but I'm afraid this table has a hundred-dollar-minimum bet. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable at one of our lower stakes tables.
Oh? You know about booking agents... I don't, uh, actually have a west coast agent as of yet...
Sure, I guess. The phone's in the back.
Me too.
If and when I get a real gig I'll call you.
...get the hell outta here already...
Are you on the other line?
...Six months.
No, he's not... Listen I don't want to talk about him. That's a whole other headache. I called because I heard you might be moving back to Queens...
Why?
Well, until now. Tend the pin.
That doesn't sound too good for business.
Ah, there's the rub...
Well, you're doing so well...
Wow.  You wanna grab a bite?
No, man, we're in the play-offs.
Hey, man, you're not from here. You don't know how it is. I grew up in L.A...
...People get carjacked...
What about you, Mikey? At least I got balls. You're always whining about some bitch who dumped you a year ago...
Thanks, man.  I've been hating myself for the last two days.
Hi, Nikki. This is Mike, again. I just called because it sounded like your machine might've cut me off before I gave you my number, and also to say sorry for calling so late, but you were still there when I left the Dresden, so I knew I'd get your machine. Anyway, my number is... 
Hi, Nikki. This is Mike again. Could you just call me when you get in? I'll be up for awhile, and I'd just rather talk to you in person instead of trying to squeeze it all... 
You got it bad, baby. You need Vegas.
Vegas.
They're all skanks.
It doesn't matter...
You're gonna screw up our plan.
Who's fucking around? I'm not making fun. Let's do it, baby.
Always, baby.
Baby, you're money. You're the big winner.
Who's the big winner?
Okay, Tee's the asshole, but Mikey's the big winner.
That was money. Tell me that wasn't money.
Leave? The honey-baby's bringing us some cocktails.
I heard them talking. They both thought you were money.
I just don't think she liked me in that way.
What?!?
Yeah.
No, baby!
A day.
I took a ballroom class with Michelle. I never danced with anyone but her, til tonight. That Lorraine chick is good.
Fuck!!! That is so bullshit!
No.
Is she looking now?
What was cold about it?
You think?
...and fangs... and you're like "I don't know what to do. How do I kill this bunny?"...
Now go over there and get those digits.
...Yeah. But two's enough not to look anxious...
Yeah, but three days is kinda the money...
I know for a fact you haven't, because you never shut up about it. You're like a little whiney bitch...
Yes, I understand I'm listening.
I ask for Justice.
But your daughter is still alive.
Then take the justice from the judge, the bitter with the sweet, Bonasera.  But if you come to me with your friendship, your loyalty, then your enemies become my enemies, and then, believe me, they would fear you...
Some day, and that day may never come, I would like to call upon you to do me a service in return.
Like hell I will.
Paulie's been a little sick all winter...he was home.
Go get Paulie, I don't care how sick he is.  Pick him up yourself, and bring him to my father's house.
You won't see Paulie anymore.  He's sick for good this winter.
Probably all the other families will line up against us.  But, it's alright.  These things have to happen once every ten years or so...gets rid of the bad blood. You gotta stop 'em at the beginning. Like they shoulda stopped Hitler at Munich, they shoulda never let him get away with that, they were just asking for big trouble...
Sure.
Drive while you thinking; I wanna get to the City this month!
The Tattaglias will guarantee your investment also.
He owns the studio.  Just a month ago he bought the movie rights to this book, a best seller.  And the main character is a guy just like me.  I wouldn't even have to act, just be myself.
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.
The Senator called--apologized for not coming personally, but said you'd understand.  Also, some of the Judges...they've all sent gifts. And another call from Virgil Sollozzo.
And with prison record.
No.  Let the people enjoy him.  You see?  He is a good godson.
They'll cut the cake in a few minutes...leave right after that. Your new son-in-law, do we give him something important?
Tattaglia is a pimp.  He could never have outfought Santino.  But I wasn't sure until this day.  No, it was Barzini all along.
For bravery.
I'm going to finish school.
I want children, I want a family. But I don't know when.
I could accept everything that's happened; I could accept it, but that I never had a choice.  From the time I was born, you had laid this all out for me.
What else do you believe in?
There are men in this world who demand to be killed.  They argue in gambling games; they jump out of their cars in a rage if someone so much as scratches their fender. These people wander through the streets calling out "Kill me, kill me."  Luca Brasi was like that. And since he wasn't scared of death, and in fact, looked for it...I made him my weapon.  Because I was the only person in the world that he truly hoped would not kill him.  I think you have done the same with this man.
Yes.
Come Sunday morning:  My name is Vitelli and my house is up there on the hill, above the village.
That's easy to say; it's not your father.
OK forget it, just stay on the phone.
We should hear what they have to say.
I know now.  I'll make them call me Don.
A week from tonight.  In Brooklyn on Tessio's ground, where I'll be safe.
They're waiting to see my father.
They're talking to themselves.
My brother Sonny found him living in the streets when he was a kid, so my father took him in.  He's a good lawyer.
Shhh, you be the long distance operator.  Here.
Hello...this is Long Distance.  I have a call from New Hampshire.  Mr. Michael Corleone.  One moment please.
I'm thinking about it.
Please say it.
Can I go to the hospital with you?
Connie and Carlo want you to be godfather to their little boy.
I know I'm not the man he was.  But I'll tell you this and he'll tell you too.  When it comes to real action, I can operate as good as anybody short range.
The Turk wants to talk!  The nerve of that son of a bitch!  After he craps out last night he wants a meet.
The kid's right.
Right.  Don't say my name, just listen.  Somebody shot your father outside his place fifteen minutes ago.
Is he alive?
I think so, but I can't get close enough.  There's a lot of blood. I'll try to find out more.
I just woke up. I'm sorry.
Well, we ate everything without you.
We?
Marge, Ripley's saying goodbye.
Okay, darling.
It's Tom. Tom Ripley. We were at Princeton together.
Well, I knew you, so I suppose you must have known me.
Now? Okay. Wait a minute. Talent --  The only talent my son has is for cashing his allowance.
Stop! It's too much! You're making all the hairs on my neck stand up!
I met him in New York.
See Venice and die, isn't that right? Or is it Rome? You do something and die, don't you? Okay, Venice is on the list.
You're breaking my ribs!
The mysterious Mr Ripley. Marge and I spend hours speculating.  Cold beer. Thank you Dad.
She can do that stuff for you. Anyway, just wear some of my things, wear anything you want, most of it's ancient. 
Well we certainly know that's true.
I can't, how can I, in all decency? We've had a good run, haven't we?
To Mongi. You're cheerful tonight.
What?
Hardly.
I've always wanted to go to Europe, sir, but...
Good. Now you can go for a reason.
I'll try my best, sir. Obviously I'll do anything to help Dickie.
And his passport photo? Did you hear? To scratch out your own face like that -- can you imagine -- the frame of mind you'd have to be in?  I've thought about going to the police but I can't face it. I can't face anything anymore.
What a waste of lives and opportunities and --
Why do you think Dickie's father sent him to Europe in the first place? Did you know at Princeton Dickie Greenleaf half-killed a boy?
My fiancÃ©e.
Sure.
I'll go.
How are you? Sorry. Is your book going well?
I think you're right.
Really? That's swell. No, I was just -- you're way ahead of me! Great!
Dickie?
He's having an early night.
Why do you have Dickie's rings?
I don't believe you.
He's not coming till the morning. Evidently his stomach -- I don't think the food here is agreeing with him.
Excuse me?
Trying not to be. Trying to jump ship.
As in the Textile Logues. Trying to shrug off the dress. I travel under my mother's name, too.
I've never admitted that to anyone.
Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.
I don't -- is that by the Spanish Steps?
Exactly. 10.30 -- 
Hardly. I couldn't be less alone.
And co. A lot of co. Oh, God, I've thought about you so much.
Are you a homosexual?  Interesting non-sequitur.
But the point is Dickie -- well we know this -- Dickie loves Marge and he misses her and apparently he's come to his senses...
It's ridiculous but now you've mentioned the stench I can hardly breathe.
Probably. In my case it's probably a whole building.
Nothing.
Hardly kissing. Kissing off.
Or Tom and Peter even.
I know. I'm lost, too. I'm going to be stuck in the basement, aren't I, that's my, that's my -- terrible and alone and dark -- and I've lied about who I am, and where I am, and so nobody can ever find me.
So, the Doctor, he has to make the --  -- come se dice?
Well, he certainly wasn't dead when he drove off in his car.
My scooter. I fell off. Getting chased by photographers.
No. Here is a pattern. Two days ago Freddie Miles is dead -- he leaves your apartment and is murdered. Yesterday a little boat is found in San Remo full of rocks, and the owner tells the Police it was stolen on November 7th. We look at hotel records and we see oh! Dickie Greenleaf is staying in San Remo and then our boatman remembers two Americans taking a boat.
I'm not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends.
Absolutely.
That's the Colt .25 -- a fine little gun. Don't do a lot of damage, but it's as fast as the Devil. Handy little gun, you can carry it almost anywhere. I'll throw it in for another $125.
How much to get a permit to carry?
You want to canvass?
If you don't mind, mam, I'd be mighty pleased if you'd go out and have some coffee and pie with me.
All right.  All right. I'm taking a break at four o'clock. If you're here then we'll go to the corner and have some coffee and pie.
I shut the meter off, for one thing. I knew I wasn't going to get paid. Then I dropped him off at the cop shop. They took him.
That's really something.
Late one night. About three. At the plaza.
You'd be surprised how often you see the same people, get the same fare. People have patterns. They do more or less the same things every day. I can tell.
It keeps ya busy.
I didn't mean that, Travis. Just the part about the contradiction.
Yeah, well my stereo player is broke. But I'm sure the record is OK.
Your stereo broke? God, I could hardly stand that. I live on music.
I don't follow music much. I'd like to though.  Honest.
No, these are the kind that couples go to. They're not like the other movies. All kinds of couples go. Honest. I've seen them.
You mean these are the only kind of movies you go to?
My God!
No, I don't feel so good. We're just two very different kinds of people, that's all.
Huh?
Hello, Betsy.
The senator's white paper is almost ready, Bets. Should we wait for that?
Kidding around... you know, fun.
No. I just wanted to see if you could light it that way. The guy at the newsstand can.
Well, If he had been Italian, they could have been shot off. Sometimes the mob does that to teach guys a lesson, If they blow a job or something.
Why don't they leave a pigeon instead of a canary?
No.
The cops and company raise hell they find out.
For a fee.
It's easy to remember. Easy Lay.
I musta been stoned.
I think so. I tried to get into your cab one night, and now you want to come and take me away.
I'm sorry, Iris. I didn't mean that.
You're not much with girls, are you?
You don't have to.
Damn straight.
There's porno theatres for that.
Also clean.
Twenty-six.
Education?
So I hear.
I've seen a lot of suspicious-looking people around here today.
You would, huh?
Anything you say, officer.
I'm here to see Iris.
Well, I just, you know...
You want to talk about it?
I join the F.B.I. I ask for fieldwork.  They say, "Bill, you're too fucking= smart for field work." Every year I put in for a transfer and every year I= sit in that goddamn lab like the fucking Maytag repairman in the= commercial.  Then the call finally comes, and it's a whole fuckin, city at= stake?  Oh Jesus...
I'm not a field agent, all right?  So cut me a break.
Well... let me tell you, I'm not Luke.  I know who I am now, and you don't.  And... I don't like me very much.
Come on, Delly, look at the country today.  We're fighting communists in Korea, we're paranoid about the Russians, we've got this thing with the Rosenbergs and the atomic bomb...  You think they want "suspected communists" entertaining the American public with party propaganda like, gosh I don't know, "Sand Pirates of the Sahara?"
Yeah.  Except a chance in hell of coming out of this intact.
Just remember two things.  First, the law is a living thing.  It made us free and it keeps us free. Sometimes it gets twisted around by people for their own purposes. Sometimes it makes mistakes, sometimes big mistakes.  But in the end, the law prevails for the just. Sometimes, it takes a while.
It doesn't seem right, this being down here.  It ought to be where people can see it.
No, you are.  I know exactly what you mean.  It's not that you're missing something.  It's that the other person gives something to you... that you had all the time. You just didn't see it until they came along.
... and It's just... well, deja vu.
Yeah, and needless to say, none of us has that kind of money lying around.
Huh.  That was nice of me.
You had a hidden agenda, though. See, when he was five or six, little Spence used to follow you around like a puppy.  Bothered the hell out of you.  But as soon as you gave him the clarinet...
Nope.  Just filling in the blanks.
That's... pretty frightening.
It never used to be.  You were two left feet on the dance floor.  Like pulling teeth to get you to do a little box step.
Yes, I see that Private Trumbo was reported missing in action and is presumed dead.  I also see that you were posted stateside during the war.  Fort Dix?
Mr. Clyde, I remember everything.
Referring to line thirty-seven of the document, does your printed name and signature appear there?
Mr. Appleton, please tell this committee what was the nature and purpose of the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club?"
Are you asking this committee to believe that you attended a meeting of a communist party front organization in order to impress a girl?
The chair notes that you are appearing without the benefit of counsel today, Mr. Appleton.  We certainly hope this means that you intend to be fully forthcoming with this committee?
A statement?
Ben, when's Delly due back?
No identification at all.  What're you thinkin', Cecil?
What I'm thinkin' is we got us one a'two things here.  A mystery or a damn miracle.  And by god I can't tell which.  Boy, you say you have no idea who you are?  That right?
By all means.
I remember the picture... but I don't remember where I saw it.
Like Ernie said, we're all glad to have you back.
And I hear you and Harry are planning on re-opening the Bijou.
I can only imagine.  You know, I spoke with your Dad last year about maybe taking the Bijou off his hands.  I don't think he gave it very much thought.
Mr. Fitts, with all due respect, I think Lawson needs the Bijou a bit more than it needs a super market. And I think Lawson deserves the Bijou.  There's not a lot that can be done to help us get past the pain we've all felt...
This is the staff of the Bijou.
Well, I'm the first one to admit that I don't know anything about bookkeeping, but there are some very interesting things in here.
Yeah, I know, but poultry...?
Goodnight, son.  'Night, Delly.
Oh, no, I...
... what?
Did you... did you...
Did I what?
Vultures...
What.
Sure, I suppose.  That why you're on a bender?
This is not a bender yet.  This is the start of a bender.  But I can see how you were confused, they look a lot alike.
Sandra Sinclair.
Then I'll call you a cab.
Well, you've been wet to the skin. You must've fallen in.
Lucky you got out, that water's got quite a pull, and it empties straight into the ocean.
It's okay, son.  We just need to call you something.  That's all.
Wish I could say the same thing.
Uh, no... just seeing you standing there, it reminded me... there's a word for it...
Jesus.
Huh?
You should watch what you say.
Yes.  Leo, goddammit... this isn't fair!
Well, that's a relief.  I understand they usually don't let that stop them.
That's not the country Luke fought for.
What do you mean?
Leo, I didn't give them the names. I wouldn't do that.
When was that?
The customers?  I don't know...
Oh.
My girlfriend.  If she still is...
No.  Absolutely not.
It's a lovely garden.
I guess that's where everyone meets him.
Lovebirds.
Yes.
No, it's not the cut that's bothering me.
If you have some, I'd...
Well, I don't suppose it offers much to the casual visitor. Unless you're thrilled by a collection of shacks on a hillside. It takes a while to get used to.
San Francisco.
Annie -- there's nothing between Mitch and me.
When I got back to San Francisco I spent days trying to figure out just what I'd done to displease her.
I don't understand.
And the second?
Look.
Your brother told me.
Oh. Where d'you want the coffee?
I don't know, honey.
It's Alice, ain't it?
Yes, but where?
Right across the bay there.
Where?
I see. How do I get down there?
Nope. That's the road. Straight through town, stay on your left, right around the bay to the front door.
Whose side are you on?
Yes.
I know, Mother.
I think he got a little scratch, Mother.
If there are... larger birds, Mitch... they'll get into the house.
You don't know, you don't know! When will you know? When we're all dead? Like Annie?
If...  If... when we get to San Francisco...  If they're already there?
Do I sound foolish to you?
Try not to think of that, Mrs. Brenner.
Why, Mrs. Brenner?
Eleven. In the middle of the party, some gulls came down at the children. And Miss Daniels was attacked by a gull just yesterday after...
Yes.
Lovebirds, sir?
These are for my sister... her birthday you see. As she'll be eleven and... well, frankly, I wouldn't want a pair of birds that were too demonstrative.
I suppose not. Is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages?
When?
And I'm glad you didn't get your lovebirds!
It deliberately came down at you -- you're bleeding...
Only violators and practical jokers.
Just a few... just a day or two... the weekend.
Yes.
You're sure now? You won't hire a boat or anything?
Without any clothes on?
I think it could be fun.
What about Thursdays and Fridays?
I... I am.  Mitch, is... Mitch, this isn't usual, is it? The gull yesterday when I was in the boat, and the one last night at Annie's, and now...
Of birds?
Certainly, of birds.
I'm frightened and confused and I... I think I want to go back to San Francisco where there are buildings and... and concrete and...
The bay doesn't.
I tried a little while ago. The phone's dead.
What time is it?
No... wait.  Hold me.
I know. Oh, I know.  I've been calling all morning. Oh, you have no idea. Miss Daniels, they're so difficult to get, really they are. We get them from India, you know, when they're just little chicks, and then we have to...
Oh. Oh, well, all right.
Well, all right, but...
No, you'd better send him. May I use your phone?
I might be able to have them by tomorrow morning. Would that be all right?
Thank you.  Do you know Dan Fawcett's number?
I have seen jays doing everything it is conceivable for jays to do. Ornithology happens to be my avocation, Miss Daniels. You're talking about preservation of the species, a hen protecting her young. There's a vast difference between...
Maybe! Is it impossible?
I'm not sure, but...
Makes a lot more sense than... well, an attack.
Take it easy, lady.  There isn't a bird anywhere in sight.
I'm very pleased to know you, Master Fettes.
How could I?  I will do my best. After all, you see, I am financially interested.
I'm only a student.
Gray has no need to threaten. You remember the trial?
There's no standing between a fool and his folly. If you must babble your news to him he's at the Fisherman's Tryst. It's the inn at Pennycuik. You can use MacFarlane's horse and gig to get there. He'll welcome the ride back.
From the Municipal Council -- they're the bodies of paupers --
You're a man of the world, Fettes, you wouldn't hold me to promise given in drink.
Really, Fettes, you irk me with your lack of understanding.
Who would believe that?  And you know, someone else might recognize her.  She was as well known as the Castle Rock.
The little girl -- she couldn't walk far -- the muscles are too weak -- but she did stand and she took a step or two.
Gray -- I'm rid of him --
Tosh!  Fettes!  It's not their grief I'm worrying about -- I'm talking of our own end --
The white horse.  The horse that is going to greet me when he sees me.
One shouldn't get used to the wrong things, Georgina.  You want to walk and run and play.
Don't call me that confounded name.
No.
I can't understand your hurt to me -- but I must cut you out.
You think it'll spoil the boy, eh? Was I not assistant to Knox?
Aye --
Where the fuck did you come from?
Capital case nine nine dash C one one five. Alex Corvis.  Exhibit A.
How can you die if you're already dead?
When Lauren was missing the police came to our house. They said they were looking for her, right?  But I know now they had her, and the reason they brought her here and knew the could blame it on you...
No. You don't.
Erin. I'll always be with you.
Guy dressed for Halloween?
She was eighteen years old! There were four of them. They stabbed her fifty three times! Where's the fucking accident?! Huh?! Where is it?!
Stay in the car. I'll only take a second.
Looks like you have them both on.
Stay away from me! Stay away!
About them. You've got to leave it alone.
It was my intention to discuss this officially -- with all the nations of the Earth -- but I was not allowed the Opportunity. I have come to realize since that your mutual fears and suspicions are merely the normal reactions of a primitive society.  We know from scientific observation that you have discovered a rudimentary kind of atomic energy. We also know that you are experimenting with rockets.
Yes -- that is true.
I wouldn't want you to harm anybody -- or destroy anything.
Tell me what?
Bobby, you've been dreaming again.
You didn't really see the space ship. You just thought you did.
Come on, darling -- we're going up to bed.
I shouldn't be at all surprised.
Wouldn't you like to meet him?
Well, sure I would, but --  Aw, I'll bet you'd be scared.
We can scare him more than he can scare us.
No -- I'm afraid not.
Mr. Carpenter" -- you don't seem to know about anything.
Goodnight.
How does he explain that?
Just Klaatu.
I'm afraid, in the present situation you'll have to learn to think that way.
My mission here is not to solve your petty squabbles. It concerns the existence of every last creature who lives on Earth.
Perhaps if you could explain a little--
Under the circumstances I'm afraid that will be impossible.
There's only one thing -- I haven't been able to arrange for anyone to stay with Bobby.  I don't suppose we could take him with us?
There's always somebody here, but today of course they've all got plans.
How do you know?
You don't understand. You don't realize how important it is.
He told you... Don't be silly, honey -- just because you like the guy.  You realize what this'd mean for us? I'd be the biggest man in the country. I could write my own ticket.
Why not? Somebody's got to get rid of him.
He's a fine boy, Mrs. Benson.
We'll be stuck here for a little while -- about thirty minutes.
Who?
This technique, in certain cases, can re-stimulate life for a limited period. It's a refinement of scientific principles known to your own people.
We came to see Professor Barnhardt.
No -- no, thanks.
That's right.
It's really quite simple... The three- body problem, you know.
It's a pretty cool place if you're a Martian.
We blew it, Edgar!  We lost it!
What's Plan B?
You're eating maggots.  How do they taste?
Sorry, Michael.  No hard feelings, huh?  Here.  Try these noodles.
No, Star.  Put it down.  Put it down.
Are you guys sniffing old newsprint or something?
You think you're cool, don't you? You think you know what's really happening, don't you?  Well, you don't know shit, buddy.
Now I get it... you're like those people in the airport trying to get you to give them money. You're part of a cult.
Hit the lights again.
It's called the Indian walk. Walkin' without makin' a sound.
This is Michael.
Wait a minute, kiddo.
Mom... please.
What's wrong?  Tell me.
You're thinking of the groom not seeing the bride before the wedding.
I don't want to fight with you, Lucy.  Come on.  Let's give it one more try.  Dinner at my house, tomorrow night.  I'm cooking.
Let me tell you something about boys.  They're like weeds.  They grow best when they're ignored.
It's not too late for you to be saved... but each night... it becomes harder and harder for me to resist killing...
I know, I've felt it...
Hey, Sam, we're flat broke.
Even poor people have T.V.s
What would that make Mom?
Don't bother.
No!  We can't tell Mom!  Please, Sam.  Don't tell her.
Just listen.
Well, after I worked on him -- thought I'd let him rest.  Left the room for a bit.  When I came back, he was gone.
You're saying he wasn't put into the kennel until the night?
Nothing.  Nothing at all.
Maybe.
And I don't want any more food with sedatives in it.  I know what you're up to.  Don't think I don't.  And if anyone tries to get in here -- I've got rope.  I'll hang myself before it gets to me.
Watch him close.  Ask him why he didn't kennel the dog.
We'll see...
Don't walk behind me.
He's so close.  Maybe our best chance to blow him away.
Look, I haven't been near that... that refrigerator.
Childs, you got the torch?  You get your ass in here!!
He's gone already!  Do it!
Cut the bullshit... Okay, Sanchez, you come with us.  Norris... you stay here...  Any of them move -- you fry 'em. And if you hear anything, anything at all you let loose the siren.  We all meet back here in twenty minutes regardless.  And everybody watch whoever you're with.  Real close.
We ain't buying that.
It's getting late.  Hurry it.  I'm going to check the last few rooms.
Well, get to it.
You reach anybody yet?
Mac, where the hell is that pump!!
I'm sure a lot of you already know.
What are you going to do?  Drink it?
The generator!
Position, my ass...
Then we go after him.
Bet the last place you ever go.
So what do you make of it?
MacReady, that you?
Can't hear you.
Kalen... Do you have any idea where they take them?
Where?
Please, just listen to me... Your mother would be very cross with me if you got hurt.  I'll find her.
I'm the librarian.  I've always been the librarian.
How have you survived so long?
Can you show us where they live?
Why should I help you?  You primates -- you great, lumbering, hairy animals, drenched in blood from the moment of your hideous conception -- what have you ever used knowledge for but destruction and bloodshed!  A little bit of learning and you lay waste to the world!  You're no better than the Morlocks!
Last night.
Send him away.
Yes... Are you sure you want to do this?
The air... the power.
End...?
I won't leave you like this.
I should hope not...  ... Alexander... Make them read my books.  Tell them who they are. Who they could be.
As our bodies atrophied our minds... compensated.
So you take their best...
When a creature shows too much independent thought we remove them from the gene pool.  We're breeding them for submission.  Soon they will be fully domesticated.
You took her because she helped me.
Now that's what I call plain crazy -- internal combustion is just too dangerous, all those little explosions, never catch on.
I am the Fifth Avenue Public Library informational kiosk.  VOX registration NY-114.  May I help you?
I was getting to that... The moon has reached the gravitational Roche Limit, 7,300 miles above the surface of the Earth.  This has created pressure on the lunar stratum beyond gravitational tolerances.  It might be helpful to know that the nearest public evacuation shelters can be found at Grand Central Station, Madison Square Garden --
What?  Yes -- Orion -- good fortune -- sailors.
Admiration?  My my.
Your birth stone.  I thought --
Nothing -- let's just get out of the park.
The sailor's omen of good fortune. The hunter watching over him on his travels.
Do you have a romantic bone in your body?
Perseverance.
But you won't listen.  You won't see me, you won't see anyone.  What would you like me to tell Jamie? That Uncle Alex is busy?  That Uncle Alex is hiding up there in his laboratory --
I can't do that --
I can't leave when I'm so close.
I'm glad.
All right, all right -- here -- everything --
Your husband is dead?
Then you can speak slowly.
I will...
Thank you...
You can see so many here.
You share dreams?  That's incredible.
Thank you.
Yes.
What you need is an engineer.  If you set up a system of pulleys and counterweights, some basic block and tackle mechanism, you could to this a lot more easily.
I don't understand.
Learning was important?
Did you have fires at night?
I know what it is to lose someone. When my husband was taken from us... I thought the pain would never end.
I have it, but don't you think for one moment I'll be letting you go out in that filthy coat -- now go upstairs and change.  I've laid out your green coat.
Do they?
Well, I guess you'd call us... New Yorkers.
My God!  How can you just do nothing!?  They're your friends, your family.  You all knew Mara. You ate with her and worked with her... Your work in the valley, what is that for if not to --
Dean Fulton...
Yes, sir.
Should we be...
We never should have done this to him...
Depends on what you're seeing.
That wasn't a fucking restraint.
Don't act like I don't know what's real. [Beat] I'm not the one that's crazy here.
[Pointedly] Of course you're not.
I don't give a shit about your patient!
I wasn't pausing to see if you did. [Beat] But, incidentally, you should, because you're birds of a feather.
That's too bad.
You killed him?
You sure you know where to find one?
Means we believe in doing his work and fear what the world would be like if we didn't at least try to.
How...how are you here?
How?
I'm in it as we speak. [Beat] You're haunting yourself right now. [Beat] I guess sometimes we indict ourselves if no one else does. You didn't make history like you wanted to, huh, Dr. Becker. It turned out different, didn't it?
He didn't either.
Sure.
[Beat] What do you need me to do?
And I can't stay here in my condition. I am going to die tonight. It's already been decided.
No, I don't. I'm sorry. I wish I knew more.
Yeah.
What for?
No, I don't have anything to show you. I'm here from a mental hospital.
How? Did they figure it out after I died?
You think Lorenson kills you?
Maybe. I don't know. Seems more likely Becker does, but at the very least she knows how I died.
No, he didn't.
Good. How's your mom?
I'm doing fine.
I see you've done your homework. [Beat] Alpine Grove's undergone a lot of changes since then. At the time, we didn't have the...resources to help our patients the way we needed to. [Beat] Now, we do. And things are different.
So it's helping?
Well... [beat] let me know how your search turns out.
Then help me understand. You know, you're not alone. A lot of Gulf Vets have begun to experience curious symptoms. What you have might well be a syndrome and, if so, it's not one we know enough about to be treating it this vigorously.
Why not?
Don't you go to jail for that?
I tried something like 30 times. There is, as STARKS rightly figures, no suitable response to that.
I've been here for 11 years. It's my neighborhood. 'Course I'm sure. He's as drugged up as the rest of us...I guess he has to be to put up with all this.
Where are you going?
I'm going to Canada but I can let you ride with me up to the border.
You like it?
I don't know, honey.  I guess it would depend.
On what?
Honey.  Nothing's impossible.  You just don't shoot someone like that for no reason.  Maybe he was askin' for it.  Anyway, somebody's husband probably got ol' Harlan.
I gotta go to Little Rock.
You know what?  You're starting to irritate me.
Well, you're not exactly an expert witness, but what makes you so sure?
Somebody's butt is gonna bar-b-que.
The important thing is not to let on that you know anything.  We want to try and find out where they are. Now I don't want to get too personal, but do you have a good relationship with your wife?  Are you close with her?
My Lord.
Yeah, you're startin' to feel pretty good to me, too.
Darryl, that's my husband, he says he's not ready.  He's still too much of a kid himself.  He prides himself on being infantile.
Twenty-four isn't young.  I'd already been goin' out with him ten years when we got married.  I've never been with anybody but Darryl.
I'm a robber.
You're a bank robber?
God.  You're a real live outlaw!
Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies.
Louise, honey... Where are you?  You sound funny.
Can't it go to any office?
Okay.
What?
Who is it?
Maybe.
Does it have something to do with another guy?  Are you in love with him?
It's nothin' like that.
Damn, Jimmy, did you take a pill that makes you say all the right stuff?
Oh yeah.
As far as I'm concerned, yes, ma'am, you are.
No, I'm callin' from the Playboy Mansion.
Isn't this fun?
I wonder if Jimmy's gotten back.
Why don't you tell him to just to get lost once and for all?
Get the car.
Our next move?  I'll say one thing, Louise.  This is some vacation.  I sure am having a good time.  This is real fun.
If you weren't so concerned with having a good time, we wouldn't be here right now.
She thinks he's a pig.
I don't think I wanna hear what you're gonna tell me.
Okay.  Shit, Thelma!  What'd you do? I mean, what did you say?
Oooooweee!!  You shoulda seen me! Like I'd been doin' it all my life! Nobody would ever believe it.
Yes!  I believe I am!
To find out if he knows anything. If you think he does, you gotta hang up because it means the police have told him and the phone is probably tapped.
Why not?!  What's he got to lose? Other than my life's savings, that is.  Shit!
Now what what?
I guess I always thought the worst thing that could happen would be to end up old and alone in some crummy apartment with one of those little dogs.
About how fast was I going?
You do?
What?
No, Louise, you said the first part. I said all the rest.
Yes, Thelma?
No, Thelma.  I'm not gonna make any deals.
I can understand if you're thinkin' about it.  I mean, in a way, you've got something to go back for.  I mean Jimmy and everything.
You could call it that.  My eyes are open.
It would have to be pretty damn good.
We've gone insane.
Louise... no matter what happens, I'm glad I came with you.
I guess I went a little crazy, huh?
No... You've always been crazy. This is just the first chance you've had to really express yourself.
Way up ahead!
Go.
Yeah.  I been seein' you, too.
You probably even called us beavers on your CB radio, didn't you?
S'matter with you? You look like you're fading.
I guess.
...Not until I get a little something to remember you by.
Just one pair! You owe me that much, you heartless bitch!
Each day is better than the next.  Have you ever been, you know... in love with someone?
I told you, her family moved to Miami.
I also called Unsolved Mysteries.
His mother?
Huh? But why did Healy?
Uh-huh.
That sneaky prick was probably practicing his jai alai.
Don't you see? -- Healy lied to us about everything! The landlord said when he got back from Miami he kept talking about falling for some doctor named Mary!
Tell her the truth about Healy! Blow the schmuck out of the water.
I'm an orthopedic surgeon, she's an orthopedic surgeon.
Fuckin' animals. Hey, what do you say we go grab a couple drinks.
Relax, he just ate.
No I can't.
Who the fuck is it to you?
You found my car?!
Dumbshit.
Not in months. I don't even know why I bought the damn place.
By the way, what's your name?
We will, but first I have a surprise.
The architecture exhibit! My friend Tucker is going to be here. He's an architect, too. You guys will have tons to talk about.
That...? Vestibule.
Why bounce when you have your own condo in Nepal to go to?
Ouch. Come on, don't bust my chops. I know it's corny, but I do love it.
I guess.
You don't buy what?
You want her dead, don't you?
You can't be serious.
Nope. Never been.
Three different guys?
Well I'm guessing. There's a black kid, two whites, and a midget.
Ted? Don't you want the name of the housing project?
Yeah, this insurance business is too slow for me. I'm going to go down and try my hand at jai alai.
Jai alai?
Yeah, I don't know why but I always felt at home in the fronton.
It's a goddamn bunion. It'll heal.
Surprised?
What do you mean 'why'?
What?
Did you study under Kim Greene?
You heard me, goddamnit. I... I love her.
But... but you knew people at Harvard.
Bullshit!
Future wife? Get real, man -- you're nothing more than a glorified brother in her eyes.
Like I'm going to try to figure out a guy who's idea of courting is blowing farts in the chick's face
That must make it tough.
Sucks. So what's up? You some kind of salesman or something?
Two million copies it sold last year. Two million, man. But not next year -- my idea's gonna blow them outta the water. Get this:  Seven-Minute Abs.
Ugh, not pecs. Sounds like one of those guys with a fish-net shirt and a banana hammock.
No I'm not.
I don't want someone who'll put up with him. I want someone who will enjoy him, the way I do. Do you know what he told my friend Tucker? He said he would've popped the question a lot earlier if Warren wasn't in my life.  Well he is in my life and I'm goddamn lucky to have him. The hell with Steve.
I confirmed it on the scanner. I knew something was up because Puffy used to bark like hell whenever he saw him and you know Puffy only barks at bad people.
He's no Steve Young.
Come on, Magda  It's like that movie Harold and Maude.
Fuck kindred spirits. My little Puffy here's gonna tell you all you need to know about this guy in about two seconds flat. If he starts yapping, he's a loser; if Puffy's relaxed... well, you got yourself a keeper.
Don't get ahead of yourself. You'll probably need it before I will.
Ah, he was being a pest so I put him in the bathroom.
I appreciate you looking out for me.
Tucker, I appreciate you doing all this, but I'm really strapped for time here and --
Yeah, yeah. Okay, I think I know what to do. I'll call him right now.
Are you all right?
Funny story. You see, me and a buddy of mine decided to... ah... you know... just... drive down.
We'll see. If it doesn't, what the hell, at least I gave it a shot.
Why not?
Mary, come on...
You're Woogie?
Really.
Um, hi, I'm Ted Peloquin. I'm here to take Mary to the prom.
Would you shhh! Mary's gonna hear us.
I think I was very clear, Ted. If everything else falls apart, maybe.
With all due respect, Mr. Secretary, we were not firing on the ship. Firing on a ship means attacking the ship. We were not attacking the ship. We were firing over it.
And I will only issue such instructions when ordered to by the President.  John Paul Jones... you don't understand a thing, do you, Admiral?
Complete snowjob. And then we went out and told the country they weren't putting missiles into Cuba.  By the way, you realize we just lost the midterms.
I want a consensus, Bobby. Consensus. Either air strike or blockade. Something everyone'll stand by even if they don't like it. I need it by Saturday. Make it happen.
Then you'll call, right?
Yeah, but the country didn't even exist as a country yet. It was a mess, and he didn't have a leg to stand on.
We got a bunch of smart guys. We lock 'em up together in there, kick 'em in the ass til they come up with options.
We just got a second letter from Khruschev. The deal's off.
And Jack wants to trade the missiles in Turkey.
Time is of the essence.
We are not at war, sir, not until we're at DEFCON 1.
Kids are supposed to get detention.
I said his heart, not his attention.
I, uh...
What about you? Where are you going?
Today, for your information, is Pulaski Day. We're going to Buffalo...
Not as far as the election goes.
Acheson's scenario is unacceptable. And he has more experience than anyone.
Any problems, you remind them those chains of commands end at one place. Me.
If we made a trade, we'd be giving in to extortion, and NATO would never trust us again. We'll get clobbered in world opinion.
Yeah, a good political solution.
Of course it is. But the President needs to realize we're going to have to stop a ship eventually.
Why else would they approach us in this way? It's deniable. The Soviets have done nothing but lie to us. This could be more of the same.
Mr. President! We're receiving reports that the ships are stopping!
Captain, belay that order!  Bob, where's that coming from!
Will somebody find out what's going on?!
Heroes ain't supposed to shake. I'm shakin', man, look at me.
James Looks Twice?
You think I killed him? Cuz he was an apple? Well, let me tell you something about Leo, Man --
I'm a full blood Oglala Sioux, born and raised on this reservation.
You're a wise-ass. Ray check his wallet.
You crashed my file?
I've got the doer. I know who he is.
Her own people start to suspect her, it creates discord from within. The Warriors don't know who to trust, they start infighting, and Jimmy loses his support.
You weren't sent here to go off on your own detail, Ray. You were sent here to assist in a Selective Operations Unit. These regional agents are inept -- that's why they were sent out here to The Graveyard, to Indian Country. I need you behind me, Ray. Not pulling against me.
All I could think of was... not here. I don't wanna eat it on an Indian Reservation, three thousand miles from home.
-- never mind Eagle Bear. We've got Jimmy nailed. Let's go!
Bullshit.
No, this is the home of the Oglala Sioux and I want the dog-fucker who killed Leo. Whether you get him or I get him, I just want him. Shit's been goin' on too long.
Why should I tell you.
And I don't give a goddamn about whether you wear a badge or not, Crow Horse, but I didn't cut you.
We've driven a long way. Where is this place?
If you ever need a place to come back to and listen to the trees a little... we'll be here.
Go ahead, Ray.
I have a pick-up truck. No plates. Subject -- Indian -- entering suspect's house. Over.
Remember that upside down flag back at Jimmy's house? Somebody took it down.
No. No, no. Thank you.
Woh, excuse me, Sir... I see what you're saying... I've got a little Indian blood, that's true. But --  I am not an... an Indian. I can't just go in and --
No, that was Leavenworth. This --  was Sioux Falls. What ya want?
Leavenworth a tough joint?
Yes, Washington sent me, Richard. They sent me here because this whole thing has been fucked. Do you know what I mean when I say this whole thing has been fucked, Richard?
What's with you people? Why do ya have to fuck with my head all the time? I came through, man.
I get thrown in solitary until I don't know my own fuckin' name, and then you people tell me I can beat nine years if I help you. I helped you!
I blew his back out with a buffalo gun, that's how I know! Now you're gonna say I didn't, so you can throw me back in solitary?
That's a big comfort to me.
And on to a bigger one with you?
Yeow!
Two meters.
Give me a break, I'm asking you out.
Lieutenant...
The what?
How about what?
That's true. What are you?
I don't enjoy watching things suffer.
You're not, cause you eat frozen meatballs?    Things die. Every time you breathe, you kill millions of tiny organisms. Every time you eat, something had to die.
Thanks very much.  Care for some suchi?.
And now?
You ever fly an F-14? 
I want it back.
That's what I want.
I sit. I think. I play games.
It's like strip poker, only, without the bluffing.  One person says something and if the other one accepts that it's true, the one who says it, gets to take one item of clothing off.
Who's gonna win?
Hey, I never said I was a fighter pilot...I never claimed to think it was fun to be shot off the end of a ship in a storm. I can find contentment in a good book. I don't have to roar by someone at Mach two with my hair on fire. Sometimes...I just get happy being with the right man.
I live here, remember?
Right on the flight line?
Yes sir.
Yes sir!
ROGER, COUGAR.  Okay boys, pull out with your hands up and nobody'll get hurt.
It's a MiG 21. They don't have radar missiles!
What is he doing?
He better be kidding!
Wait! Hell!..Something's wrong!
Were upside down!
They must be broken. I'm hanging in my straps! We're inverted!
TELL HIM, WILL YOU TELL HIM? OUR INSTRUMENTS ARE OKAY.
NO. NO GOOD.
AND HE'S GUNNING.
What are you talking about, we gotta go!
Is it the plane?
Well what?
What do you want?
You gotta have a call sign that's just your own...never changes...you have to recognize it immediately. Then, if someone shouts "Wolf, break left!"..you react right away.
Below the hard deck doesn't count. You guys are the second team, aren't you?
On your six -- coming hard. Four hundred. Losing airspeed! He's on your six and closing fast! Hard left! HARD LEFT!
Come on, relax...
Bogey at three o'clock high! Nose on!
Time to go.
Until last night. Did you see the moves I was making on that girl at the party?
NO, NO, NO, HE'S MINE.
Tell me one thing.
Yeah, we get one of these guys every damn class.   "Maverick!"
Well, he's in trouble and he didn't even get here yet.
Helping him in.
No, really. She came ruined!... Ya think he knows it was me?
You're father was Marvin Mitchell..
Big gamble with a thirty million dollar plane!
Then why are you here?
All right.
I know. I was there.
Or you can quit.
I didn't know either. That's why I told Jester to prepare your papers.
I know a much better place down the block -- the girls are clean; the liquor ain't watered down...
You're nothing!  You're nobody!  You're a stupid dream.  Well all dreams come to an end.
Perfect!...Get out of Sector G.  Now. Don't think.  Do it.
It's about goddamn time.
Looks like another schizoid embolism.
I'm listening.
I've been artificially implanted as an emergency measure.  I'm sorry to tell you this, Mr. Quaid, but you've suffered a schizoid embolism. We can't snap you out of your fantasy. I've been sent in to try to talk you down.
What about the girl?  Brunette, athletic, sleazy and demure; just like you specified.  Is that a coincidence?
On his way.
No, Harry, I'm already late...See you tomorrow.
Come on, let's go have that drink.
Are you crazy?!  I don't know anything about Mars.
What is it?
Drive!  DRIVE!!
Anywhere!  Go!..Just go -- OH SHIT!! SHIT!!
Quit while you're ahead.
Thanks for taking Johnnycab.
Take it easy.  Tell me exactly what happened?  Why would "spies" want to kill you?
Let me finish!
Oh God, Doug.
The hell you're not.
How real does it seem?
I'm not interested in that.
Not any more.
I'm not a hooker!  That's my cover.
...Who are you?
What was I doing on Mars?!  Damn!
Damn, you know, those kids turn up oil or uranium or something out there...next thing the Feds will be at our door.  "Sorry, time to move. Eminent domain."
I don't know...  They're pretty quick...fifteen seconds?
Yeah, whatever they are, you'd think after they ate all those sheep they'd have to take a dump someplace...  What the hell's going on in town?
You're never going to believe this, but the canyon road...we were on it not two hours ago...well, it's completely...
Burt, can you hear me now?
In a minute.
VAL, STOP!  THEY'RE COMING!  DON'T MOVE!
You bet.  You gonna be staying up here?
Handymen, Earl.  We're handymen.
Don't matter.  They're all the same: dead weight.  Can't make a decision, can't walk because of their shoes, can't work because of their fingernails.  Make my skin crawl!
I thought you called it your pecker.  Look, don't make the mistake I made.  Twenty years of looking for a woman exactly like Miss October 1968, and where'd it get me?  Here with you.
Damn it, Val!  Not having a plan is what keeps us doing jobs like this!
Especially when it's two hundred feet off the ground.
So this is the guy that had your seismos working overtime?
Sure, Earl, everybody knows about them.  We just didn't tell <u>you</u>. Come on, nobody's ever seen one of these!  We're really <u>in</u> on something here!
It's been listening to us.  It's got no eyes.  It sure as hell can't smell anything underground, so I figure...
Well, it's not like we've got a hell of a lot of options...
I'm gonna help you.
Just about too damn long.  Bolt pattern's probably wrong anyway.
Jesus.  It's slower than hell.
Only if something happens to me.
It's out last one.  We can't kill them all.
Road's in!  Now, soon as we hit Bixby we start making phone calls. We could make some real money off this whole thing, get in <u>People</u> magazine...
What?
She wants to lay down.  I'm a little worried.
Yeah, Val.
Yeah, Heather, we got you.
Am I sure?!  It was right there.  There's the cord.
Okay, ten dollars.
Like <u>what</u>?!  There's nothing left that'll make it to the mountains!
And one good guy.
I don' need a hospital... I feel fine.
Correct.
Bellevue. Straight up First --
Do you see a toilet here you think is really me?
Dowd. Eddie Dowd.
Shut your sewer mouth!
Kim's prints were all over it -- He admitted it was his gun, f'r godsake!
I don't venerate drug dealers, Roger. To the contrary.
Of course.
Don't tell me where to work. I moved to New York to work for Edward Dowd. But I can't believe that Edward Dowd has nothing better to do these days than invoke exalted legal issues to get off guilty little --
-- Remember?
There's no one else to talk to. The tattoos were phony!
So an upstanding member of the Aryan Warriors wouldn't paint them on. They take those teardrops seriously -- they're badges of courage, of honor. Only their most vicious killer elite get to wear them...!
Chuckie's address. I sneaked a peek at the Rolodex.
I've got a meeting in Chinatown.
Kitty, where exactly do you place the microphone to catch the most incriminating moans?
But I like that theory. And since I'm not putting Twerp Professor on the stand, and since I don't have a better theory, I'm sticking with that theory. Meantime I want pictures of the Joes. What'll you bet there was a guy in the gang looked enough like Shu to fool the eyewitnesses!
I don't have time to read every word in every report, I'm too busy getting killed in court... Meantime my crackerjack investigator can't find the goddam art supplies store where Chuckie-fucking-Roeder works!
I killed the motherfucker.
What went down?
You can't. So tell me what you do know -- say it!
It was self-defense.
Good. Now we're going to take an affadavit from you, but only concerning the facts of the Chinatown shooting. We honestly don't give a shit about the Kennedy assassination.
Are you implying that my motives are less than sincere?
Please don't bullshit me, Mr. Reynard. You've got witness problems, you've got proof problems...
We just discovered him, your Honor! His appearance is critical to a fair presentation of our case! He is an inmate at Ossining Correctional and --
-- in a context.
So what'd this guy do? Snitch off a dealer?
That's right.
-- Roger --
And its purpose?
Fighting the Aryan Warriors and the Black Guerrillas, basically.
And what does a soldado -- a soldier -- do?
That's right.
That guy they arrested -- he was the wrong g-guy.
Yes, it's a great big psychedelic circus ride, isn't it, Cooper?
Who are you? Who are you REALLY?
Oh, yeah? You'll be callin' soon and maybe I'm not gonna be there.
I'm not... Bobby I'm gonna need some more stuff. I mean it. I'm out.
Teresa Banks had a ring. Any idea what happened to it?
My alibi is as strong as these bands of steel.
Well, where are you going?
Yep, it sure is.
No you couldn't.
Teresa Banks.
Take a look at this. Chet and I found it under Teresa Banks' ring fingernail.
No, sir, we did not.
That would indicate that it's the future.
I'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks
Code. If you work with Gordon you learn that right away.
Shorthand. Really?
Gordon said you were good. The tailored dress is our code for drugs. Did you notice what was pinned to it?
Agent Desmond, would you hold the finger for me. There's something up there.
Are you speaking to me in a code?
She's wearing a ring.
Noooo...
When?
No, and yes. I don't know what I'm going to do about Bobby. I know he is seeing someone else and that's okay with me, and he thinks I'm seeing someone else and that's not okay with him.
Because Bobby is a loser, you said so yourself. He's a goon.  James is the one.  He loves you with that "lasting love"... "true love".
I just want a friend. Just one friend for just one minute...
Yes, that's what I want. Thanks D.
This is about sex, not like.  Mom, Laura's here and I think I will have one of those huckleberry muffins.  You want a muffin?
Laura, aren't you going to fix me a drink?
Gotta go, Donna. I'll call you tomorrow.
Not you, Donna, not you.
No, you should forget about last night.
Laura, I am your friend.
I know you are and you don't have to do anything crazy to prove it.
No.
I feel so bad. I had nightmares all night long.  They all knew you at that place.
Was I wearing something of yours and you got mad at me?
All my things have me in them. I don't want you to be like me.
Cause I like it.
You got it.
Bob is real. He's been "having" me since I was 12.
James...
What's going on?
I do love you.  Let's get lost together.
What?
You want to see...
See what?
No.
Eating?
They were looking for wood.
I forgot my books at school.
Oh, honey, you don't have to lie to me. Ever. You can tell me anything. I'll understand.
Fine.
A special friend?
No, you haven't met him. Have you met him?
Guy just pulls up out of the blue... I mean... what is this world coming to?
Yes.
Stay away from me.
Look at this finger here.
There's no one here.
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
How good's your intelligence?
So what I want to do is stop it here. I'm going to make him an offer. I want to do it myself. I want it to come from me.
How did you settle on the amount?
...a Mrs. Doneghy called... I told you that.
It's a crime.
You would not...?
No.
In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that. Isn't that right?
Now. I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed...?
And wasn't that an oath...? These are your initials here: K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath. No less important than that which you took today.  Isn't that right?  Isn't that right...?
Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
Engaged to render an opinion. For a price. Is that correct? You're being paid to be here today?
Just as you are, Sir...
'Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.' Yes.
Yes, we've heard that. Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians? Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
...almost nine minutes... causing brain damage.
Say it.
I was her doctor.
Answer affirmatively. Simply. Keep those answers to three words. You weren't 'part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist. Isn't that right?
We went to Code Blue...
...to save her and to save the baby. Is that...
No. No. Thank you. You go home.
I am on the staff of...
...and you're going to do that?
What are they going to do? Not invite me to their Birthday party...?  Look, I gotta go. I have to be in Cambridge...
You live in the neighborhood?
Uh-huh. My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by.
Yes.
You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted...
Why is that?
I was held up.
Thank you for seeing me.
Mr. Concannon...?
I changed my life today. What did you do?
I changed my room at the Hotel.
Really. How wonderful for you.
We, we... No... we just had a small reversal in the case...  I have some, uh... I have some work to do...
I've got to work.
Yes.
You're talking like a drunk.
Is there going to be a later...?
You, you don't under...
Oh, yes, I do, Joe. Believe me. You say you're going to lose. Is it my fault? Listen! The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
Stop pressuring me...
Yes.  We've all got to let go.
I understand. Thank you, my name is Galvin. I'll be at the following number in a half an hour. It's urgent.
Kathy Price.
No. At Chelsea Childcare. Okay. Look, call me Monday, hey? I'm late for work.
...I'm sure you do...
But what can we do? She don't know who's visiting her...
Are we going to win?  We have, you know, other tactics, though...
...You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them...
You -- Listen: you said to me, 'if not now, when...'
No.
Mary Rooney. She won't talk to me. I tried her at the hospital. I'm going to try her back at home. Read this.
That's right.
What did she do?
We got to talk.
I don't want a mistrial.
In New York?
...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.  Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case.
Me, too.
The same thing that happened on our Pacific Coast.  Anything from them yet?
They're really for long distance. When I want to look at something close...  I take them off.
Don't you live at home?
It was...  ...one of them!
What was it like?
My kid brother has one.  You know why?
It might give us time to search out some weakness in the Martians.
All right.  I'll get them!   Go ahead - go ahead!  I'll catch up with you.
I'm here to make up a report, not to interfere with the operations you've set up.  You're still in command.  Clayton Forrester!  I haven't seen you since Oak Ridge.
And they'll go out the minute there's another ray.  A cylinder reported down by Huntington Beach.  That's a job for the Navy.
If they're more advanced than us, they should be nearer the Creator for that reason!
How would I know...!
Believe it or not, he told me I hadn't heard from him in ten years because he hasn't had any good nightmare.  They're his inspiration.  But now he's got a new script in the works.
No biggie, really.
No, you don't.
Just be careful, okay?
Forget those two clowns, Heather.  Answer me, did you get another call from that guy or not?
They are...it happened in tonight's quake.  It happened just fifteen minutes ago. You must've felt it.
Just a quick word, Ms. Langenkamp.  For Dylan's sake.
What?
They were safe and could sleep.
No, I don't think so.  You just have to...pray, or reach...
Can you come with me in my dreams?
Read me some?
Just because it's a love story doesn't mean it can't have a decapitation or two.
It's actually been giving me Freddy nightmares.
When do you think it'll be done?
Quake knocked you off your feet.  You got bumped pretty good, actually. 
Heather, it's just a movie, a dream, really...
No, not really.  I...
No time like the present.  The car will bring you.
Not yet.
Guilty.
They've become what you wanted. They're a crew.  That's why he came.
He has a lot of hurt inside him.
Weight!  Hey!  Blow the man down...
Yes, Sir.
Everybody down!  ON THE DOUBLE!!
Fifteen.
It's me, don't you see.  Terry's right, I'm the escape hatch.  I disobeyed order.
I couldn't bring her down here until I knew you were safe.
Rick March.  Who the hell are you?
Yeah.  How'd you do.
It was a bad dream...
Shut up, Phil.
Like you really care.  Like any of you give a shit what happens to me.
You weren't there, you don't know what happened.
We all have problems.
Who?
Unfurl the squares!
Face what?
He killed the dolphin.
They have every right Chuck.
Let the blow drive the boat down wind.  Neutralize our canvas.
I should be eating with the crew.
You do?
We're short one long boat too.  Come on.
Spirits have a way of bringing that out.
And being sixteen.
They're in a hurry to grow up.  They don't know about consequences or responsibility.  That's being sixteen too.  I promise you one thing...
Not a chance.  Remind them that according to the Geneva Convention, firing on a civilian vessel on the high sea is an act of war.
I can show you how to use a slide rule.
Why would you do that?
Lemme go!  Lemme go!!
I couldn't do it.
Trust me donut.  I know.
On the dog watch, night after the storm, I look down into the skylight above Skipper's cabin and there she was, peelin' down.
You've gotta be kidding?
But, they don't speak English.
No way Phil.  Not like this.
Do you think this is funny?  Some kind of joke?  You lost six people out there.
Everybody knows why she went over Tod.  You jibed the boat.
Yes, ma'am. What's on your almost- perfect mind this evening?
I'm fine, thank you. I had a cardiac infarction but I'm on a new diet and exercising regularly. I've never felt better.
I didn't hate me so much, I'd feel better wishin' you luck.
No, he's out changin' the oil in the car.
Say it!... I'LL TEAR YOUR FUCKIN' HEART OUT, GIRL... Say "fuck me" soft - then I'll leave. Say "fuck me"... Whisper it... Then I'll leave... Say it... Say it - Say it - Say it...
Thanks, Bobby, 'bout done.
No.
Come on outside, I got somethin' to show ya.
That guy Sailor came around this afternoon... Asked me if there was a contract out on 'im.
Club Zanzibar.
Real good, Chet... It's been awhile.
Everythin's relative. Where's that Marietta Pace Fortune? You two didn't split up, I hope.
No... She's fine. Back home.
It's none of my business, but when are you and Marietta gonna tie the knot? I always wondered why you never did.
That's what I mean... Always looked like you was just knocked out in love... Was real nice to see.
Woman drivin' down the street spotted me with on a roof with my rifle. She called the police and they came over and arrested me. Thought I was a sniper! Boys at the VFW loved that one. Cops didn't understand about the pigeons, the damage they do to personal property. I used to complain to the city but they never lifted a finger. I was gonna put out poison, but I was afraid somebody's cat would eat it. Hell, I had six cats myself. So I used the .22 because it didn't make much noise and the ammo was cheap.
I couldn't say, which one?
Don't talk down to me, Johnnie Farragut. I know what volition means, and that's why I want Sailor Ripley off the planet! He's pure slime and it's leakin' all over my baby. Maybe you could push him into makin' some kinda move and then kill him dead. You'd only be defendin' yourself, and with his record, nobody'd fuss.
Sailor ain't a murderer. You got to get off that kick. And far's I can tell, Sailor was entire clean prior to that involvin' Lula. Even there he was protectin' her. You oughta be thankin' him for that. That Bob Ray Lemon they say was comin' after the both of 'em. Why am I tellin' you this, you was around that night. You ought to know just exactly what happened. Sailor just got a little too forceful is all... You remember that night...
I will, Marietta. Goodbye now.
I'll meet you, Marietta, if that's what you want, but I'm against it.
I'll be damned if that wasn't a wrong number?
Somethin' was upsettin' you bad last night, and you wanted to tell me and I figured you wanted to tell me so's I could help...
Who?... Uncle Pooch?...
This 'bout the fifth time?
What I made you do, mama?
You ain't actin', mama.
Stab it and steer.
I guess I started smokin' when I was about six... My mama was already dead from lung cancer...
That's good... Now go get yourself a beer.  You fellas have alotta the same power Elvis had... Y'all know this one?
Don't the reject guys get anythin'?
At Pee Dee, all you think about is the future, you know? Gettin' out? And what you'll do and what you'll think about when you're on the outside again.
One time - real late - like about two thirty a.m.? She found Dell up in the black of night all dressed and makin' sandwiches in the kitchen.
It ain't so funny now, though. December before Christmas? Dell disappeared again and Aunt Rootie hired a private eye to find him. He was missin' for almost a month before he wandered back in the house on mornin' dressed in some filthy Santa Claus suit.
Too bad we all can't, baby... One thing about Dell?
Maybe my mama cares for me just a little too much...
You got about six more big states to go before we find out.
Come look at this.
There ain't no water in the swimmin' pool. Just a dead tree fell in, prob'ly from bein' struck by lightnin'.
You certain?
I do.
Talkin's good. Long as you got the other? I'm a big believer in talkin', case you ain't noticed.
I know. I kept walkin', I headed for your house, only it wasn't your house, really. You let me in only you weren't real pleased to see me. You kept askin', 'Why'd you come to see me now? Why now?' Like it'd been a long time since we'd seen each other.
I know you're thinkin' that I got more'n some of my mama in me? Well, I couldn't help it. Sailor, I really couldn't. I'm sorry for that guy, but when he pulled that drippin' hunk of awful-smellin' meat out of his pocket? I near barfed. And them poor diseased puppies!
Hard to tell what's shakin' in a place like this, honey. You don't want to be walkin' in the wrong door.
I want to call her and tell her I'm okay. That we're okay.
It's me who's wastin' time, Sailor, bein' with you.
You want to stick around here, Sailor? See if we can get some work?
You know, Lula, I never told you what all I was doin' before I met you.
You knew my daddy?
One bad car accident...
Don't know, but she's gonna bleed all over our car, I'll tell ya that...  Hey... Hello... Girl... You gotta come with us, honey.
Not quite as bad as the weather though... It must be a hundred and ten and it ain't even noon yet.
Maybe. Met a guy named Red, owns a garage, could have some work in about a week. Met a few hard luck boys who's stayin' here. What's that smell?
A little, I think... Darlin'?
I know. Just I'm sorta uncomfortable about the way some things is goin', and this don't help soothe me.
You talk to 'im some?...
So where'd you say you was?
Let's leave here.
He ain't never known me, Lula, so there ain't much for him to forget. Not seein' each other for six years makes it next best to simple for us, too.
In international news, India plans to release crocodiles in the Ganges, the holy Hindu river in which millions of people bathe annually, to scavenge for corpses, authorities said.
HOLY SHIT!! IT'S THE NIGHT OF THE LIVIN' FUCKIN' DEAD!!!!
Argentina! Lula, you're outta your mind. Now you just tell me where you are and I'll come for you. I won't say nothin' to the police about Sailor, I promise. He can do what he wants, I don't care.
I ain't that dumb, mama. Sailor and I been on a crime spree? Knockin' off convenience stores all across the south? Ain't you read about it?
Six.
Figure we'll go have supper someplace. Maybe get some barbecue out by Stateline. Sailor always liked that Havana Brown's Pig Pickin'.
Well, you be careful with that boy, Lula.
Mama... if you get in the way of me and Sailor's happiness, I'll fuckin' pull your arms out by the roots.
HELL NO!!! That's the last thing we need... A buncha cops runnin' around.
That's not why I called.
Yes.
What's with you? You know what take care of him means. I don't call Santos except for one big reason.
Just tell me what you want.
Yes.
In the head.
Got word the kids are moving through Texas... I think an ending is being arranged there... Come on, lemme see a smile.
Please Santos... Where's Johnnie?
So?
Hopin' you could tell me if there's a contract out on me. I really need to know.
Life is unpredictable.
Ah, right. Well, I gave you my opinion.
She's still a transvestite.
Mm.
She left me. Crabs.
And now he's addicted to painkillers.
He can't piss standing up anymore.
He heard everything we were saying.
Kidnapped? By who?
'That's my car, motherfucker.'
You did.
The last month maybe.
That's probably not the problem, then. What about your lifestyle. Any major changes recently?
So is my friend... is Sara still here?
No. There's no one here.
Relax, Vernon...
A Manhattan book editor murdering a Mormon girl's clutch.
'Fraid so.
No sweat. Only do me a favor?
Sure.
...You carry firearms.
It's not bad.
It's colder in there.
Like the lady herself.
I guess you must be, if you know the combination to his closet and he doesn't mind your being here in their bedroom like this.
Sure.
Well done, James.
The bus station.
It's my father. He gets it from his doctor.
Jesus, James. Wow.
I never heard of it.
Amazing.
Who cares what I said last night, James I -- I was drunk, I was stoned. I'd been bitten by a dog. My wife had left me. How 'bout cutting me some slack?
And don't be so goddamn sensitive. Who cares what anybody thinks anyway? You want to be a good writer? You want to be a great writer? Then stop giving a damn what other people think. Most of them haven't thought in years.
When?
The answer's yes. I think. Yes. I don't know. Where are they exactly?
James'll know about George Sanders.
Actually, He's not the Chancellor's -- What?
Who does?
I told you, Sewickly Heights.
She's left the room before. She always came back.
Is the thing -- is it over?
No. There's no way. I mean, don't you think there's no way?
Totally. I'm sorry. A lot was happening this morning. Can you talk?
Did you pass out again, Grady? Did you fall somewhere?
No. I mean. Well, actually, yes. Sort of. I don't remember. Listen, Sara, I have to tell you something.
About the baby.
It seems one of our students is -- missing and his parents found a dead dog in his bed.
Inside.
Of course, I'm sure. Ah, Christ, the puberty police are back.
He told me.
Why yes. How did you know?
James is... I don't know...
Yes?
Grady?
I have... eight-fifteen. That's not right, is it?
I... I...
Oh... yeah.
I -- just want to say I'm sorry.
Neurologist? Why? What's wrong?
You'd recognize it if you tasted it.
You want to keep him happy.
I told her all my relatives are good- looking.
Foreman now.
Five years.
Beautiful. How's business?
I'm working on it.
You're the only one in the family who still talks to me.
Carlos, I never raped a woman.
Birds.
There's a million birds here.
Their sound is quite musical.
How does it sound?
Not too far.  Are you a bird-watcher too?
My daddy likes me home before dark.
It's good to listen to your daddy.
Okay.
Yes.
Do you believe in them?
Just give me a straight answer, Walter, cause the irony goes right over my head.
Yeah.
Lovers' quarrel?
Can I ask how old you are?
No thank you.
Do you want me to sit on your lap?
Ms. Kramer.
Yes you can, Robin.
I'd like you to keep a journal.
That's right.
By reflection we can derive a deeper meaning from our experience in life. We gain greater understanding about ourselves that can lead to making better choices in our relationships, our careers, and our goals.
Is it just my cheery personality that makes your skin itch?
Rosen? I don't have a problem with that.
Because if you did, I know a therapist named Ryan. I also know a therapist named Chung.
I don't need someone else.
I'm not that crazy.
You couldn't say.
I suppose it's however society defines it.
I don't know!
I want you to calm down.
Sorry.
Okay. Eyes closed, mind a blank. I'm all yours. Do it, Rosen.
No. When I say the word "pretty," when I say the word "pleasure," what is the earliest memory you see?
In my bedroom, sleeping.
But roughly, how old?
I don't like nobody behind my back!
I'm all right.
Most women wouldn't choose it.
What?
I go backpacking a lot. Lose myself in the wilderness for a week or two.
So... what's your dark secret?
Of course. Sorry. I'm such a fucking asshole.
Don't tell me I'm not a fucking asshole when I know I'm a fucking asshole!
Because I like you.
Walter.
Don't be sorry for me. I did those things. No one else did. I'm dealing with that.
I know.
All three -- in chronological order.
Most people don't have my kind of problems.
What's it look like?
Why's it always my fucking problem?
Fucking liar.
Where're you?
It was alright for a while, you know.  But then she got promoted to project engineer on this thing, couple years ago.
What is that?  You drop your dive light?
Folks, I've just been told to shut down the hole and prepare to move the rig.
I... they're all dead, Bud.  They're all dead. I thought... some of them... you know...
Yeah, okay.  Okay.
You wimp.  I had a lot riding on this.  They bought you... more like least rented you cheap--
Wow, you're right!  Us poor dumb ol' boys might've had to think for ourselves.  Coulda been a disaster.
That must be it.
I don't know.  Divorce ain't final.  Forgot to take it off.
You're right, Bud.  It was just that simple. Aren't you clever?  You should get your own show... Ask Dr. Bud, advice to the lovelorn from three hundred fathoms.
I don't know what I saw.  Okay?  Coffey wants to call it a Russian submersible, fine.  It's a Russian submersible.  No problem.
Whose then?  Lindsey?  Talk to me...
Yeah.  So sue me.
How?
Don't argue, goddamnit, just--
Okay... Hippy's not going... McWhirter, you can run Little Geek.
Let's go, guys.
Meet me in the moonpool.  Move fast.
Oh... chamber runs.  Uh huh, that's good.  Well, hey... you guys know any songs?
Neutron counter's not showing very much.
Gimme a break!  Coffey, these things live three and a half miles down on the bottom of an abyssal trench!  Trust me... they're not speaking Russian.
You don't need to know the details of this mission... you're better off if you don't.
Gotcha, Cab Three.  Who is that?  That You, Lindsey?
I gotta tell you, that guy scares me a lot more than whatever's down there.  A.J. Squared Away goddamn jarhead robot.  Okay, gimme a couple hours on this.
What kind of luminous things, Bud?
Perry, stand by on the ROV.  Sorry about this, little buddy.  Better you than me, know what I mean?
Very good.  About one person in twenty just can't handle it.  They go buggo.  They're no way to predict who's susceptible, so stay alert.
I don't know... It depends on Ettore... He's now in the process of negotiating for a contract here in Sicily...
Wait for what?
In this case, getting married means nothing. Aren't we already the same as being married? And Corrado and Giulia -- aren't they already the same as being married?
I mean, to stay away longer -- two months... a year... three years... Yes, I know, it sounds absurd. And I feel awful. The very idea of losing you makes me want to die... And yet... I... I just don't have the same feeling for you any more.
If I had a man waiting for me for half an hour and whom I hadn't seen for a month ...
Yes, fairly well. But I went to bed last night planning to do some thinking about a number of things ... instead, I fell asleep.
Then why don't you try it on?
Without any doubt, sir. If anything belonging to the girl who has run away is still here on this island...
That must be Basiluzzo.
At the ruins. They're very ancient, you know.
Then why don't we go up and see the ruins?
That seems to apply to you also...
I know. I keep asking myself what I could have done to prevent all this from happening.
I'm sorry. I didn't want to sound cynical. But isn't it better to look things squarely in the eye?
No, I'm sure it won't. Move over there. Let's make believe nothing happened. And when we get to the next station, get off.
No, Sandro, please... I ask you as a favor...
But why, Claudia?... Why?
Because what I'm doing is so ugly ... Because if you told me right now: "Claudia, I love you," I would believe you...
And are you sure you want to marry me? Are you really sure...that you want to marry... me?
As soon as you're ready, you can come down and catch up with me. I'll be waiting for you right outside on the square.
So, you wonder why?
No reason why...
Yes, she started to but I didn't feel like staying to listen to what she had to say. If we had to listen to everybody...
Aren't you going to change?
I just can't leave without first searching those islands, one by one.
You say that just to flatter me.
Do you consider that a compliment?
No.
I imagine he must be inside sleeping.
More or less, we are all afraid. Especially at night.
Please, do come... Don't leave me alone with him. He's capable of... I don't know... Have you noticed his eyes?
And you expect to find him in here? Go and ask Claudia.
You men are all so dreadful!
But how could they pose like that? I couldn't.
But why me?... Ask Claudia, she's much more beautiful than me.
So that's why you've turned to smuggling, eh? You need the money. Now, I can help you. I can see that you get some assistance from the government. But first there's a little formality we've got to take care of. Just a few questions and then we can all go to lunch... Your friend tells me you dropped anchor three times...
Yes, she takes care of the garden.
Look, Marshal, with those deep crevasses, you'll need some rope and ladders...
I know, I know. One thing at a time.
I detest it. But, after all, what can you do... It's the latest...and I try my best to adapt myself.
Wait a moment. Can't you see I'm busy?
Oh... I'm sorry I have to rush but I've got to write a story about this thing that just happened... Tell me exactly how it all turned out.
He talked to you Himself?
No.
Because...
He loves you the way you are.
It's a sin to be fat.
That's not what he meant.
Oh my dear child.
Who?
I'm not hungry.
No I don't... the host is enough.
In the medieval days the nuns and monks would sleep in their own coffins.
That was the beginning, the night of the conception. That's why she burnt the sheets.
Anything... may I sit down?
Yes.
Love.
Yes.
Right now?
Yes.
Oh, yes!
And you like that?
Oh, yes.
Did it hurt?
Where?
From their heads...
From God.
I don't understand what you're talking about... you want to talk about the baby... everybody wants to talk about the baby but... I never saw the baby so I can't talk about the baby because... I don't believe in the baby.
Are you married?
Why do you smoke?
No, only when she felt like it. She brought me up here last winter and the next day she died.
No wonder... wait... Agnes... Agnes how do you feel about babies?
Oh, they frighten me, I'm afraid I'll drop them. They have a soft spot on their heads and if you drop them so they land on their heads they become stupid. I was dropped on my head, that's why I don't understand things.
Oh, no place as wonderful as this. Agnes... have you ever thought of leaving the convent for something else?
No. There is nothing else. Just being here at night helps me sleep.
Agnes...
I could never be a mother.
A mistake... it was a mistake...
... that you don't remember getting pregnant...
Not my fault.
I'm always bad.
... makes me...
Yes?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes I am.
I had a baby.
It came out of me.
Because I was afraid.
May I open my eyes now?
I can't tell you that.
She made me promise not to.
Oh don't be, I'm here. It's alright. I want you to tell me what you did before you went to bed.
Hm hmm. What did you have for dinner?
Fish...  ... brussel sprouts.
Someone's following me.
Are you ill?
What do you feel?
Go away, I don't want you here.
What did she mean?
Yes.
He frightened you and he hurt you. It's not your fault. It's his fault. Tell us who he is so we can find him. Stop him from doing this to other women.
It was alive wasn't it?
And then... what did she do?  Agnes what did she do?
Something they... that they overlooked.
You got to be crazy.
If I find anything I'll call you.
I'll have it.
Shut up, I'm trying to watch this.
How did she hide it from the other nuns?
Obviously there was.
Look, someone gave her the baby.
And I am not from the Middle Ages. I know what you are!  I don't want that mind cut open.
From other people!  I believe she is not crazy, nor is she lying.
If she's so innocent, how come she murdered a child?
About two years before.
I hate ignorance and stupidity.
... or bullied or what ever you're doing. Who the hell do you think you are?  You go around here expecting applause for the way you treated this child.
I am not a virgin, Doctor. I was married for twenty three years, two daughters. I even have grandchildren... surprised? It might please you to know that I was a failure as a wife and mother. My children won't even see me any more, that's their revenge. I think they tell their friends that I've passed on. And don't tell me I'm making up for past mistakes Doctor Freud. 
I am...
And Agnes' father?
I don't think I care to know.
Oh, God.
Who said anything about the Catholic Church...
And what has that to do with it?
So you left the Church because you had freckles?
All right?
Fine thanks...
Oh, you've come a long way baby.
Then let's begin.
But she is not an enigma Mother. Everything that Agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry. One, two, three, right down the line.
Where is she?
I have a few more questions to ask her.
My God, but you're determined.
Why do you insist upon pressing...
Too late for what?
She didn't want any help.
Before or after you killed the child?
Agnes, what happened to the baby?
She can't remember.
The usual ten per cent?
How fascinating. Do go on ...  ... John.
Yeah, I've blown school out.
Oh, it's all right.
Oh.
Aren't you supposed to be in that box?
Oh, surely one can have a tiny touch.
Ah ... a shamus, eh?
Well, remember, its Leathery Magee up ahead in that convertible, so cover me in the stake-out.
You've got an inferiority complex, you have.
Do I snore?
I'll have a bash.
Good. Hart, get him whatever it is they drink, a cokearama?
I beg your pardon?
No, straight up.
I suggest you just give him the photos and have done with it.
Well, let's broaden our outlook.
Yes, you're quite a feather in the cap.  Hello, I've got one ... oh, I think so ... yes, he can talk ... Well ... I think you ought to see him.  Of course, right away.
Oh aye, but I thought ...
Go away! You've spoilt it.
Oh, sorry I spoke.
What's that mean?
Well, the way you were spouting, like ....  "I don't believe you, sir..." and all that. Yeah, it was gear.
We do, you know. We sound like us having a ball. It's fab.
Is she?
Aye, it is but as long as you get by, it's all right, you know ... bash on, happy valley's when they let you stop. Anyroad, I'd better get back.
Yeah ... that's right.
Eh?
What's he on about?
Why do you always use your left hand?
That little old man.
He's got you worried, then?
Shurrup! Look, Mister, we've paid for our seats too, you know.
Shall I?
Like what?
Y'what?
Sit down, the lot of you.
What?
No, not me.
No, I'm not.
I'm not, no.
Oh you do, look.
I would have said so.
It's all over the place, everyone knows.
Aah, shurrup, misery!
Y'what?
Don't exaggerate.
No, we're not!
Sorry.
Someone put it on me.
But...
Oh, all right. Come here, Grandad.
I know, that's the trouble.
Well ... if he's your Grandfather, who knows?
You were twanging too loud.
Oh, anything you say, Paul.
Hell, no!  We don't know what's down there on that piece of rock!  It might be dangerous!  What we should do is get on the radio to the exploration authorities... and let them deal with it.
Well, line of sight is impossible due to dust.  Radar gives me noise. Sonar gives me noise.  Infrared -- noise.  Let's try ultraviolet.  There. Flat.  It's totally flat.  A plain.
Is it solid?
Receiving.
Don't remember nothing.  Can't hardly remember my name.
I have intercepted a transmission of unknown origin.
A transmission?
I am programmed to do so if certain conditions arise.
It is none of the 678 dialects spoken by technological man.
I have a temporary sequence on the monitor --
Has the hull been breached?
What do you mean?
Dead.
Damn it!  How long to fix?
What?
Just hold us together till we're in space, that's all!
You can't tell -- that kind of stuff could represent printed circuits...
Ask him.
Careful, don't get under it!
Still unconscious?
Yes.
The only other thing I can think of is for somebody to crawl in there and flush it out.
Thing is, I'm about out of fuel.
<u>How</u>?
No... the risk is too great.  Perhaps after we've destroyed the thing.
But they don't know about the translation!  They could be in danger right now.
Three blips!  They're coming this way!
Oh... God...
I think it's fizzled out.
Hey!  what about the film?
It was horrible -- horrible.  Like a chicken.
In symbolic form... very stylized... but if you stare at it, you can see some of the different creatures we've been dealing with.
It's not going to work.
If you press the button right now, it will blow the whole nose of the ship off.
Sorry.  Nothing but that same damn transmission, every 32 seconds.  I've tried every frequency on the spectrum.
We can't even radio for help; the carrier wave wouldn't reach its destination till long after we'd died and turned to dust.  We are utterly, absolutely alone.  Can anybody really visualize such a scale of distances?  Halfway across Creation...
Let's get moving with this net.
Close...
Sandy, contact traffic control.
Computer, you have signalled a priority three message.  What is the message?
Sandy... how far are we from the source of the transmission?
Not a one.  It's dead.
Still worried?
Look, I'm not trying to rub anybody's nose in anything.  The important thing is just to get away from here as fast as possible.
I can't lean on Faust any harder -- he's been working non-stop on the engines.
Let's take her into an escape orbit.
You bet we made it.  Martin, set course for Irth and accelerate us into stardrive.
Go ahead, Jay.
The man would need protection, obviously -- as well as some way to drive the thing before him.
What's that supposed to mean?
At least we're rid of the damn monster.  It must have been the first thing sucked out of the ship.
Doesn't matter -- we're already at light speed.  And when we get back to the Colonies, they'll pick us up in the network.
Yeah... I forgot.
Look...
No... don't...
But I can save you -- get you to the Autodoc!
Yep...
And?
About thirty minutes.  Those are slimmed-down tanks, so no stopping to admire the scenery.
We've dumped the whole data-base from one of the cleaning remotes into the helmet. It'll project the route through the sewer system onto the inside of the glass as you go.
But...
Ah, quit griping.  Keeps you in shape doesn't it?
What?
One final point.  Killing this sonuvabitch ought to be a reward in itself.  However, just to add a little incentive... I'm authorizing a hefty bonus in the next pay-packet for whoever does.
And, nothing.  They checked out just fine.
No, not really.  More sort of the  'claustrophobic' type.
Phoebe.
Phoebe?
Why not? Tell me, Phoebe, do you want some day to have an award like that of your own?
It's not modesty. I just don't try to kid myself.
I think the time has come for you to shed some of your humility. It is just as false not to blow your horn at all as it is to blow it too loudly...
I am somebody.
I'm not enough for a paragraph.
I'm not surprised. After all that humble pie...
Heart to heart? Woman to woman? Including a casual reference to the part of "Cora" - and your hopes of playing it.
I discussed it very openly. I told her that I had spoken to Lloyd - and that he was interested.
Do you know, Eve - sometimes I think you keep things from me.
Are you that sure of tomorrow?
Max is paying for it. He and Lloyd had a terrific row but Lloyd insisted... well. Can I fix you a drink?
Lloyd and I.
Well, say something - anything! Congratulations, skol - good work, Eve!
What do you mean by that?
I can't believe my ears...
So does the history of the world for the past twenty years. I don't enjoy putting it as bluntly as this, frankly I had hoped that you would, somehow, have known - have taken it for granted that you and I...
Then if you won't get out, I'll have you thrown out.
She never proved anything, not a thing!
Because I don't want to.
No, it's not.  It's for this.
You're being childish.
That's all television is, my dear. Nothing but auditions.
Over? It can't be. I've come to read with her. I promised Max.
Frankly, I don't remember.
Just slipped your mind.
I take it she read well.
It wasn't reading, it was a performance. Brilliant, vivid, something made of music and fire...
To the best of my recollection, neither your name nor your performance entered the conversation.
The air lines have clocks, even if you haven't! I start shooting a week from Monday - Zanuck is impatient, he wants me, he needs me!
Thank you so much.
I leave in a week - the picture's all wrapped up, we previewed last night... those previews. Like opening out of town, but terrifying. There's nothing you can do, you're trapped, you're in a tin can-
Bill, you know how much I do - but over the phone, now really, that's kid stuff...
She hasn't missed a week since I left - but you know all that, you probably tell her what to write... anyway, I sent her a list of people to ask - check with her.
How is Eve? Okay?
To put me to bed? Take my clothes off, hold my head, tuck me in, turn off the lights, tiptoe out...? eve would. Wouldn't you, Eve?
You've heard it. About when I looked through the wrong end of a camera finder.
Clyde Fitch, thought you may not think so, was well before my time!
Twenty minutes!
Then without feeling, your guests were also wondering whether the music couldn't be a shade more on the - shall we say, happier side?
What's all over?
The audition.
I must have frightened her away.
Don't calm down.
Well, you needn't. I will not be tolerated. And I will not be plotted against!
Now don't get carried away-
- shows up for an audition when everyone knew I'd be here... and gives a performance! Out of nowhere - gives a performance!
Don't be condescending.
It's not nonsense.
I wish it were.
Why what?
The Theatuh, the Theatuh-  - what book of rules says the Theater exists only within some ugly buildings crowded into one square mile of New York City? Or London, Paris or Vienna?  Listen, junior. And learn. Want to know what the Theater is? A flea circus. Also opera. Also rodeos, carnivals, ballets, Indian tribal dances, Punch and Judy, a one-man band - all Theater. Wherever there's magic and make-believe and an audience - there's Theater. Donald Duck, Ibsen, and The Lone Ranger, Sarah Bernhardt, Poodles Hanneford, Lunt and Fontanne, Betty Grable, Rex and Wild, and Eleanora Duse. You don't understand them all, you don't like them all, why should you? The Theater's for everybody - you included, but not exclusively - so don't approve or disapprove. It may not be your Theater, but it's Theater of somebody, somewhere.
So am I.
When I told you what every young actress should know.
A diamond collar, gold sleeves - you know, picture people...
You don't have to apologize for me!  I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings. It's just my way of talkin'...
When we get home you're going to get into one of those girdles and act for two and half hours.
No.
She works hard.
How do you mean that?
Miss Harrington...
I've heard of them.
Subway.
I've seen you so often - it took every bit of courage I could raise-
Bill Sampson? He's - he's a director.
Standing room doesn't cost much. I manage.
You look just fine...  ... by the way. What's your name?
Don't worry too much about that. Margo just doesn't miss performances. If she can walk, crawl or roll - she plays.
I seem to be forever thanking you for something, don't I?
No! I don't expect you to believe anything. Except that the responsibility is mine. And the disgrace.
I'm not crying.
Some vague promises of a test, that's all - if a particular part should come along, one of those things-
I'll never get over it.
Yes, you will. You Theater people always do. Nothing is forever in the Theater. Love or hate, success or failure - whatever it is, it's here, it flares up and burns hot - and then it's gone.
After all you've said... don't you know the part was written for Margo?
I won't be a minute.
I could watch you play that last scene a thousand times and cry every time-
Well, teacher's away and actors will be actors...
Well, you've done so much... what's new?
No trouble at all.
It seems I can't think of a thing you haven't thought of...
I had no idea you knew each other.
What a pity, all that fire and music being turned off...
Hi.  "Well, now Mis' Channin', ah don't think you can rightly say we lost the wah, we was mo' stahved out, you might say - an' that's what ah don' unnerstand about all these plays about love-stahved Suth'n women - love is one thing we was nevah stahved for the South!"
They're your fans, your audience-
I'm so sorry... Harrington. Won't you sit down?
I was telling Margo and Lloyd about how often you'd seen the play...
How far to the station?
I just never think of Lloyd as anywhere but indoors and anything but sitting down.
Those years stretch as the years go on. I've seen it happen too often.
Not to you. Not to Bill.
Silly, isn't it? You'd think they'd fix it so people could just sit in a car and keep warm...
Well...
Let's not fumble for excuses, not here and now with my hair down. At best, let's say I've been oversensitive to... well, to the fact that she's so young - so feminine and helpless. To so many things I want to be for Bill... funny business, a woman's career. The things you drop on your way up the ladder, so you can move faster. You forget you'll need them again when you go back to being a woman. That's one career all females have in common - whether we like it or not - being a woman. Sooner or later we've all got to work at it, no matter what other careers we've had or wanted... and, in the last analysis, nothing is any good unless you can look up just before dinner or turns around in bed - and there he is. Without that, you're not woman. You're something with a French provincial office or a book full of clippings - but you're not a woman...  ... slow curtain. The end.
Lloyd says it's a publicity release...
Check.
You'll be there, won't you.
It's just possible she didn't...
- don't run out of adjectives, dear.
That's quite a change of subject.
No, I got the idea myself - while she was talking to me...
Now just a minute-
You - for one. I told her you were set on Margo playing the part - and I certainly wouldn't make a change without your approval.
Margo!
What are you going to wear?
Not much.
Did Miss Harrington tell you to call Mr. Richards?
That was way back...
Within your time, buster. Lloyd, honey, be a playwright with guts. Write me one about a nice, normal woman who shoots her husband.
When you do, let me in on it.
I will.
Twentyish. It isn't important.
How do you mean?
Just one person. Isn't that so?  You know what this is all about, don't you? It has very little to do with whether you should play "Cora" - it has everything to do with the fact that you've had another fight with Bill.
I thought you knew... She was put on over a week ago-
The audience will want its money refunded, believe me.
You know, she probably means well, after all...
My dear Horowitz. In the first place, I'm paying you union scale. Second, it's my piano. Third, if everybody doesn't like kind of dying on the vine, they can get off the vine and go home. "Liebestraum."
Poor Max. Heartburn?  It's that Miss Caswell. I don't know why she doesn't give Addison heartburn.
Miss Caswell?  What?
Would you?
Margo, I wouldn't think of taking that girl away from you...
--what have you been here, nine months?--I been in this business since I was sixteen--
--and you've had some fucking meteoric rise, that's for sure--by the time you turn forty you might be the head of the Montana bureau--
About the past year.
--see?--
Facts or theory?
Anything you've got.
And I'm a Republican.
Then tomorrow's grand jury indictments will just be bullshit.
You mean, who's going to play the mean M.P. and who's going to be the nice one?  Whichever.
Nothing--I just found out that Jeb Magruder from CREEP is a bigger bike freak than I am.  I never like it when the other guy's human...
--shit, who do we know?--
Now the reason no one believed the Republicans is because there wasn't any reason, they were so far ahead. But Segretti was talking to these other lawyers a year before the break- in.
So maybe Watergate wasn't really about Watergate--maybe that was just a piece--
--because a year before, the Republicans weren't ahead, not in the polls, Muskie was running ahead of Nixon then. Before he self- destructed.
Segovia begged me for me secret but I said, "No, Andres, you'll have to try and make it without me."
Could have won him a fraternity paddle with a White House seal.  God knows it worked.
What was the mistake? Do you think it's been rigged, all along the way, leading us on so they could slip it to us when it mattered? They couldn't have set us up better; after all these months our credibility's gone, you know what that means?
The telephone calls... we know about that.
--Teddy Kennedy?
I'd really like to see Mr. Dardis.
I called him from Washington. He's the one who asked me to be here at eleven in the morning.
Well of course.
Tell that to Muskie.
Sure--off the record.
--it makes the break-in real--it's a major goddamn story--  --I'm not going to kick ass over this, but I'd like you to know I hate getting beat, I just hate it-- don't forget that I hate it--
--what about you?--
I think.
--you don't really think you're being followed?
I never worked for Sloan or Stans.
It's obvious you want to talk to someone--well, I'm someone.
There were a group of them--I think five, I don't know their names.
Because people at the Committee were told to lie to the prosecutors?
Kalmbach--Nixon's personal lawyer.
We're moving.  I've been looking for a job but it's been... hard. My name's been in the papers too much. Sometimes I wonder if reporters understand how much pain they can inflict in just one sentence. I'm not thinking of myself. But my wife, my parents, it's been very rough on them.
I'm not your source on that.
OK.
She's an awfully good reporter--I can't remember her getting too much wrong before, can you?
--I've completely forgotten where it was, except I know it wasn't her apartment.
--melodramatic?  Things are past that--remember, these are men with switchblade mentalities who run the world as if it were Dodge City.
I know what it means--Segretti wouldn't go on the record, but if he would, we know he'd implicate Chapin. And that would put us inside the White House.
Who?--be specific. How high up?
Of course--my God, you think something this big just happens? The break-in and the cover up, of course Mitchell knew, but no more than Ehrlichman.
Where?
Government. Recently retired.
Nobody ever had too much.
--absolutely--and that's all they do, sit sit sit--every once in a while, they call up a Senator, some reporting--
Mr. John Mitchell, the head of CREEP, says it means nothing.  "...This man and the other people involved were not operating on either our behalf or with our consent. These is no place in our campaign or in the electoral process for this type of activity, and we will not forget it or condone it."
Just that on his office wall there's a cartoon with a caption reading, "When you've got them by the balls, their hearts and minds will follow."
Let me see what you get, but don't jump--The New York Times thinks it's crazy Cubans.
Howard--
I know, I did, but damnit Howard--  For the first time since I've known him, I think he's really humping...
I don't know, but I don't think that's unreasonable either, do you?
A girl. Melissa.
No, I'm a reporter. I wanted to talk to you about the Committee to Re- Elect.
Finch, you can be the one to date a nearly-dead insane chick.  Eat your damn imitation hot dog.
Mochaccino.  Actually, in the spirit of the pact, I do need to ask for your cooperation in one small matter.
I believe the kegs are upstairs.
Yes ma'am, I am.
Yep.
No idea.
I mean it really bothers me when people try to pigeonhole me like that.
What?  No I'm not.
That's nice.
...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy.
This isn't any better, Chris.
Then don't.
Of course he does.  What about you? Have you just never had one with Kevin -- or have you never had one, period?
Are you kidding?  You've never double- clicked your mouse?
Sure.
Well...I'm pretty sure I've --
Well, if you want to get her in the sack, tell her you love her.  That's how I was duped.
Well it's up to you.  The Big L, or the Big O.
Pontificated.
Their tiger-style kung-fu is strong; but our dragon style will defeat it!
Exactly three weeks to the day.
Went home to shit.
Shut up.  You're supposed to be supportive.
Jesus, Kevin, rub it in.
My date's a flute-toting band dork. That answer your question?
Yeah.
Okay, well that about covers it.
What was your name again?
What, you think I don't know how to get myself off?  Hell, that's what half of band camp is!  Sex ed!
Don't you want me to?
Yeah -- hey, did you see The Little Mermaid on TV the other night?  That Ariel, whew.
Apple pie...  McDonald's or homemade?
Oh that's really reassuring.  And don't call me Nova anymore.  I'm a fraud.
Yeah, I think you sounded pretty good.
Did you see that Central chick? Brunette?
Yes, slowly.
No!  I've got...reserve reserves!
So have I.  And I know you want to make things perfect for me.  And I understand that you really wouldn't tell me that until you were 100% comfortable with it.
No...I know the perfect time...
Yeah, are you?
Yeah.  Are you sure?
Don't say that, we can do it somehow. It might not be perfect, but --
What?  Not <u>the</u> Bible?
I'm such a loser.
That's the spirit.
Dude, it's gotta happen -- she's a college chick!
What the fuck are you doing here?
What a coincidence, I am someone!  Mmm. Calvin Klein's Obsession. Now it's mine too.
It's nothing. A stupid party. Not really a night club, it's, uh...
Like an underground club?
In an underground club? I'd like to see that.
Maybe I didn't know him like you did. But he's my uncle. And I owe it to him to get some answers. It's a quest like, uh, Hemingway, the Old Man and The Sea. Except instead of an old man I'm a young man, and instead of the sea, it's a bunch of tunnels under Paris. And instead of a big fish it's... who knows? That's what I'm going to find out. Au revoir.
Andy!
Okay. But I'm back in half an hour.
That's what counts. If you're not passionate about it, don't waste your time. That's why I quit college... Plus I'm a lazy bastard.  Wait, I know this... A votre sante.
I didn't know he had a wine cellar.
You know what. Kill me. Cut out my fucking heart. Go on! Do it!
"Stop! Beyond this passage lie the catacombs of Paris: the exclusive domain of the dead."
Before the coma!
Yeah, okay. Just gimme a minute to freshen up.
You sure it's not just 'coz you jerk off too much?
Andy? Andy is that you?
Yeah, I finally "checked out", thank God. But there's a bit of unfinished business.
Not that I know.
What are you so damn angry about? Did somebody turn into a wild beast and rip your intestines out? Huh?
Don't worry. In a few seconds you won't feel a thing.
Allo?
Serafine? Is that you? What's going on?
Claude, it's Andy, he's acting really weird, I think something happened last night...
Now!
He says -
You think that's what McDermott was raving about in the ambulance?
But what if we can't ever find where we came from?!
You must have.
Poor Meetoo!
Cut it out, Vlad! I'm not angry with you anymore - I know how much you needed the money.
You know, it's strange - Anastasia's grandmother, the Dowager Empress Tatiana has been looking for Anastasia since the revolution.  Why do you think she wouldn't go to her own grandmother?
I have my reasons.
Trying... to... breathe...
Natasha! Natasha Feastavich!- but we called her Nashie Fooshie!
Lost. it feels lost. This was hers?
Don't be
I'll never let go!
Is it? Is this what you want?
Why would I ever be angry with you, little friend?
Okay... you're not gonna like this but, well, it looks like Anastasia is ... still alive.
I cursed then all!
She leads a charmed life, that little one ... Someone is always there to save her. In the palace as a child, on the train and now ... it's him.
That was your dinner!  I do hope there is no cabbage in Paris!
Pray he's color-blind...
But it's not	the money, Vlad.
Rasputin!
STOP IT! I DID SO KILL THEM! And I'm going to kill Anastasia.
What I <U>found</U>your was your granddaughter!
That last night in the palace... one boy showed us kindness and courage. You were the boy who saved our lives, weren't you?  Please, is there nothing I can do to repay you?
Oh, Dmitri.I wish that I could.
This is Alvy Singer!
Will you relax, please? They're gonna love you, I know.
Hey, can we not stand here and argue in front of everybody, 'cause I get embarrassed.
H'h, that's a polite word for what you are.
Well, stop listening to him.
M'm, I don't know, sometimes I ask myself how I'd stand up under torture.
That movie makes me feel guilty.
It's always some kind of an excuse. It's- You know, you used to think that I was very sexy. What... When we first started going out, we had sex constantly... We're-we're probably listed in the Guinness Book of World Records.
You know, I-I think... if I could pry this door off... We shoulda gotten steaks 'cause they don't have legs. They don't run around.
Oh, well, I'm goin' uptown, too.
I mean, I can go uptown, too. I live uptown, but... uh, what the hell, I mean, it'd be nice having company, you know I mean, I hate driving alone.
Well... thank you again.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Okay.
M'hm...
Oh, sorry.
Oh... oh, well, you see now now, uh, that's my dad, that's Father-and that's my... brother, Duane.
Fifteen years, huh?
Well, uh...  You're what Grammy Hall would call a real Jew.
And we'll digest our food better.
That's, uh...  that's pretty serious stuff there.
Yeah?
Oh, yeah.
And there's the winner of the Truman Capote look-alike contest.
I know you've only known me a short while.
Well, I mean, I'm moving in with you, that's why.
It's different 'cause you keep your own apartment.  Because you know it's there, we don't have to go to it, we don't have to deal with it, but it's like a-a-a free-floating life raft... that we know that we're not married.
You don't think I'm smart enough to be serious about.
Well, I'll give you a shot of sodium pentothal. You can sleep through it.
Is it my imagination or are you just going through the motions?
No, I don't think so. No, I don't think they're gonna hate you at all. On the contrary, I think-
It's Easter. You know, we'll have a nice dinner, we'll sit down and eat. I think they're gonna really like you.
You followed me!
Paranoid? I'm looking at you. You got your arms around another guy.
Oh, stop it. But you were having an affair with your college professor. That jerk that teaches that incredible crap course "Contemporary Crisis in Western Man"!
Oh, well, now we're finally getting to a subject you know something about!
Oh, yeah? How'd it go?
Tsch. Rea- All this happened in the first hour?
and I keep, you know, it's-
Well, well, sure... because he's a singer and you're a singer, you know, so it's perfect. So you're trying to suffocate yourself. It-it makes perfect sense. Uh, uh, that's a perfect analytic... kind of insight.
She said, your name was Alvy Singer.
No, I didn't.  I said, "Will it change my life," Alvy.
And what are you doing following me around for, anyway?
I just think we oughta call this relationship quits!
That's what you got me here for at three o'clock in the morning, 'cause there's a spider in the bathroom?
I can't sleep with a live thing crawling around in the bathroom.
I know, I know, and a first-aid kit and a fire extinguisher.
Alvy, you're a little hostile, you know that? Not only that, you look thin and tired.
Oh, I-I left it at your house.
snow shovel or anything or something.
Honey, there's a spider in your bathroom the size of a Buick.
Yeah?
Hey, can yuh watch the road? Watch the --
Holy cow!
What is this? Is this a... Present?  Are you kidding?
Yeah, hey, why don't yuh try it on?
I mean... I tried everything, you know, I-I-I put on soft music and my- my red light bulb, and...
Yeah, and gradually you get old and die. You know it's important to make a little effort once in a while.
Well, let's see now... If it has my name on it, then I guess it's mine.
Why? You wanna live out here all year? It's like living in Munchkin Land.
That's right, that's right.  You only gave me books with the word "death" in the titles.
Can I confess something?
Alvy, what is so fascinating about a group of pituitary cases trying to stuff the ball through a hoop?
What's fascinating is that it's physical. You know, it's one thing about intellectuals, they prove that you can be absolutely brilliant and have no idea what's going on. But on the other hand...  the body doesn't lie, as-as we now know.
Oswald and ghosts.
I'm a Rosicrucian myself.
Yeah.
Oh, tsch, thank you. H'm.
What are you depressed about?
Yes.
Stop calling me Max.
But the- I'm not discussing politics or economics. This is foreskin.
There's no economic crime, you know, but there's-there's ritual, religious- cult murders, you know, there's wheat- germ killers out here.
Max, I've got a hit series.
Yeah, well, that's why this machine is dynamite.
You wanna lie down?
M'hm.
SO?
Oh, I can imagine. P-p-probably the wife of an astronaut.
I have to face facts. I-I adore Alvy, but our relationship doesn't seem to work anymore.
If only I had the nerve to break up, but it would really hurt him.
Well, hi!
Uh, well, I'd like to talk to you about that sometime, if you get a chance.
No, I don't-I don't know, but I-I know your work. I'm a big fan of yours.
Oh.
I don't know. I don't know.
Yeah.
I'm not that good.
And you've only just met.
Oh, she's really enjoying it.  I think. Is Mac okay?
What?
Well, I can't make any promises, and of course I haven't read the script but I loved the novel...when are you shooting?
It's alright, isn't it?
It's an object lesson in grace.  Wow!  Look who's here before me!  My leading man is on time for once.
You're coming swimming in the pool, and in a few minutes you won't even remember what it's about.  You won't care who's in your damn movie.
Oh.
Didn't I say?
Oh.
I'll change back before we leave.
Oh my God, the sitter.
I'm not so sure.  Look again in three months.
But she's alright.
Nice to meet you.
Do you want me to save you?  Do you want me to save you?
Let me heal you, baby.
Just every once in a blue moon, you know.
Whatever you say.  Listen, I love you.
There's still time to undo this.
You invited her to our anniversary party? I didn't even invite my mother.
She goes on location tomorrow.  Sally, I'm sorry.  Look, I can't keep her on hold.
Really?
You can never be too early or too thin.
It's ecstasy, Sal.
He'll find his way back.
Otis, good boy, come here.  Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
Sally, so I took a few pills.  I went out dancing.  I tried to forget how upset I was about splitting up with you.  I haven't lied to you.  I told you about the people I've slept with.  I just didn't mention the few occasions I took drugs because you're so fucking judgmental I knew I'd never hear the end of it, and you have so little faith and so little trust in me.  Sally, we're back, I love you.  Trust that.  Please let's not do this.
It's not like this all the time.
I had an abortion two weeks ago.
I told you when we met I never wanted children.  I don't want kids in my life. We talked about it.  You weren't listening.
I don't want to go tonight.
I know.  It's for the baby's crib.
Oh, you know, I am.
She'll never call again.  She called last week to tell me she'll never call again. Where's Sally?
Come on, Panes...
Oh my God, I'm a huge Skye Davidson fan. She's very beautiful.
And I you.
But I'm always afraid I'll say something stupid.
It's Jerry's worst idea.
Not particularly.  Weird, isn't it?  God I'm rally up.  Do you feel anything yet, Mac?
You're an interior decorator, right?
In fits and starts -- and then, later, of course, she had to accommodate me.  So things shifted a little bit then, became more eclectic.  And it keeps changing.
Well, yes.  Yes, in fact.  A little on the outside, yes.  And there's been all this friction.
I'll be your best friend.
It's really not the same thing.  He was really nicer when he drank.
Yeah, well, it's just us and a few hundred of our closest friends.
I think you need to speak for yourself, Ryan.  But I think you're really nice people...
There's only you, Ryan.  You know what, Ryan?  You're beautiful.  I love you so much... You need...
You're not serious.
Are you working on a new book?
There's a goddamn sign on the gate.
Oh my god.  I've been so rude.  I'm Skye Davidson.  Has anyone ever told you, you look like Peter Sellers?
Who told you that?  No.  I'm twenty...  Five.
You don't know she's a bitch.
No, really, five thousand with your discount.
I don't want to talk about it.
Well, something's wrong.
You don't need to thank me.
We're going to have to go back out there.
Absolutely.  You always wonder where your books end up.  Why don't we use it?
Nevermind.
She's such a great photographer.
A notch above the storage room.
So how much do you hate her?
Oh Soph...
Let's go in the kitchen and spy on everyone.
You weren't exactly horrified.
His sister does.  Big time.  And the New York Times says addiction is genetic -- I'll e-mail you the article.
Well, you weren't fine last summer when you went Sylvia Plath on me in Connecticut.
But I am a possessive, fragile neurotic.
Nobody told me digging was so much fun!  You pick up the dirt, you move it, you pick it up again, you move it again -- lots of repetitions, you exercise the forceps, and the pincers --
Sorry I got you in trouble.  But listen, you can share my rations.
I'll make myself available...Listen, better watch out with the backtalk.  I don't know want you to end up like the guy who used to work next to me.  I'm afraid he got... <u>downsized</u>.
Well, actually, uh -- I'm sort of making it up --
Aren't you gonna stand up for yourself?
Ah, yes.  Well, charmed, I'm sure.  So, Princess, have you ever danced with a hero?
That's not what you said the <u>other</u> <u>night</u> --
Alright, alright, I'll try to get directions from one of the locals.
Of course!  It defines society!  To deny the precept is to say that order is an arbitrary distinction applied by the society itself!
I was <u>slumming it</u>!  I danced with you because you were the most pathetic specimen in the place!
Well, that's an appealing offer, but...considering the options...  You go back.  Me, I'm going to Insectopia.
Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap.
Stop fooling around in there.
Come on...tell me there wasn't just a little...something between us that first night at the bar.  The night we danced.
You were right...you were right!  Z, it's <u>beautiful</u>!
Well, "trouble" is my middle name. Actually, my  middle name is .985, but I don't tell people.  Hey, Bala, I...I actually have something of yours...you left it at the bar that night.
There's something going on, Z --
It's just that -- well, I'm honored that you selected me, and everything, I just thought the marriage might go a little more smoothly if -- we had a conversation?
Yes -- but I did my duty and sorted out all those messy feelings.  The wonderful thing about ant life is that everything is arranged.  Even marriage.  You're lucky -- General Formica is a paragon of anthood.
Darling, you must encourage the troops -- wave!
Maybe they went out for the evening. Let's leave them a message and head home.
Princess!  You look -- outstanding. Is there anything I can do for you?
I've never seen anything like it, General, they're they're...well, look!
Well now <u>you</u> haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality, have you?
Good.  You're a good soldier.
Royal victory party?  Will...will Princess Bala be there?
So...you two are in love?
Yes, and do you know <u>why</u> there's a food shortage?
Can't we all settle this like adults -- we're not larvae anymore --
Please don't worry, your majesty. Leave the worrying to me.  As you know, I'm not an ant of half- measures.  I don't pussyfoot around. This crisis is my number one priority, and I promise you it's being dealt with swiftly, and decisively.
Alright, let's move out!
YES!!!  You know, people ask me, "Doctor, why are you always happy?" And I tell them it's mind over matter.  I don't <u>mind</u> that I don't <u>matter</u>!  Do you get it?  Do you get it?
Come on -- everybody dumps on us workers.  You soldiers get all the glory.  Plus you get to go out into the world, meet interesting insects, and kill them.
What's gonna go wrong?!  I take your place for the royal inspection.  Bala comes strolling down the line, she sees me -- <u>bingo</u>!  Love is rekindled, and she takes me up to the palace for a little...  tea and crumpets... and you take your place again, and go march around to your heart's content!
What do I do?
One napkin, coming up.  I wish we had some champagne to wrap it around.
Why not? Now that they're kicking me upstairs --
I'd love to hear them. Maybe we could have lunch in the cafeteria sometime -- or some evening, after work --
I'm sorry, but I can't tonight. I'm meeting somebody.
No. Like a man.
Just tell 'em -- now and then.
Eight-thirty.
Meet you in the lobby. Okay?
In the last six weeks you've only been in my elevator once -- and then you didn't take your hat off.
Well, as a matter of fact, I was rather hurt when you stood me up that night --
Really? You mean you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with somebody in a hat like this?
Maybe if I wore it a little more to the side --  is that better?
I understand. Christmas -- family and all that --
I'd better get back to my elevator. I don't want to be fired.
Oh, yes -- office party -- Miss Olsen --
Where's my dress? I have to go home.
Well, I haven't figured it out, exactly.
I mean -- her apartment.
No -- it's my stomach.
I don't want it.
Maybe he does love me -- only he doesn't have the nerve to tell his wife.
-- Mr. Sheldrake.
I wouldn't say that --  What would you like to have for diner? There's onion soup and canned asparagus --
Over a girl?
No, I don't.
That's terrible.
Might as well go all the way.
You mean, leaving his wife? Yeah. I'm very happy for you.
Think.
There's a certain key floating around the office -- from Kirkeby to Vanderhof to Eichelberger to Dobisch -- it's the key to a certain apartment -- and you know who that apartment belongs to?
You better.
Well, that's very kind of you -- only I'm not feeling well -- you see, I have this cold -- and I thought I'd go straight home.
Oh?  Oh!
You too, sir.
You see a girl a couple of times a week -- just for laughs -- and right away she thinks you're going to divorce your wife. I ask you -- is that fair?
Yeah.  You know, Baxter, I envy you. Bachelor -- all the dames you want -- no headaches, no complications --
Yeah --
You know that other key to your apartment -- well, when we had that little scare about Miss Kubelik, I thought I'd better get rid of it quick -- so I threw it out the window of the commuter train.
I'm not just bringing anybody -- I'm bringing Miss Kubelik.
How's that again?
Thank you, sir.
Now hold on, Baxter --
Oh, this is Mr. Matuschka -- he's Miss Kubelik's -- he's got a cab downstairs --
Oh, yes.  She's the best operator in the building.
Instead of Friday -- could you possibly switch to Thursday? You'd be doing me a great favor --
Well -- it's all right with me, Bud. Let me check. I'll get back to you.
Baxter, I don't want to pull rank on you -- but I told the lady it was all set -- you want to make a liar out of me?
Buddy-boy, that's the worst thing you can do. If you got a cold, you should go to a Turkish bath -- spend the night there -- sweat it out --
Oh, no. I'd get pneumonia -- and if I got pneumonia, I'd be in bed for a month -- and if I were in bed for a month --
Okay, you made your point. We'll just have to do it next Wednesday -- that's the only night of the week I can get away.
You know, Baxter, you're a real cutie-pie -- yes, you are.
Miss Kubelik -- Fran.
Sure.
Sure, Doc.
I don't know. All I know is I got to get out of this place.
Booze we don't need. Why don't you join us, Baxter? We got two brain surgeons, an ear, nose and throat specialist, a proctologist, and three nurses from Bellevue.
Forget it -- I didn't do it as a doctor -- I did it as a neighbor.  By the way, whatever happened to her?
What about him?
You got a girl-friend?
Stuck on her! Obviously, you don't know me very well.
Gee. Sort of gives you goose-bumps just to think about it.
Good night?
What's the matter? Did I do something wrong?
It's an emergency -- see you some other time.
That's right.
I want you back, Fran.
Okay. I'm sorry.
What do you think?
Yeah -- that's me. The Happy Idiot -- a million laughs.
Is that what's been bothering you -- Miss Olsen? That's ancient history.
It won't always be like this.  I love you, Fran.
He wouldn't give me the key to the apartment.
What are you talking about?
I'd spell it out for you -- only I can't spell.
Sylvia -- sweetie -- it's not that -- but I promised the guy I'd be out of here by eight o'clock, positively.
You let me go four years ago, Jeff. Only you were cruel enough to make me sit out there and watch the new models pass by.
I'd appreciate it if you'd be out of here as soon as you can.
See if they'll what?
Oh -- oh!
My men --
One for all -- all for one --
Which part is that ?
Delta ?
What unit were you with ?
Let's talk about you.
A long time.
Who are you ?
I hate that -- Every time I hear that noise something terrible happens.
Chef -- is that 'cause you like mangoes an' stuff?
That's right, sir -- I come from New Orleans -- I was raised to be a sauciere.. a great sauciere. We specialize in sauces; my whole family. It's what we do. I was supposed to go to Paris and study at the Escoffier School; I was saving the money. They called me for my physical so I figured the Navy had better food.
What are you doing out here?
No shit.
That we're dumber than we look.
No -- most of 'em are still standing -- might've been disease.
Thta's not Charlie's work --
What is it?
He's in the L.B.J. -- didn't give him no medals or nothing --
You can see, of course, the implications, if any of this -- even rumours leaked out.
Charlie?
This gentleman or myself ?
I've worked with them on occasions and I saw the movie , sir.
Of course. I -- Once we make our repairs, we could send word, we could have you evacuated from here.
What?
What?
It's hairy ,though. That's where we lost McDonnel -- they shot the hell out of us. It's Charlie's point.
You want'a surf, soldier?
I got bored in Saigon.
That village you're pointing at is kinda hairy.
And I don't intend to get some of them chewed up just to get your tub put in the mouth of the goddman Nung River. You say you don't know Kurtz?
You were not coming here, to see me?
No water.
What are you doing?
I'm taking you back. You can still live.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
You had immense plans... immense plans...
You get to know each other pretty well out there.
You knew him best.
Yes I was... He said his last words to me.
Want to say goodbye to the Colonel?
No -- I don't think so. But it'll be back. They were circling. It'll be back.
It's of strategic importance for keeping the highway into Bat Shan open -- the generals don't like to admit that Bat Shan is surrounded.
Why did they attack us?
No sir, I think -- this'll be a little bit different --
Used to see the natives eating roots when I was a kid in Nome.
I'll get you there all right.
There isn't one, unless Corbett's men get here before the plane does.
I was hoping you had some news --
Not me.  I'm equipped.
Fairbanks is a three-hour flight. I'll be back by dinnertime.
Leave my traps.  We'll tag up, couple days.
I needed a pilot's license to take the job here, so I got one in six weeks.
With light clothing and no supplies, this is nobody's territory.
Pushing it is flat wrong.  All you prove is your ignorance about breaking trail.
How many do you see?
You got a knack for seeing things the way you want to see them.
You broke the radio, remember?
If that was all, fine.  But carving him up, stranding the others, that's too fucking much. Is everything that walks, crawls, flies or swims fair game to you?
Have you heard anything from the girl staying with me, Anne Marie?
Not a damn thing.  What's going on?  Mr. Meyerling was here, all steamed up, looking for you.
Corbett ruined my two-way.  Go to my place on the Haul Road, tell Anne Marie I'm okay and to sit tight.
Bastards killed Sam, you think they won't kill the rest of us?
I should release Corbett because you want some votes?
That's what we should've done in the first place.
Cool out.  I ain't about to get blasted.
Doesn't matter.  We know where they're going.  C'mon.
I don't need one 'cause I know what's really going on here. I have to finish this letter or I'll go nuts.  This can't be right -- con- science.
Go ahead.
Leave me be! Why are you doing this? Why are you picking at my sores... What is it that you want?... You want what? What's with you? I hope getting me thinking of everything that's wrong when all I want is to not do this has some purpose.  What is it, Mom? No kidding.
Uh-huh.
Yes.
Only in the emergency room or when he was well.
No.
They're considerable. But Mr. Udall wants to be billed.
I've got Jews at my table.
If I had to guess by your eyes, I'd say you were fifty.
Okay!!!! Anything else?!?
No, sir...
Are you still coming?
Oh.  We might. Yes. We can. Let's.
Oh. Okay, then -- Melvin. Good night.
It's okay. No problem. Where should we sit?
You like sad stories -- you want mine.
That wasn't payment. When you first came into breakfast, when I saw you -- I thought you were handsome... Then, of course, you spoke... So now that your soft li'l underbelly is all exposed. Tell me, why did you bring me?
I don't know why I brought you -- that idea occurred to me is all... It came out first... Hey, you kiss him -- me... He says he loves you. You two hit it off. But you don't want to... fine... Forget what I said about sex with Simon. It was a mistake.
I should've danced with you.
I'm gonna grab you.  I didn't mean it to be a question. I'm gonna grab you.
No, let me pull over so I can pay full attention.
No!!!
You don't want to mess with me today. I'll figure something else out tomorrow.
Yeah. If his parents are alive they've got to help -- those are the rules. Good.
'Love was... '
Well, that's a load off.
Verdell?
That cleaning woman doesn't...
Please, just leave.
Oh, my gosh.
Let's do the small talk in the car. Load up.
This stuff is pointless.
Wouldn't your lie be a lot easier if you were not...
Look, I've got to get a hold of Frank and see where I'm hanging my hat 'cause...
Hey... I'm charged here. But she might kill me for showing up this late.
Aw come on, just a couple of questions -- how hard is that?
No. No. No. Hey, that painting in there...  I just want to tell you...
What restaurant?
What?
Tachlinkov.
Sick.  The flu.
Know what?
I know.  It was a joke.
Tomorrow.  The buyer is Japanese. His retirement a condition of the bonus.
I bet you fucking know!
He stole another contract.
Took a guess.  Lucky for you, I guessed right.
Who the fuck are you?  Who do you work for?
You're one of them, aren't you?  A fucking pro.
No, stay in the car.  I want you to understand something.  If I intended to kill you, you would already be dead.
So this is something between you and him?
Yes.
Yes.
Right.
I don't need you to get the money -- my money!
Because he took a contract on you. He'll come for you and he'll find you.
Right now, as we sit here, he is tearing through your apartment.  He is digging through your drawers, emptying your closets.  He will take your telephone and address books, your appointment books.  If you keep a diary, he is reading it.  He'll go into the kitchen and find out what kind of food you eat, liquor you drink, cigarettes you smoke.  In the bathroom he will find any prescription drugs you take and where you get them filled.  If you have video tape or recordings he will watch and listen to all of them.
We played with a code using <u>The New</u> <u>York Times</u> obituaries.  Over three years we played twelve matches.  I never won.
Why didn't you finish this game?
The same way everyone does; the government, the Agency.
They are very good at what they do. It's very seductive.  The training, the weapons, the travel --
The exotic women.
This is fiction!  Don't you see that?  This is another reality.  And the people that come into the world to play this game -- nobody forces them!  They're here, they know the rules, the stakes, the risks!  Do you understand what I am saying?  No one is innocent -- including you!
I don't know.
You should.  It's very important, that the body release the energy that builds in it.
It's too late now.  Okay?  We'll have to deal with these.
Aiiee.  More waiting?  I don't know if I like this plan.
You killed him here?  In this city, outside that bank?
I don't believe that.
What happened?
What did he want?
I think I got one today.
Five million dollars will buy a lot of Rolaids.
It was no big deal.  I saw them leave, I went in.
Why?
Am I attractive?
Yes.
Right.
How can a beautiful man like you be shy?
Do you believe that?
You're pretty famous aren't you?
I know this may seem like a strange question, but can I ask you how much the contract was for -- not to insult you or anything, I know you're a professional, but just for me, I was just wondering.
That's what our General Contractor told us but how can you trust someone like that?
Do they get down on their knees, begging and crying?
A coke, if they have it?
Son of the American ambassador and a banker - good enough?
No, just crap. I want some picture frames.
Still, fifty cents ain't bad.
Squatted it.
So? DOUG Well, there's tons of empty buildings - why don't we get one?
Well, providing we're treated like Czechs and we squat something that's not privately owned, we should be in the clear; at least DOUG  until they get an eviction order and bring in the bailiffs.
No "if's" or "but's" it's a cinch. Do you want to know what the icing is?
Don't worry, I'll give you a hand as soon as I can.
Tell them we're working for the University.
Tough break.
Nope, not even close. I've thought of a name for this place and you were the inspiration though.
No....The Asylum!
Yes, but it suddenly clicked, this is going to be a crazy place and, since the Commies are used to seeking asylum, we can use that in the marketing.
It must be fair old size, suppose it's empty?
No way, it's sealed - if she's in there she's dead.
Don't worry if the old lady's there I'll brick it back up.
Is it gone four-thirty?
We don't speak Czech!
No, it could take me hours. You know what it's like trying to find things in this town, not to mention disposable stuff - I wouldn't think they've ever heard of them.
What?
A fine specimen for conversion.
You might make Henry happy......Sure, I'll do it.
Good, and then type up a notice on your computer for tonight's thing, photocopy it and put it up in all the faculty buildings and a couple of the pubs. It'll start at eight o'clock and the bar will be open from seven. Holly and I'll go and get some beer and wine.  Can you bankroll the bar for tonight?
He's lying! I am.
So?
Suppose those contained all the file info too? You could have a third or so of it there.
Siberia.
In return for Doug's freedom, I was never to see him again, I had to - it was his only chance.
No!
Sure I'm sure!
Yeah!
I'm just here to record some details, standard stuff.
Here's the details.
I don't care. I'm not staying out late Doug.
Whatever!
You're everything a guy could want.
Not this time, Kat.
That's only the half of it. I've heard a rumour they're taking over a theatre to use for alternative arts; you know what that means?
I'm in close with these guys, it isn't easy, but slowly they're opening up to me. Give me a month and I'll blow their movement wide open.
Well she sure isn't normal.
Well, I've failed at everything else I've done and I can't hack it as a journalist, even for the Bugler.
I moving more to Communism now it's dying out.
First, I want to walk free with a letter, in English, from the Prosecutor General dropping all charges. Second, I want two first class tickets to London leaving tonight and three thousand crowns in a stamped envelope. Lastly, all actions against the students are to be stopped!
No problem, is it at your place?
Shit Honey, you could've told me. People might think it's about us!
See you brought one of the patients with you too.
It's time to go home, Holly.
You know everyone can be controlled Pavel. Where are you storing the personnel files?
The files are in a sealed room and the University are under strict orders to stay away.
Some Americans?
That was not my decision, I can only guess that one day we will again be active and our honour restored. In the meantime no one else must know those files exist. Secure the building and I will arrange alternative safe storage immediately.
You sleeping with her?
Whatever my life is, I'm going to be friggin' sure I'm never disappointed --
Be yourself and I don't think there is a wrong thing.  Let Jamie take the lead. She'll let you know what she needs.
Landon, honey. There's nothing more.
I don't make small talk --
'Yes. You're-you're b-b- beautiful.'
Go for it.
You want to tell me...
I do know.  Be two places at once... learn to hit a baseball or turn a cartwheel... eat breakfast with chopsticks...
He's a softy. Got him wrapped around my finger.
Do you think I'm strange?
There is no point. You live. You die. The end.
Your father doesn't like me.
You don't miss a thing.
And why would that scare me?
No.  But are you -- impressed?
I wanted this to be a date.
That what's happening to you, only faster?
Maybe you're not supposed to.
Where?
You planned this --
Where? Why?
I made you do too many things, kept you up all night --
No.
It's time to tell him.  It would be the right thing.
Lead man.
Does it have to do with Jamie?
If there is a God, how could he let this happen??!!
I helped Jamie with the first one.
She did. It was you.
I want to come back.
I didn't say you did.
I've seen students with records like yours go to J.C. for a couple of years, then transfer to a good college.
Yeah.
I don't get it. How come there's no rock 'n roll?
Gimme some chili, fries, and a Tab.
Oh yeah.
Uh, hi....
How could I forget?  Oh, sure, I remember you.
Listen,  Professor Brown told me you called last night and gave me your message...
Learn anything?
Jeez, what do you think? To see it!
Okay, then!
You're not gonna hurt me. Just hit me in the stomach.
George it's not your concern. Don't worry about it. Just remember that at 9:00, you'll be strolling through the parking lot and you'll see us -- struggling in the car, you'll run over, open the door and say....?
Not a holocaust --
Hey, Mr. Arky, gimme a break!  I'm seventeen years old! I'm not responsible for all these problems!
You're the only Mr. Lewis in this class.  If you have something to say, say it so the whole class can hear.
Well, yeah, I was thinking, if cars are gonna be going two or three hundred miles an hour, they're gonna be using an awful lot of gas. Like, what if we run out?
Run out of gas?
Five cents, please.
Pro, the sun's out!
Oh, right, right... 
Now hold on a minute, Professor! Hold the phone. Are you trying to tell me that this -- all of this here -- that this is -- it's a -- a --
Oh, yeah.
We don't....
Well, it was there.
Nobody said anything about hitting her! You're just going to take a few liberties with her.
Look, Marty, she's not your mother yet. And if you don't go through with this, she may never be. I know it's hard, but there are some things we must do in life that are unpleasant. Some choices must be made that are difficult. Nonetheless, we must make them. Besides, this may be more than a simple question of your own existence, he added. The fate of the entire space-time continuum may rest on your shoulders . Marty tried to smile at him.
Professor -- there are some doors that shouldn't be opened, Marty said softly, without turning around.
87 states? Time travel bans? What the hell?
According to your girlfriend, Suzy Parker, you and she were at the movies. You went to the restroom and you never came out. Obviously, you stepped through an inter-dimensional time warp, created by the original operation of the time machine.
Is  something going to happen Saturday night?
Oh yeah?
Yeah, he said for you to give us a lift into town. You're the ones with the Studebaker, aren't you?
You don't mind?
You expect me to believe that?
Okay.
Thirty aught six.
Then why'd you do it?
I need to get your signature on some papers here, Kit.
Is that right?
Well, I've felt that way, hadn't you?
Can I be honest?
It's your play.
We better call the doctor... Listen. I'll say how it happened, part I saw.
You don't believe me, see for yourself.
They're not going to listen to me. You either. Are you kidding?
I don't know.
I don't want a steak.
Positive?
I don't blame him.
It was going too fast.
No.
Yeah, but the thing about him, he's down with the flu. He's sick.
Good a way to kill time as any... She okay?
Listen, ah... We're going to take the Cadillac for a while. How'd that be?
It's mine all right.
Halloween. 1938..."War of the Worlds"...that fake radio news broadcast that got everybody scared, thinking that real live Martians were landing in Grover's Mill, New Jersey!  But then it all just turned out to be a hoax.
Careful...don't make noise and don't touch me.  I'm hotter than flapjacks.
What?
It's an antidote. A formula.  Whoever it was on the phone made me scribble this and gave me the ability to penetrate their disguises.
Have you warned Professor Hikita?
First thing I did.
Buckaroo, somebody shanghaied the Professor!
Just 'grazed' you, huh?
Arachtoid.
Let her out?  She's a killer.
Where's the professor?
Figures.  Anybody seen my scope?
I guess 'cause you remind me of someone I once knew, long ago before any of this craziness.
Who?
Yes, I do.  Gimme a chance.  I'm stronger than you think.
Please, Penny.  You just gotta trust me now.  Okay?  And don't panic. Because it's gonna be all right.
What?  If we just believe in Buckaroo Banzai?
Yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself.
You look!  It's not here!
Government work.  Had my own think tank.  Got tired of thinking-wanted some action.  Seen plenty of it too.  So will you if you stick around.
No, sometimes he just... well, he thinks about Estelle. His wife still lives in Fayettesville. She's... disturbed.
Okay, but that doesn't excuse his â€
...Who is this?
Hah!
All right, forget the heads. Where's Mundt, Fink?
So be it.
Mmm. Wal, me, I just enjoy maikn' things up. Yessir. Escape... It's when I can't write, can't escape m'self, that I want to tear m'head off and run screamin' down the street with m'balls in a fruitpickers pail. Mm...
And what would that be, son?
I need help, Audrey.
We need Indians for a Norman Steele western.
Wallace Beery. Wrestling picture. What do you need, a road map?
Well, to tell you the truth, I'm having some trouble getting startedâ€
I'm not sure anymore. I guess I try to make a difference.
That's all right, really, thank you.
Well, I'm a writer, actually.
Can be. Not easy, but â€
Hell yes. Because I believe in it. Fire, theft, and casualty are not things that only happen to other people â€ that's what I tell 'em. Writing doesn't work out, you might want to look into it. Providing for basic human need â€ a fella could do worse.
Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.
No, I'm actually writing for the pictures now â€
Pictures! Jesus!
Oh, it's an exciting time then. I'm not the best-read mug on the planet, so I guess it's no surprise I didn't recognize your name. Jesus, I feel like a heel.
And that's the point, that we all have stories. The hopes and dreams of the common man are as noble as those of any king. It's the stuff of life â€ why shouldn't it be the stuff of theater?  Goddamnit, why should that be a hard pill to swallow? Don't call it new theater, Charlie; call it real theater. Call it our theater.
Well, I can tell you some stories â€
Charlie. How are you.
No... I guess it's something about my work. I get so worked up over it, I don't know; I don't really have a lot of attention left over, so it would be a little unfair...
Okay, but hell, you should know what it is. I can show you in about thirty seconds.
Well, it's been better. I can't seem to get going on this thing. That one idea, the one that lets you get started â€ I still haven't gotten it. Maybe I only had one idea in me â€ my play. Maybe once that was done, I was done being a writer.  Christ, I feel like a fraud, sitting here staring at this paper.
Seems like I hear everything that goes on in this dump. Pipes or somethin'. I'm just glad I don't have to ply MY trade in the wee-wee hours.
Charlie, I'm in trouble â€ something horrible's happened â€ I've gotta call the police...
Thanks, but I wanted a place that was less...
Boy! You writers! Work hard, play hard!  That's what I hear, anyway...
CAN you?  You damn well better be. Jesus, if I hadn't been honest in my business dealings â€ well, of course, you can't always be honest, not with the sharks swimming around this town â€ but if you're a writer, you don't think about those things â€ if I'd been totally honest, I wouldn't be within a mile of this pool â€ unless I was cleaning it. But that's no reason for you not to be. Honest, I mean.  Not cleaning the pool.
KISS THIS MAN'S FEET!!
I apologize, Barton.
Yes sir, they â€
I'm checking in. Barton Fink.
What do you do, Fink?
Doctor. Ear, nose and throat man,.
Physician, heal thyself.
You didn't tell us you knew the dame.
You two have some sick sex thing?
No, not yet Jack. We just bought the story. Saturday Evening Post.
This man creates for a living! He puts food on your table and on mine! THANK him for it!  Thank him, you ungrateful sonofabitch! Thank him or YOU'RE fired!
All night?
What are you gonna do -- charge me with smoking?
I'm fine.  Come on, Beth!  You know I'm fine!  How the hell long do I have to keep doing this?
I thought you quit.
Yes.  I care about you.  I did it for you.
Did you know Noah Goldstein?
What?
I found some in my purse; would you like one?
No.  I said I liked Johnny to use his hands.  I don't give any rules, Nick.  I go with the flow.
I've got a degree in psych.  It goes with the turf.  Games are fun.
No, thanks.
Four shootings in five years.  All accidents.
You want a name from the present? How about Hazel Dobkins?
She wiped out her whole family.
You can make a mistake.
Not me.
I know, Nicky, but I like it.
A boy kills his parents.  They have a plane.  He makes it look like an accident.
You mean did I write it before my parents died?
I'll meet you there.
No.
When?
Why?
I did, too.  She told me it was backwards -- she said you even styled your hair the way she did.
No.
I'm writing a book.
Really.  What are you writing about.
How did it end?
What is this -- some kind of... Joke?  Are we playing games again?
We fuck like minks.  We forget the rugrats.  We live happily ever after.
How's that?
That's pretty cold, ain't it, lady?
What kind of talk?
The usual -- a girlfriend.
Not now he don't.
It's my first drink in three months. That okay with you, pop?  She doesn't know me.  I never saw her before Gus and I talked to her.
I don't son, but I got the minority opinion.
What in the hell for?  You think I'm gettin' any at my age?  I don't like blue-haired women.  I don't like 'em.
I feel fine!
Why not?
Maybe she did, Gus.  Maybe she grew herself an Afro and learned a left hook and put shoe polish on her face.  Let's polygraph her again and ask her about it.
He looks a little shrunk, that's all.
What was it?
You don't but it, do you?  She knew nobody would but it.  She knew I'd say she did it.  And she knew nobody would buy it.
I don't think she meant to go off the hill, do you?
Catherine Tramell.  Age 30.  No priors, no convictions.  Double major, magnum cum laude, Berkeley, 1980.  Literature and Psychology. Daughter, sole survivor -- Marvin and Elaine Tramell, killed in a boating accident, 1978, Catherine Tramell sole heir.  Estimated assets $110 million.
Can there be some mistake?
Really. Huh. Too bad.
I wanted to make a few more of these. Frank's been drinking this Mexican beer. It makes a good green.
People are only interested in you because you're famous, not because they know a fuckin' thing about your work.
That would be a pity because you're a real painter.
Oh man, you a FINE nigga! You know that?
How do you know?
What do you mean?
Bring him over sometime. I have some other stuff to show him.
I'm here.
OK. I'll be at your studio Thursday three o'clock.
Oh, that's a "Leonardo's Greatest Hits" painting. You like it?
I see..  And... How do you respond to being called â€ hmmm...  â€ yes, "the pickaninny of the art world."
Really?
SAMO.
Concentrate on the ball. Shoot.
Oh, God, Basquiat, you scared the shit out of me. How the fuck could you do that to yourself?
Think so?
You mean babies with you?
Why does everybody say that? He's the only person I know who doesn't need to use me.
How is he?
Forget it.
George?
What's his name?
I've seen you before. I like your paintings a lot. Your hair was different.
Have a Mac.
Oh. I didn't know. I'll take you to the best restaurant in town.  You'll miss a great meal and I'll keep the scarf, anyway. What's your name?
I can put you in the ring with him. Even book the dates.  But those big boys know how to fight. They could make you look real sissy.  I was looking at that painting upstairs. It's the first time a picture made me embarrassed to own anything.  So what's your real name? 'Samo?'
Singing on stage and painting in your spare time.
I didn't know Tony Bennett painted.
My point exactly.
What time is it?
A what?
Yo... You know why Rammellzee's here, don't you?
"Affair" ... yes, maybe ... if she ...
I tried to grab you -- save you --
I'm listed.
Scare me?  No, actually, I was just scaring myself ...
I wouldn't be caught dead.  No, it's probably how I would be caught.  The Mayor stupidly took Cobblepot's bait --
"We"?  You and...
Executive Assistant.  Secretary.  Girlfriend?
What went wrong?  Hang on, I think I know ... You kept things from her.
Jesus, Selina, you're not the judge <u>or</u> the jury... I mean, just who do you think you <u>are</u>?
Appetite for destruction? Contempt for the czars of fashion? Wait don't tell me ... Naked sexual charisma?
You're off the hook, Ozzie.  But Batman is decidedly <u>not</u>.
... eight, seven...
Silent night, violent night...
My god ... it's true.  The Penguin- Man of the sewers ... Please, don't h--
Quiet, Max.  What do you think, this is a conversation?
Well it's not working.
I could teach her my "French flipper" trick...
Sidetracked?  Oswald, this is your chance to fulfill a destiny that your parents carelessly discarded ...
I think you'd feel out of place at my party.  You see, it's for winners.
I must protect my interests, Ms. Kyle.  And Interest Number One, is <u>moi</u>.
It's good to see you again, Uncle. I've missed you.
As I've missed you.  Sleep well, child.
I'm so sorry to trouble you, but-
You'd be surprised.
Freeze, you're mad.  This capsule will slaughter thousands.
We have eleven minutes to stop Freeze And thaw the city.
How about, nice to see you?  Glad you're here to save my life.
Open Sesame...Chicken.
She knows who we are.
From the other side of the equator-
Actually, I already work for you. Or did.  Your arboreal preservation project in South America.
We cut our support.  A conflict of ideologies.  Dr. Woodrue was a lunatic.
<		Maybe it's something in the water.
Like hell you do.
There was nothing I could do.  Batman deactivated her.  She's dead.
At you?  Polly want a kiss?
Kiss me and I'll tell you.
Freeze has turned the new telescope into a freezing gun.  He's about to turn Gotham into an ice cube.
What exactly are you working on in there?  What are those screams?
Without your research, I could never have come this far.  Join me.  The two of us, entwined, side by side...
Hello, Jason.  I think I've had a change of heart.
It's a wonder you sleep at all.
Your parents' wake. Rain fell like tears.
He killed them. Two-Face. He slaughtered that boy's parents.
He ran away?
Dr. Meridian...
Not that young. It's been a long time since you've called me that.
Old habits die hard. Are you alright?
Perhaps the fall...
What?
...A bat.
No demons, son.  Your monsters are here. Until you fact that, I fear you will spend your life fleeing them.
And you are?
What's wrong?
Last night at the circus. I noticed something about Dent. His coin. He's obsessed with justice. It's his Achilles' heel. It can be exploited.
It's the car, right? Chicks love the car.
My life's an open book. You read?
Mr. Nygma, you'll forgive me for being rude. But what exactly is on your mind?
We'll talk some other -
Nostrovia.
Rinka.
Not much.
Come on, Bruce. This is what I do for a living.
What?
Stop fighting.
Oh God, Bruce, you were a child. You weren't responsible.
What are you talking about?
I figure telling that cop I'd stay here saved me a truckload of social service interviews and good will. So no offense but thanks. See ya.
Look, spare me the sermons, okay. You're just some rich guy who is trying to do a good deed. You don't even know me.
Bruce, you can't.
Who is it?
It's Dr. Meridian. Chase. Do you remember me?
Paranoid? The psychotic?
Just call us Harvey. Can we get you a sandwich? A soft drink? Given all the trouble we caused you, how about we cut you in for a share of tonight's haul?
You know, if you cut your bathroom in half, you'd have my apartment.
WHICH CAR?
Quite a while. I took the scenic route.
That can't be right. That would mean every shipment of every product is poisoned. We'd all be dead.
Great.  Give me a grant.
What is it you want?
Yeah, a drink. 'Civilized,' right?
What did you see?
I see.  If I know how you really feel, I won't like you as much.
I'll take you home if you'd like.
Sometimes... I don't know if there's enough of me left to save.
Very thoughtful. Don't touch it.
Finding out where she is.
What are you talking about?
Oh, Jack.  -- Don't forget your lucky deck.
Nobody wants a war, Carmine.  If we can't do business, we shake hands and part friends.
That's it.
Please! We'll talk. Just tell us what you expect.
Oh, it's too good.  We got a six-foot bat that swoops out of the night and preys on evildoers.
His face.  Allie, look at his face.
Something like this -- what do you suppose this could drive a guy to?
Allie, I know exactly why you're doing this.
Bruce Wayne is out of his mind.  Next time you call him up and he can't go out Friday night - - think it over.
Your face smells like a foot.
It's okay.  There's no one out here. Just open the door.  Trust me.
I know you are.  Very serious ... most of the time these days.
But the particular glory of the system... is that it can also work oh large screens in each individual room - so we can network the program to every room in the gallery.
Ah. Fine.  It's good.  It's great.
Saw her at the movies the other night with that boss of hers.  Nice guy.  Good looking.
Yes.  Ahm.  I was just wondering where my English house guest had got to.
Right.  Got it.
I beg your pardon?
I'm er ... sorry if you've been waiting a long time.
Yes, this is Doctor Bean.
... you have to sack me.  I understand, sir.  I'll go quietly.  In fact I'll go right now.
Ahm....
Mmmmm...
Ah ... Jennifer, I need you to watch Kevin.  Jen?
Uh, huh huh... We'll do it, sir.
Yeah, heh heh. I thought there'd be casinos and lights and stuff.
Uh... Buuuuut. Boot. Someone named boot.
Huh huh. This says Beavis.
And Boot-Head.
Me first!
Heh heh. Thank God.
Cut it out butt-hole!
Yeah, it's just the same thing over and over again.
Yeah! Boobs. Heh heh. I just wanna say that again. Boobs. Heh heh.
Yeah, and um, he used to hit me too.
Yeah, maybe some chicks too. Heh heh.
Bunghole...
Washington! That's where she was gonna meet up with ya?  Damn, she's goin' all the way!
Whoa! heh heh. Hey Butt-Head, this chick is pretty cool. She says there's gonna be tons of sluts in Las Vegas! Heh heh heh.
Why it's you two. How'd ya do in Vegas?
Uh, we didn't score yet.
Um, um, yeah, probably. Heh heh.
Dammit!  Where's that damn unit??!!
D.C., Chief.
Jesus jumped-up... Bork, can you imagine what would happen if they set that thing off in our nation's capital, or even worse, if they sold it to some damned foreigner at that conference.  Well, it's not gonna happen!
Bork, when this is all over, remind me to make you an appointment with Agent Hurley.
Not now Bork.
Uh, yeah. Does she have big hooters?
Well, then you know what I'm talking about. Anyway, here's the story. I scored with these two chicks. True story.
God... Manchurian Tung oil? There's enough to refinish the gateleg table <u>and</u> the cherry wardrobe!
I am sitting.
Hon... I didn't want to die, but really, this is fine with me.  As long as I never have to wash dishes again.
I don't know.  <u>Jane, Jane, up here</u>!
Won't?  Or can't?
Just says 'won't.'  Wait a minute. Here it says 'the living are arrogant... they think they'll never die, so they refuse to see the dead.'
Are you crazy?  She can't hear you.
Look at this, everything is different down here.  All our furniture is gone.
Bet... el... geuse.  What an awful name.  I thought it was like -- you know.  The <u>juice</u> of <u>beetles</u>.
All right.
I'm not scared of Ralph Lauren. Those are <u>sheets</u>.  Are you gross under there?  Are you <u>Night of the</u> <u>Living Dead</u> under there?  Like all bloody veins and pus?
And if we need <u>you</u> again, how do we...?
I'm so sorry we frightened you. What were you doing?
Our cemetery?
No, Lydia, we're dead.
'Bye, Jane, I'll see you in church in a couple weeks.
No, I mean they've gone. Decamped.  Split.  Vanished.
Where'd they go?
Sort of.  High spirit.  Heh heh. Listen, cookie, I've been trapped in this burg for hundreds of years.  All I want is to get out.
I can't help you from this side, but here's how we do it.  So <u>simple</u>.  Say my name three times. That's all.  I'll be all yours. Then I'll bring you over here in style.
Minor problem.  The rules.  I can't tell it to you.  But... do you know how to play charades?
Good thing you are beautiful, kid. You are <u>dumb</u>!
How'd you like to have the biggest boobs in the world?  Right now.  I can do it if I get out.
He's your cousin.
It's too late, Charles.  I'm sorry.
Otho, why didn't you just come in the door?
Otho'll know what to do.
I think she's in with them.
Let me have it.
I can't <u>bring</u> the ghosts.  They're not here!
Otho, could you actually... do something with them?
Nonsense, everytime she says that, the paint peels, and some wild creature tries to kill us.
Then we own a whole <u>town</u> full of nowhere.
Any particular kind?
The rest of the house is probably worse.  When can you and I get started?
<u>I know</u>... I read your book, <u>The</u> <u>Haunted Tapestries of the Waldorf</u>.
Gooood!
Oh, as long as we're here...
I have a feeling there's some very interesting space behind this door.
I don't know.
It's okay.  How's the dirt business?
I see.
... Oh? You've heard?
Thank you, Robert.
Oh, really?
In a minute, Robert - in a minute... Chauncey, I would like to ask a favor of you...
Not necessary, but preferable. I don't think he'll be a bother, he seems like a most refreshing sort of man.
He's very intense, and internal, don't you think?
Gentlemen, needless to say, there is going to be a full Congressional investigation of your respective operations.  Good night.
Fine. They felt that since you had such close ties with the President, you would be a splendid choice.  ... Can I help you? Are you looking for something?
... Why, yes, he is... Is your leg feeling any better?
Yes. My husband has been very ill. His doctor and nurses are staying with us. Those hospitals can be so impersonal - why, it might be hours before you are treated...
Fine, it will save a lot of unnecessary fuss and it will be so much more pleasant for you...  David, we'll just go on home. Jeffrey, would you call and let them know?
Oh? Certainly...
Hello, Eve.
Pardon me, was that Mr. Chance?
Was he a relative? Or an intimate friend?
Oh, I see... Your mentor, perhaps?
So am I, Eve.
... I have very few friends, Chauncey... And Benjamin's friends are all quite a bit older...
I know you are, Chauncey...  ... You conquer a woman from within herself, you infuse in her the need and desire and the longing for your love.
Chauncey, this is Mr. Dennis Watson of the State Department.
Yes. I like to watch.
... Is that all you want...?  ... To watch me...?
That's very interesting, Eve.
Yes. I've been looking for you, too, Eve.
The President is a nice person. I enjoyed it very much.
Do you realize, Mr. Gardiner, that more people will be watching you tonight than all those who have seen theater plays in the last forty years?
Yes, very well, thank you.
I agree.
Yes, so I've heard, a shame... As you know, we in the Soviet Union have the keenest interest in developments of the First American Financial Corporation... We are pleased to hear that you may fill Benjamin's place should he fail to recover.  Be seated, please, Mr. Gardiner.
Do you think so? Do you think so?
Yes, it is.  Would you tell me your name again, please?
Thank you.
I agree.
Well, that's good news, my boy.
Sure you do! No one reads!... Listen, book publishing isn't exactly a bed of roses these days...
Yes, I would like to see Ben.
I assure you, sir, David is a very careful driver. Please, won't you let us take you?
Yes. It seems to be.
I see.
Yes. It is.
I'd like to thank you for filling in on such short notice for the Vice President.
Thank you.
Louise?... The maid?...  But she should have left earlier today...
Since you were a child?
I may be a shut-in, but I do not lack for news. I'm sorry you had to go through all that.
Good evening, Wilson.
I shall take the gentleman to the third floor guest suite, ma'am. Dr. Allenby is standing by.
Huh... I'm glad they're along with her, if you know what I mean... How about Jack?
Yeah... He and my father used to ride together back in the thirties... Fox hunting... Before I was born...
Yes, Chauncey Gardiner.
We have word that the Soviets have put out a top priority alert for information on Gardiner's background. So far, they haven't come up with a thing - what's more, as a result of their eagerness, one of their ablest agents blew his cover, we have him in custody at this time.
Yes, I did.
I'm pretty sure it was you. Hey, could I get your autograph now? It's for .... oh, what the hell, it's for me! I'm your biggest fan!
Which one is Elijah again?
They'll understand. Besides I've got a morning appointment tomorrow with Elijah's shrink. We're getting to the bottom of this acid stomach.
She's very beautiful.
Hi.
The ferret?
The iguana.
Yeah. You want a beer?
We'll talk about it in the car.
Why?
No they're not.
I'm giving them up. I've changed. I've found a new focus.
What's that?
Yes.
Well, you have the Maxine action figure to play with.
Life is confusing, isn't it?
You're not a monster, Craig. Just a confused man.
Oh, right. As long as you're happy. I'm sure he's a better lover than I ever was.
Holy shit! He said what I said!
Holy shit! He said what I said!
Schwartz.
Pardon?
Not at all, Dr. Lester. I simply misspoke.
Just one. Why is this floor so short?
All right. Meet me at the Juicy-Juice Juice Bar after work today and I'll spill my goddamn guts for you.
Yessir.
That's sounds fine, sir. Gotta run.
The vacant office. I see. Olive oil. Interesting. Be warned, Schwartz, there are certain â€œdoorsâ€ which should never be opened.
No, really.
Who told you?
Yeah. But enough about me.
Well, I'm a puppeteer...
You're not someone I could get interested in. Craig. You play with dolls.
Lots of things. He's very well respected. That jewel thief movie, for example. The point is that this is a very odd thing, supernatural, for lack of a better word. It raises all sorts of philosophical questions about the nature of self, about the existence of the soul. Am I me? Is Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha right, is duality an illusion? Do you see what a can of worms this portal is? I don't think I can go on living my life as I have lived it. There's only one thing to do. Let's get married right away.
Do you have any idea what its like to have two people look at you with total lust and devotion through the same pair of eyes? No I don't suppose you would. It's quite a thrill, Craig.
Don, I was wondering, do you know why our workplace has such low ceilings?
Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter Malkovich and destroy him from the inside. If not me, who?
You can be John Malkovich.
Well, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will leave Malkovich, right? So, if he needs it, I help Mantini's performance a bit, give him an edge. Spice up the show.
Fine. I'm not mad. Let's just drop it.
Gehginnis ondah foam?
Do you?
You were stoned. Case closed. End of story. How hot is this babe?
I'm done with her now. Tonight really creeped me out.
Good. I think its time to beckon Mr. Flemmer. Perhaps He can help us out of this pickle.
Yes, of course, Dr. Lester.
But now we've lost access to Craig.
My child, I don't think its a great mystery what Craig's up to.
Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must inform you that I find that highly arousing.
No.
I have to see you.
We'll see, Schwartz. We'll see.
Say... "Equus"? It's got everything.
Who needs dancing?
Oh, Lotte...
Don't con me, Maxine. We're over. I just let you up here to tell you that, and to tell you that I'm taking you and Schwartz to court.
Sleepy suddenly.
What want ye, girl child?
There ain't.
Blue. That doesn't hurt nobody. Yellow neither.
You still know.
You remember Halle.
Baby, don't be like that.
Mama told you - I'd give up my own life, every minute, every hour of it to take back one of your tears baby...My children my best thing. You my best thing!
Don't pay to complain.
More than all right. Miss Bodwin, she teach me stuff..Book stuff. She says I might go to Oberlin. She's experimenting on me.
Yes sir
I will.
Morning, ma'am.
What you want there? Somebody invite you in?
Better ask Paul D.
It's cold as charity in there! What he do that for? Any number'll take him in.
Stamp, don't tear me up this morning! I don't feel like it.
Aw, no, Ella.
Leave off..
Don't talk to me, Mr. Sawyer. Don't say nothing to me this morning.
I'm looking for a gal name of Judy. Works over by the slaughterhouse. Said she lived on Plank Road.
You don't know her? Judy? Works in the slaughterhouse.
Yes sir..You right about that. That's just what I come over to talk to him about. Just that..
Yeah sure, if I'm ever in the neighborhood, need to use the john.
Huh.
Why me, man?
Sir, this is a mortuary, not a rental house.
This is a hundred and eighty dollars.
Yeah, but we're--
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR ELEMENT!  This Chinaman is not the issue, Dude.
Donny, shut the f--when do we play?
Where's your car, Dude?
Oh for Christ--will you shut the fuck up, Donny.
Shut the fuck up, Donny.  We'll, uh, brace the kid--he'll be a pushover. We'll get that fucking money, if he hasn't spent it already.  Million fucking clams. And yes, we'll be near the, uh--some burgers, some beers, a few laughs.  Our fucking troubles are over, Dude.
They won't hurt us, Donny.  These men are cowards.
I've had a--
I'm not really, uh.
Lebowski on the right?
Are these.
They're not his, heh-heh, they're not literally his children; they're the Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, inner-city children of promise but without the--
Mm.
Yeah.  Thanks man.
Oh, hey man, how are ya?  I wondered if I'd see you again.
Irish m--What the fuck are you talking about?  My name's Da Fino!  I'm a private snoop!  Like you, man!
Yes, they don't like hearing it and find it difficult to say.  Whereas without batting an eye a man will refer to his "dick" or his "rod" or his "Johnson".
Right, but let me explain something about that rug--
Excuse me?
Sex.  The physical act of love. Coitus.  Do you like it?
I was talking about my rug.
Don't be fatuous, Jeffrey.  Little matter to me that this woman chose to pursue a career
If you successfully do so, I will compensate you to the tune of 1% of the recovered sum.
A hundred.
Thousand, yes, bones or clams or whatever you call them.
I, uh... money, yeah, I gotta respecfully, 69 you know, tender my resignation on that matter, 'cause it looks like your mother really was kidnapped after all.
Hey man, why don't you fucking listen occasionally?  You might learn something.  Now I got--
The main guy, Dieter--
Well--yeah, I guess--
Beaver?  You mean vagina?--I mean, you know him?
Huh?  Autobahn.  A-u-t-o.  Their music is a sort of--ugh--techno-pop.
Well, uh. . . Not much to tell.
I keep telling you, it's the Foundation's money.  Father doesn't have any.
But your father--he runs stuff, he--
Well...no, of course not--
I want a child.
Exactly.  What happened to your face? Did Jackie Treehorn do that as well?
What?
You're fucking twenty minutes late. What the fuck is that?
This is a league game.  This determines who enters the next round- robin, am I wrong?
The man is a sex offender.  With a record.  Spent six months in Chino for exposing himself to an eight- year-old.
They hung up, Walter!  You fucked it up!  You fucked it up!  Her life was in our hands!
We're screwed now!  We don't get shit and they're gonna kill her! We're fucked, Walter!
Thaaat's right, Dude.  The beauty of this is its simplicity. If the plan gets too complex something always goes wrong.  If there's one thing I learned in Nam--
Well call them up and explain it to 'em, Walter!  Your plan is so fucking simple, I'm sure they'd fucking understand it!  That's the beauty of it Walter!
What the fuck?
I told that fuck down at the league office-- who's in charge of scheduling?
All right, I'm leaving.  I'm sorry ma'am.
Nihilists!  Jesus.
And let's also not forget--let's not forget, Dude--that keeping wildlife, an amphibious rodent, for uh, domestic, you know, within the city-- that isn't legal either.
Who gives a shit about the fucking marmot!
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Huh?
His million bucks was never in it, man!  There was no money in that briefcase!  He was hoping they'd kill her!  You throw out a ringer for a ringer!
Okay, but how does all this add up to an emergency?
I'm saying, I see what you're getting at, Dude, he kept the money, but my point is, here we are, it's shabbas, the sabbath, which I'm allowed to break only if it's a matter of life and death--
You're fucking Polish Catholic--
You know this!
WALTER, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!  HE'S CRIPPLED!  PUT HIM DOWN!
Hey, cool it Walter.
No Dude.
Shit!
--so, like I say, just thought, you know, fair warning.  Tell Walter.
You told Brandt on the phone, he told me.  So where do I fit in?
Are you employed, sir?
Fuckin' A.
They did not receive the money, you nitwit!  They  did not receive the goddamn money.  HER LIFE WAS IN YOUR HANDS!
Survival.
You're missing the point.  Their vampire victims don't die.  They turn.  They become carriers.  If the Reapers continue unchecked, there could be thousands of them before the month is over.  Do the math.
We're going to be working as a unit, you people will be taking orders from me.  So let's get it over with.  I'll give you a free shot, Reinhardt.
Nothing.
If that's true, then why'd you save me?
Either that or feeding the worms.
Why don't you ask your girlfriend?
Then who does he work for?
Two things.  One, I was on to you the moment they turned you.  And two --  I switched that dud of yours back with the real one.
Well you've got it, warmblood.  Now what the fuck are you gonna do with it?
Yeah, but you fangs can see in the dark. What am I supposed to do?
Thiavolos, as we used to say in Greece. The Devil.  Pure Thirst.  Nothing more. He was born a vampire, but he is an anomaly.  Like you.  Unlike the rest of us, however, he feeds on not just humans, but vampires as well.
Are you insane?  He'll kill us both!
Nobody to call in case of an emergency?
It depends.  We came up with some unusual results on your blood test.
Scud.
Whatever --  What'd you do to the Charger?
You're wasting your time, already been tried.
Blade doesn't talk about the old days much.
Just do it, old man.
Take him.
There are other ways to see. Sit.
You've been here longer than you think.
You're joking --
Because you're tainted. The venom's still inside you. You could still turn on us.
How can you tell?
Like me.
I've been better --
How long have we been driving?
What are you talking about?
For them. But for me --
Fight him --
What about the chemistry panel?
No problem.
He looks different now, burns are less extreme, some of these wounds have closed up --
Someone who's sick of living off scraps. The coming age belongs to us, not the humans!  When the final war between our races comes, who do you want leading the charge?
Habit, mostly, just like this.
I didn't. He was cruel enough to let me live.  Even gave me a souvenir to remember him by.
Try, please, Anna--
I guess--
--a six week bun in the oven--
Then there she blows.
Buried deep under 200 years worth of soil, ash, and compost layers.
--you should get back into bed.
Just now?
Little boys. Looking up my skirt as I danced. Giggling.
Why?
--no one'll ever know.
--no, I think they're all in there.
I don't know yet.
Fine.
Can you zoom it or something, make it real close, real big?
I got a friend at a Lab. I could get the whole thing blown-up, enhanced--
--go!
If you're looking at me, look elsewhere.
--coming out of the water--
--I look and look in the tree, all I ever see, he's always there watching, that stupid owl, over and over--
Fucking owl!
Next time try putting on shoes--
Yeah. Me too.
<u>What</u>--
No one ever comes here.
--shhhh! #5, there's something up there!
What?
--Graduate Thesis--
No problem, just give us 'til dawn and we're gone.
--oh, Jesus--
Motion. Stop there. Play it again.
Sure. I'm sorry.
I think you closed the bar again. I'll have to go out.
Yeah.
Okay. Hypothetically.
Domini.
She's far from "fine."
--fuck Anna!
--the marks appear, then you disappear. Like the little Kurth boy, like Domini, as soon as they come to full bloom--and mine <u>are</u>!
Could I tell him what it's regarding?
His daughter, for God's sake-- I need to know if he's heard from her this morning.
--yes--
See a guy.
What?
Well, I didn't see him anymore, I'll tell you that much.
Except when he doesn't say things they're usually nasty.
...Mm-hmm.
Huh? Oh, yeah, I guess. Mm-hmm.
I don't know. I better get off now.
Abby--
I didn't think I could sleep. I'm surprised you could. Are you all right?
...What was that?
Channels, we got two and six. Two don't come in so hot.
Yeah...
Abby, I like you, but it's no point starting anything now.
Fine. Suit yourself.  ...Having a good time?
Listen, I'm not--this isn't a joke here.
Well what?
What do you think?
I didn't say that. All I said was you're an idiot. Hell, you been thinking about it so much it's driving you simple.
For the money.
...What kind of fish?
So it would seem.
Then you shouldn't have done it. Can't have it both ways.
How would I know?
Where?  ...I'm very careful about that.
Kind of a bleak point of view there, isn't it Marty?
Wasn't too busy. You missed a good one, though. This white guy walks in about one o'clock, asks if we have a discount for alcoholics... I tell him to get lost, but Marty's sitting here listening and I can tell he's thinking that maybe it ain't such a bad idea...
Not here tonight. Wasn't here last night. He's especially not back in his office.
You did? A human ear?
Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
Yeah. I get it.
I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.
Nope. it's new stuff. no smell.
I wanted to see you.
An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.
I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you.
. I saw you come in, talk on the phone. get undressed.
THEN WHAT?
What?
No. What is happening?
O.K.
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from but. I like you.
Take it easy. What's goin' on anyway?. Why are you in so much trouble?
Don?. Are you in with them?
No. I should go.
No. how could he?. Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  . don't hate me.
I'm doing it.
Are you a bad boy?
Yes.
Dorothy. no!
Why are you here?  Hmmmmmmmm!!!! Ok.
What?
My secret lover.
Don?. Where is he?
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
Do you see, Ben?. I can make him do anything I fuckin' please.
Don't look at me, Fuck. I shoot when I see the whites of the eyes.  You like me?.
Yes.
There ya go.
Yeah. What are you doing now?
Maybe so.
Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to you.
I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. a few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?
Well, it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl. I guess you would have a date. that does that.
First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
Okay. yeah, call.
Look. it can wait till Sunday.
Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?
I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
Okay, okay. Bye.
No way. I'm about to blow up.
. OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. this is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. they have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. the ears were for her a warning to stay alive. there is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". you saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
Shoot.
Okay.
Probably not. no. Why?
... Sandy?.
Are you feeling okay?
It's good to see you, Dad.
This is it.
Be right down.
Yeah?
He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.
Thanks a lot, Mom.
Of course, Jeffrey.
Well.
Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?
No. No thank you.
That sounds great!
A toast!  To Mister George Jung.  Mr. I 95, north and south.  My brother-in-law. Happy birthday!
Ha ha.  That's too much, Georgie.  Those days are over.  The rate is one-thousand dollars.  Inflation, you know?
Mama, vos sos bien antigua.  Como lo va a matar con un picahielo.  Eso era en su tiempo, estamos casi ya en los ochenta. El lo va a meter un tiro, lo va a volar, le va a hechar un hijueputa carro encima.
Derek!
Yeah.  I am.
Would you be bummed out if I didn't go to Chicago with you?
George, I went to the doctor.  I don't have two years.
Look, if you really wanna score some dope, I got the guy.
Really.  Are you getting paid, Mr. Jung?
Tell me about the suitcases.  What is the make and the color?
My clothes, your clothes.  What does it matter?
We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop?
Goodness is right.  If you do the math, that's over thirty grand a week profit. I want you to be my partner on this, Derek.  Fifty-fifty.  That's fifteen thousand a week for you, my friend.  In your pocket, free and clear.
Nice doing business with you, George.
Me, too.  Too much blah, blah, blah, blah is no good.  But we are roommates, okay?  And we must talk to each other. I am arrested for stealing cars.  For the grand theft auto.  Okay?  So, now it is your turn.  Now you will tell me, okay?  You will tell me why you are here?
Murder.
Don't worry.  We will talk of everything.  We have the time.  You arrive here with a Bachelor of Marijuana, but you will leave with a Doctorate of Cocaine.
How many kilos can we fit in these planes?
Perfect, George.  Perfect.  Everything is fine down here.  Everything is all set up.
Jesus Christ, Diego, where are you? It's been eleven days and these guys want their fucking money.
Just sell it, Derek.
Weight it.  If it's sixty pounds, it's three.  If it's fifty, it's two-point five.
What do I do with it?  Nothing.  It's for peace of mind.  It's for the principle.
This is not the time, Diego.
You went behind my back and you cut me out.
Okay, Mom.  It's okay.  Where's Dad?
Un rata - no good.  But he could have run, fled the country.  Gone to the policia.  But then his wife, his children, his parents, his friends, many people would die.
Yes.
With all respect, Padrino.  Diego is my partner.  I do not do business without him.
Power?
Keep them coming?  Ah, yes.  Ha ha.  You are right.  But money.
And Diego?
Tough spot.
No, it's good.  You have a family.  It's good if it makes you happy.  It's nice to have nice things.  Are you happy, son?
That was a good one, Dad.  That was really something.  Remember that?
No thanks, fellas.  You've got the wrong fucking guy.  I'm not a rat.
Tuna.
You know how we were wondering what we were going to do for money?  Being how we don't want to get jobs and whatnot? Well, check this out.
Hello.
Out.
Hey, why don't you just put a "I'm doing cocaine" sign on the car.  What is your fucking problem?
I haven't seen one dollar from you.  You haven't paid me one cent in child support, alimony.
Kristina's fine.
Well, I got a call from Pablo.  He said this thing with Diego is a disaster. He's giving up lab locations, names, bank accounts, he was very pissed off. Pablo said to take him down.  His exact words were "Fuck Diego."
Better than you.
What's happening to us?
Nothing.  I just wanted you to know I was out.  I just wanted to see you.
What is it?  A Disneyland thing?
I know, Dad.  I love you too.
Do you see him here in the courtroom?
Yes, I am.
Actually, I've got some news.  That fifty thousand I promised you, I couldn't get it.
So, we need to get to the source.
The law is often inconvenient, colonel ...
Second name.
Third group.
My name is Kader, Ali ... Saari Kader ... In other words, in order to join the organization, you had to undergo a test. I could have told you to murder the barman, but he's an Algerian ... and the police would let you kill him, even though he is one of theirs. By obeying such an order, you still could have been a double agent. And that's why I told you to kill the French policeman: because the French wouldn't have let you do it. If you were with the police you wouldn't have done it.
No. Not you, or any one of us. As long as we are free, the NLF continues to exist in the Casbah. If they manage to take us too, there won't be anything left ... And from nothing comes nothing ...
With the others. They are trying to stop the people.
Why?
Rue de ThÃ¨bes? In the Upper Casbah, I think ...
Yes, I believe there won't be any more talk of the NLF for some time.
Okay, I'll make the statement in writing ...
Yes ... But let me first see you.
It could've happened to anyone.
An inquiry into what?
Cause?
What was Mr. Marsh's physical condition prior to his death?
It would be an added stress to his heart.
You name it -- they argued about it. Mr. Marsh tried his best to keep her happy -- but it seemed that no matter what he did it was never enough for her.
Counsel approach the bench.
Why would she want that?
We're going all the way on this one, Frank.  Tell your client she has until the prelim to cop a plea for murder two -- fifteen to twenty five.
Her.  It's an obvious move.  I'm building a case against her, remember?
A little after eleven.
Tell the court about that, please.
Yes.
How did he look?
Did you talk about Miss Lawson?
No.  She stopped by to pick up some papers.
Show me.
Yes.
Intense.
I had bypass surgery.
She left me.
Well -- I think that after the operation she realized that...
It was like she was trying to push me as far as she could.  She called it opening new doors.
It was like sex was a game to her. She got off on the control.  She always used to tell me it had to be her way.
She was.
Yes -- several times.
She said that she was working on a novel and she wanted to know what kinds of drugs would be harmful to someone with a bad heart.
No.
I was angry.
No -- she asked me about cocaine.
Would you describe for the court what Chinese peony root looks like?
I tell them to pour an amount the size of a quarter into the their hand and mix it with water.
One last question, Doctor.  If someone didn't know better, would it be easy to mistake the peony root for cocaine?
What else did the District Attorney's Office tell you to say?
Yes -- he did.
While I was seeing Dr. Paley I mentioned to him one night that someone was stealing drugs from the third floor dispensary.   Three days after I spoke to him in his office he went to the Head Nurse and told her he had witnessed me stealing drugs.
What happened?
He said that if it kept up she was going to kill him.  That his heart couldn't take it.
You resented the fact that she told you what to do in Mr. Marsh's house?
Well - I'm a little confused.  This is a charge receipt from Rosen's Drug Store where Mr. Marsh had an account.  It's dated the day of the murder.  Is this your signature?
Dristan nasal spray.
Three fifteen.
No.
Sorry.
Yes.
Hi, Frank.
It won't be that hard.
No -- that's what I know you were thinking.
I'm glad you have such confidence in me.
What does that mean?  You've been thinking about the case?  Or you thought everything out before you killed Marsh?
To celebrate how masterfully you destroyed Roston today.
You don't need anybody.
Don't listen to him.  Can't you see he's trying to turn you against me.
Is Mom yelling at you too?
No, Your Honor.
I am relaxing.
Because I go to trial in seven weeks. I've got a lot of preparing to do.
Yeah -- fine.  Excuse me.  I'll be right back.
Where have you been?
You're sleeping with her, aren't you?
Maybe it would be a good idea if you just took Michael.
You think that's the answer?  Sex? Is that what you want?  You want me to make love to you?
No, it's not.  Now I get to pitch.
Doesn't matter. Move on.
No. You can have them.
Well, there's a problem.
Goddamn sonofabitch! I don't want to hear anymore! Sonofabitch! Burn the damn thing! I don't want to hear it! Throw it away!
Well, he just gets on about how if mama ever needed him, she could find him through the National Geographic magazine. He as a photographer. He promises not to write again. Then all it says is...  I love you... Robert.
That he be cremated and his ashes thrown on Roseman Bridge.
I can't believe she never told me? We spoke at least once a week. How could she do that?
No, I don't think so. I --
That's it!
No. We're going to lock this up and --
Oh, don't feel sorry for me. Please. No one's forcing me to stay.
Yeah. But I thought she died.
Was this during Betty?
Everything was during Betty. God we were so young. Why did we think we had to do it all so fast? I've never cheated on Betty. Not once we were married, I mean.
What gets me is I'm 46 years old. I've been in this crummy fucking marriage -
What about me! I feel really weird. Like she cheated on me, not dad. Isn't that sick? I don't mean I wanted to sleep with her or anything but -- ya know -- being the only son. You're sort of made to feel like you're the prince of the kingdom, ya know? And in the back of your mind, you kind of think your mother doesn't need sex anymore because she has you.
They got heat in Michigan.
Heat is heat.
I'll get right on it.
That's it.
That must be it. It's a great smell.
Oh yeah, Bari. I've been there.
No, really?
Oh! You caught me.
No, your kids.
I guess. Except I'm one of the people it frightens.
Yes. Very clean.
I think so.
I feel so embarrassed.
"Making pictures." I like that. You really love what you do, don't you?
I don't know if obsessions have reasons. I think that's why they're obsessions.
Francesca?
Woman friends, too?
Why doesn't it scare you?
Listen, I have to shoot Cedar Bridge until a little after sunset. I want a few night shots. Would you like to come with me? If you're interested...
No. I'll drive myself. I have a few errands. I'll meet you there.
Okay. See you later.
Oh. I guess you got the whole story.
Actually, no. I've got everything under control. I'd like to clean up myself a bit. I'm going to take a bath. Dinner'll be ready in about a half hour.
No. I can't. Not yet.
Why?
No. I couldn't.
What were your parents like?
Well, why is that up to me? You're the one who's married. You told me you have no intention of leaving your husband.
I know you! What can this possibly mean to anyone who doesn't "need" meaning -  "Who goes with the Mystery" -- who pretends he isn't scared to death.
I told you! I won't apologize for who I am.
For anyone. They'll never be able to live through the talk. Richard will never be able to. He doesn't deserve that. He hasn't hurt anyone in his life.
The kids are grown! They don't need you anymore. You told me that. They hardly talk to you.
What about us? What about me?
We are the choices we've made, Robert.
Yes. And I've accepted.
Nah.
Betty.
What happened?
Cremated?!
Alright.  Yes sir.  Anything you say.
"This is the story of Jimmy Bones/Black as night and hard as stones/Gold plated deuce, like the King of Siam/Got his switchblade loose, and a diamond on his hand..." There's the switchblade and there's the diamond.  Don't know where the deuce is parked.
Whatever, let's just get the hellout of here.
Those 'fools' are my people.
Let me see your hand.
One simple word, three little letters. Yes.  That's all it's gonna take and we could move out of this dump, get the real deal.  Big houses, legit business...
Please.  It's for your own good.
But if it's him.  If he's really come back, won't he know us?  Love us?
Sure, if it was really him.  But it isn't that simple.  Jimmy's body died a long time ago.  And his soul is long gone, and all that's left is that ravening, hungry spirit in the blood that soaked into the house itself, I suppose.
Aren't you gonna do something about it?
Fine.  Maybe I got nothing to lose. 'Cept you.
What else does she say?
I'm sure I can make your mother like me. But then do I gotta worry 'bout your father?
Okay, okay.  Listen:
No one'll ever come here.  Shut it down. Don't worry, the bank'll buy it back. I'll take care of it.
You'll take care of it?  Not this time. No way.  I bought it fair and square. And we open tonight.
That's the past.  It's dead.
Dad?
Just a visit with my old pal, Jay-bird.
You better hope not.  Cause it's like they say, four can keep a secret, if three are dead.
No time for eightball.  I got your tip.
Fuckin' comedian.  See you tomorrow.
But --
I was planning on waiting until I got the place cleaned out, but -- like the man says, carpe diem.
Maybe there's a pipe underneath the floor.  It leaked and stained.
I'm not joking boy.  Don't feed it. It'll only make it hungrier.
Evidence of what?
Where is it?
The money!
Jesus, Caesar!
Ummm ...  in the linen closet.
That doesn't make any sense.
So what?!  So fucking what?  Use your head, Violet.  The money is gone.  Gino is coming here to get it.  You think he's going to believe me if I tell him his piss-hole son stole it!  Is that what you think? I don't.  You know what I think?  I think I'm a dead man.  I'm one in the brain.  That's what I think!
But it could be anywhere.
Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.  Maybe you dropped the Scotch by accident. Maybe you didn't.
Shut up, Violet!  This is between me and Johnnie.
For Christ's sake, Johnnie, do what he says.
Caesar, what are you going to do?
Caesar, what are we going to do?
Bullshit, you killed him.  Not me. You did it because you couldn't stand the thought of Johnnie fucking you.
I knew I couldn't trust you.
What are you going to do, V?  Shoot me?  Kill me in cold blood?  I don't think so.  I'll tell you why.  If you had it in you to pull that trigger, you would have done it a long time ago.  If I was you, I would have killed me the minute I brought the money home.  But you didn't and I know why, because you don't want to kill me.  Do you, V?  Do you? No, I know you don't.
Oh, right.
Why?
Oh Christ, the phone ...  That was a fucking stupid thing to do, wasn't it?
Ssh!  I can't hear Gino!
I heard you working in here and I just wondered if you'd like a cup of coffee?
I'm sorry, I usually would call Rajeev, but I didn't know what to do so I called Mr. Bianchinni.
He said you lost something.
A beer?
Because I want to.  I've wanted to since I first saw you in the elevator.
I wanted to apologize.
Shit, here we go.
How can you sit in that bed and say that?
Even though he knew about you?
Yes.
What choice?
How much money?
I didn't say that, but since you did, let's say that you are.  It would have been easy to set Shelly up.  You could have got him killed knowing that Caesar would bring the money to the apartment.
Johnnie?
And Johnnie is his son, that's Johnnie Marzzone?
Gino doesn't know English, or at least he pretends he doesn't, so he doesn't talk much.  He gets right to the point.  Both times they talked for about five minutes, had one drink and then they left.
What did Gino drink?
The plane is in at seven, so I'd say about eight.
When I get the Scotch, how do I know you won't take off?
Because of what you are going to tell him.  You have to make it as real as you can.  The moment you open the door with the Scotch in your hand, you will be covered, and that moment is the most important moment in the plan.
If he runs, everyone will assume he took the money.
You'll be clean and we'll be rich.
If you're this goddamn smart, how did you ever get caught?
I won't.
Listen, if he doesn't run, all you have to do is break down, go to your bedroom and pack some things, start crying, saying you love him but you can't do it.  You're sorry but you have to leave and just walk out.
I'm here, aren't I?
Caesar wants me to stay.
I think everything is okay.
You're asking me a direct question?
Then I'd have to explain Treadstone. And you'd have to explain how you let me get this far.  Doesn't sound like much of a Plan-B, does it?  We'll clean up the field.  You clean up your budgets.
<u>This is an operations desk</u>.
What do you want to do?
I can't call it off.  He's not responding.  Get out of my way.
I work alone.  Like you...  ...we always work alone.
Keep it. 
That'll be their second worst mistake.
It's a lot more stressful than I thought.
<u>Do you have your passport, sir</u>?
Yes, I'm...I'm looking for Mr. Jason Bourne.
Yes, I'm here...
I have some very bad news for you, sir.  I'm terrible sorry to have to tell you this, but Monsieur Kane has passed away almost two weeks ago...
We just picked up a job quite like the one we were bidding for you. Gorgeous boat, hundred-and-seventy- five-foot pleasure cruiser.  I think we learned a few things that might allow us to make our proposal for your job, as I said, a bit more competitive.
Then I'll find another ride.
I don't know.
Amnesia?  You're saying you don't remember anything that happened before two weeks ago?
I don't know.
I thought about it.  I don't know.
Looks familiar?
Nah...  With you, I mean, you'd probably just forget about me, right?
Open it --  -- do it -- what's he got in there?
...this is my picture... he's got my picture --  -- this is me -- this is Zurich -- this...this...this is yesterday --
-- just --
-- we can't stay here -- I can't stay here -- it's not safe here --
-- there's no time --
-- we'll explain it --
-- forget it --
It's a name.  Mr. Wombosi owns a thirty million dollar yacht.  He's the proud owner of an Alliance Security package.  He also paid a visit to the morgue to see John Michael Kane. 
I'm gonna find the end of this.  I can't protect you.
I said, someone came last night --  Look, this isn't a carnival -- people call and they make an appointment and they follow the rules -- everyone signs in and out -- this is a serious place -- serious work -- it's not just to come in whenever you like --
-- what do I? -- I put the name of the person I came to see? --
My husband's out looking for him.
That old beast?  Miss his breakfast? Not a chance.  It's always something, right?
So now you're asking for a student visa?
What do they have on the streets? The area.  They must have something.
Hang on... 
What's that?
Abbott wants to talk.
-- we're in the middle of a trade meeting! --
Where am I?
You we're lost at sea.  They pulled you out.  Who are you?  You were shot -- two bullets -- in the back.  You understand me?  Who are you?
Thank you.
I haven't got an emergency. Get out of here.
I fixed it myself.
You're putting your talents to very odd use Mr Lowry - yes, odd use - to pit wits against Central Services -
... yer ducts.
What? How do you know my name?
Well not exactly. But, if you help us we'll help you. The Forces Of Darkness have won the day ... but, tomorrow is another one
Yes, it was ... very nice ... thank you.
Well ... well, I ...
Well, since you disappeared up the ladder of Information Retrieval ... I don't expect to see you slumming in Records - what's the problem?
Problem? - No problem - yes, everything's going fantastically well, wonderful, marvelous, great career prospects, Alison in great shape, kids fine, beautiful home, I'm on Security Level Five now, and Mr Helpmann relies on me more and more, yes, couldn't be better, I feel terrifically motivated and job- rewarded -
You sound worried.
Really? - God, how time flies!
What?
I've got numbers all over these - I'm not sure which is the one you want.
You clever bastard! I might have guessed. You only moved in today and you're already hot on the bloody trail.
Please, Sam, we're going to have to be open to each other on this one. If you make a reputation with this case, it'll be at my expense.
How do you mean?
How much do you know?
You killed him?
He's a freelance subversive?
Look after that suit, eh. Barbara chose it for me.
Get her out of circulation - I've put her on the detention list.
What does that mean? I don't want to be involved in anything unsavoury.
Say it was a mistake.
Er ... alright. For Christ's sake don't lose it. Here, you'd better sign for it.
Tell that to the wives of the Security men she blew up this afternoon. Listen, we've also had a report just in from Central Services that Tuttle has wrecked an entire flat and sabotaged adjacent Central Services systems - as a matter of fact, in your block. I'd keep my eyes open if I were you, Sam. Bye.
How could you do this to me?
No, there's no stamp on it. You see! I can't give you the form until it's stamped.
How can I act naturally, when you've trying to break my arm?
No.
Why are they all pigs at Information Retrieval?
I didn't run away. I left the flat.
What does it look like ... I'm collecting empties.
A heavy Christmas present.
How many terrorists have you met? Actual terrorists?
Will you please turn back.
There are plenty of other safe places. Why don't we go back to my flat?
You've got to trust me. It sounds silly but I know we were meant to meet.
Oh my God, a mistake!
Oh, good!
I've told you before. I'd turn it down.
Really.
I've tried that! Population Census have got him down as dormanted, the Central Collective Storehouse computer has got him down as deleted, and the Information Retrieval have got him down as inoperative ... Security has him down as excised., Admin have him down as completed
Try next of kin.
Call the motor pool and authorise personal transport.
I delivered it.
Can I forget it?
Yes.
I know that.
Yes ... No ... I don't, know.
Ah.  Would you mind if I borrowed your computer console?
By the way, I saw a wonderful idea for Christmas presents at the chemists. Gift tokens. Medical gift tokens.
Is Mr Helpmann here?
Not now ... please
Um ...
I don't know which numero.
Madam ... CUT to WOMAN turning, half in flirtatious conversation. It is SAM's MOTHER, but miraculously another twenty years younger and ... a parody of SAM's Dream Girl.
Central Services.
Not ... as such ...
It's a 27B/6, what did you think it was?
Sorry. wouldn't it be easier just to work for Central Services?
The paperwork, couldn't stand the paperwork.  Over to the left please, if you don't mind sir. Hold it there. Yes, there's more bits of paper in Central Services than bits of pipe - read this, fill in that, hand in the other - listen, this old system of yours could be on fire and I couldn't even turn on the kitchen tap without filling in a 27B/6.... Bloody paperwork.
Why? I came into this game for adventure - go anywhere, travel light, get in, get out, wherever there's trouble, a man alone. Now they've got the whole country sectioned of and you can't move without a form. I'm the last of a breed. Ah ha! Found it!  There's your problem.
I'll fire you tomorrow. Hell, better than that, I'll forward you some sick time. A week, two weeks off-- how about that?
You can trust me on this one.
Sleeping in the back.
Mary, we really have to go.
I should be going. I just quit.
I can't wait all night, Young. I'm holding a priority and if you don't answer I'm going to knock you out of service.
What's his name?
I can't. I have to stay with my patient.
What?
Go home. Take her home. Get some rest. Not going to find anything out now.
Did you see my father?
Okay.
You sure? I know my father would hate to be tied down. He wouldn't even go to the dentist.
They're fine. My old man was a bus driver, mom a nurse--I was sort of born to it, I guess.
I better go check on my father. Thanks for the pizza. I owe you one. Maybe when he gets better, you know, when we're done with all this.
Nothing's going to happen. I'll come with you.
Promise you won't go inside.
It'll be a while before he's up and running again.
I wish these people would leave already. I can't listen to another story. Did you see him?  That doctor says the brain is coming around. They're waiting for the heart to stabilize. I don't know who to believe. He says they still have to keep him tied up.
Can I bring you something back to eat--a falafal, some pizza?
Come on up.
You ever notice people who see shit always, are crazy?
I'm hungry too. We gotta get some food after this.
She's no whore, Marcus.
She wasn't looking at you, man, she was looking at me.
That's too many.
You can't leave me now.
No, that's Noel. Used to be a regular off and on, hasn't been in in a while. He seized and almost coded--I gave him a hypertonic solution. He drank so much the kidneys were taking out salt. One for the textbooks.
Don't worry, kid. Tom'll take care of you. Put your head out the window, get some of that summer air. Listen to the music. El Toro de Oro. Andale. Pronto.
I've taken that into consideration.
What's the reason? Give me a reason, Tom.
If he sees me, he'll run, so I'll get out here. You start talking to him about baseball or something while I sneak around behind and get down and you push him. When he falls we get him.
Frank!
I eat. I just haven't had coffee yet.
You see, he's giving it to us anyway.
Nice, Jane.
I'm not buying into any of that.  I have a load to learn.  I'm not going to act as if...
I made one rule for myself when this started and I realized I was going to take a lot from you people because of being from sports...
We're conversing...Oh my, the names of the entire Cabinet has slipped my mind.  What are they?
Sit on it!  <u>Now</u> look.
The pointers were great.  I'll study the tape.
Yes.  And I'm sorry that they're sending you down for a while, but you'll make it back...Where they sending you?
London.
Can I ask you something?  You only had one crew on the date rape piece, right?
Why?
I don't like the word gay.
Okay, I'll see you in the lobbies [<i>sic</i>].
This conversation is not worthy of you.
I'd give anything if that were true.
Good night.
Last time Paul was sick they gave Connie the weekend news instead of me.
Watch? --
Right and we have the '81 pilot on the way in -- Nobody else will have him.
I figured out exactly why it is I'm so hung up on getting a chance at weekend anchor...It's because if I do that well, they'll pay me more, treat me great and my life will be better.  That's why.
Sounds like you may be on to something.
Good.
Yes...I was thinking that way too... Which tie?
Yes.
I'm not sure I'll be able to...I...
Do others feel that you did well?
Stop kidding.  I want to know what happened.
I'm not kidding.
Yes, I guess.  Yes.
No.  You know that I'm not.
I'll be walking with my wife and two children -- we'll bump into you on the street, my youngest son will say something and I'll tell him...  ...it's not nice to make fun of single, fat ladies.
Really?
In front of a little -- it's a bit... You want a mirror?
I'll put him in the low corner of the frame -- good.
I'm gonna go look at it again.
Stop it.
Just blunt talk, okay?  I'd really appreciate bluntness.
They told me they'd keep me because they could plug me into any story and my salary was in line.
No.
Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuckes.  Snot... Fuckee.  You want to use that?
Uh-uh.  I'm a little freaked right now about seeing my father though.
Thanks.  I just wish you'd kept the first twenty seconds.
I'll never tell.
Yes?
No.  I'm doing fine...Look.
Well, who knows.  Just let m tell you what my favorite teacher ever, told me -- 'Don't be afraid to be wonderful.'
Tell me I'm on the way in.
It's Paul.
They fired me.
You don't have to finish tonight.
Oh my.  I see you studying so hard, Tom.  What do you think the problem is?
Fill for a second.
Thank you.  They hated me.  I don't hate them.
Totally understood.  Totally wrong of me to talk shop after the day you've had.  Totally sorry.
I trust you.
I thought you were incredible in there. I know how much I have to learn.  I'd really -- a lot -- appreciate it...if...
Well, thumps like me leave appearance to guys like you.
Yes.  Just don't say anything mean for a while.  Thanks.
There's no gang in there -- We were the last ones.
Eventually.  Does it have to be right now?
If I tell you, can you manage not to put it down or tell me why it won't work or is in bad journalistic taste or anything like that?
Yes, Tom -- I think I can manage.
Good.  That's it...See you.
Not if you count 'Singing in the Rain.'  Do him a favor and don't treat it like a tragedy.  You want me to talk to him?
You fucking...
Jesus, if you're glib about this I'm going to lose it.  I was up all night and...
Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane...
You keep coming after me and looking down on me.  It's starting to make me batty.
I knew what you meant.
What I don't know, I can learn and what I know, nobody can teach. Excuse me for saying it about myself, but I think it's true.  What do you think?  Never mind what you think.
Well, we should talk.  You going to have time for  dinner?  I'd like you to meet Lila.
Boy, that's nice...I wish we could all deal with each other like this. I'll check it.  Anything I can do for you?
This is my first time at the White House. Is there any chance to look at where he works and the rest of it?
I just might.
Uh-huh.
When's the last time you had a totally nude girl in your room...
Anything new?
You know it.  I'm out of here.
Honest?
What's it called?
Thank you.
Carla -
Walter, I'm sorry...
What?
There's...a body inside that statue!
I hope this was made with egg whites!
What's this sauce!  I'm lactose intolerant.
I'm honored to know this man.
Leonard, what are you doing?
Well, it all depends, Leonard...
I know, man.
I saw a statue once called The Third Time Phyllis Saw Me She Exploded.
Let's check out the scene.
Right.  Ain't no body of work complete without some... nudes -
Well I was uh, just looking...
Sure!
Enough already about it - get to work!
Well make a dog, make a parakeet! I'm sure you'll think of something.
What, Mr. De Santis?
You made...a bust... WALTER  Yeah isn't it wonderful?
Well, w-what did you do?
I'm trying to reach Lieutenant Beldere...
Yes, you have.  Can I come in?
Yeah I did.
Oh, yeah.  It can get real expensive.
You are?
Don't give me a hard time Walter! You don't want to get me mad!  You're coming with me!
Turn around!
NO! NO DON'T SHOOT ME I DON'T WANT TO GET SHOT!
Good morning Walter!
No thanks.  Sounds good though.
Let me into your world Walter... let me into that white hot inspired world.
Then let me give you something then...
I had him in my grasp.
Oh, yeah.  But I still want to know what happens.
No offense, man, but I think you're on something nasty.  Why don't you just go and cool out and I'll see you in the morning or something.
Get away from here.
Guys.  Guys!  Reality pulled out of her five minutes ago.
I just want to see the basketball scores.  It's important.
Well, stay here tonight.
I know.
You got that right.  I thought you wanted to kill vampires.
I don't want to kill anybody, and I don't want to talk about it anymore.
I should have known.
Get away from me!
Bogutude.  Blow it off.
Why don't we see a movie?
'Just remember you're in training, son'
I've searched the entire world for you, Buffy.
Did you ever dream that you were someone else?
Lothos.
It's true.
A Vampire-King?  You mean like Dracula?
Oh, him.
Great.  First I have a birthright, now I've got a fate.  Hey, do I have to take notes on this?
Yes, yes.  It would be interesting. A nice cheer.
Who we gonna beat?
I don't want to be the chosen one, okay?  I don't want to spend the rest of my life chasing after vampires!  I just want to graduate from high school, go to Europe, marry Charlie Sheen and die.  It may not sound too exciting to a sconehead like you, but I think it's swell.  And then you come along...  and... and then I'm a member of the hairy mole club, so you throw things at me!
Put your head back.
No... I guess I would have gotten Jeffrey to hit you.
If I say 'no' does that make me a bad person?
Try to pay attention.
And the alley was a mistake.  Never corner yourself like that.  If they'd come at you in force you'd be dead now.  One vampire is a lot easier to kill then ten.
You felt a little sick, didn't you? The cramps.
Five.
I'm curious, is all.
Vampires of the world, beware.
But it's in the back.  Why are we wasting time with this, anyway?
Another distraction.  It's not right.
Why because it's not my fate?  It's not in the Book-of-All- Knowledgefullness that I'm gonna be cheerleading at the Barber game?
How do you not tread on the earth? I mean, you kind of have to.
Really?
Could be.
Okay.
Nee sitch.  No way.
Hey, wait a minute...
Okay!  Look, Buffy.  You want to play house with the unwashed masses, that's fine.  But personally, I think you ought to spend a little time prioritizing.  I really do.
You should think about leaving, too, man.  Sell this place... Something's going on here.  I don't know.  Something real weird.
I am.
There is a lot of things you never thought of, sweetie--now get some rest for tonight's game.
Big League pitchers don't use these.
Sorry.  You look great.  I'm totally exhausted.
There are two important psychic conduits called the "pingala" and the "ida".  The pingala starts with the left testicle  and ends at the right nostril.
Oh don't be silly.  Death is nothing to be scared of.  It's just another way of living.  It's just a fresh start--kinda like spring training.
No.
No, that's okay.  All I need's a little nap.
You can't seduce me.
I'm not gonna try to seduce you, sweetie...
Well--he calls it the Bermuda Triangle.  He said a man can get lost in there and never be heard from again.
What'd he say?
I'll be back when we lose.
Oh--won't YOU come in?
Annie Savoy.  Wanta dance?
I'm ready for a complicated man.
--and as soon as we lose a game, he'll be back in your arms.
What's so great about baseball?
It's possible.
Are you gonna be waking up next to 20 year old ballplayers when you're 60?
Why not?
It doesn't work like that.  God, you're gorgeous.  Want to dance?
Ninety-five miles an hour...
Oh let's not...
Jesus, what kinda broad are you?
Shh, shh...  "They will not let me off till I go with them, respond to them, and discorrupt them and charge them"
Yes.  A switch hitting witch. Very common in Puerto Rico.
Did you call me a cocksucker?
No!  I said It was a cock-sucking call and you can't run me for that!
You're close, Crash, you want me to run you?  I'll run you!
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
Now, Nuke, would I do a thing like that?  Hey kids, this is the great Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh.
I wanta throw the heater to announce my presence with authority.
By the dozen.  Holiday on Ice, Ice Capades, Ice Follies--  I'm through with one night stands.
Can't you let me enjoy the moment?
What do I gotta do?
Let go of me!
You're a great catcher.
No way.
Ain't he warning up?
Look at that. Look at this. There's nothin'... look how many blueberries your muffin has and how many mine has. Yours is falling apart. I have nothing.
That's right.
Why would they want to find out? We're puttin' a hundred million into this desert here. Why would they want to lock us out?  And besides, they'll never find out. All you gotta do is keep changing your job title. Like, uh, from Casino Executive to Food and Beverage Chairman. And what happens it, they take your application, they put it at the bottom of the pile. I know guys workin' there for thirty years, don't have a license.
All right, look, if he took a break, it would just give everybody some time to maneuver. That's all I'm saying. It's all that I'm saying.
The worst was Blue.
Congratulations.
You do? Yeah? Well, if you ever come back again... ever... to take her money... next time bring a pistol. That way you got a chance. Be a man, don't be a fuckin' pimp. Now, you want to do me a favor? Get out of here. I want to be alone with my wife. Get the fuck up and get out of here.
Yeah, is this Lester? This is Sam...
She's not here, Sam.
Uh, I'm not. Sam, I wouldn't...
So, once she signs those papers, she'll be the only person to have total access to the box?  No one else, including myself?
I can't! I'm tied!
I don't know.
I don't know.
You know, I don't know if I could do this even if I wanted to. The Gaming Commission would never give me a license. I have at least two dozen gambling and bookmaking pinches on me.
He bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon.
Yeah.
So, I'm lucky. I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place?
What? Ho-  Hey, come here.
All right.
I gotta do somethin'. I gotta do somethin'. They ain't gettin' rid of me. They're not gettin' rid of me. I'm staying here. Fuck 'em. Fuck 'em.
Yeah, forget about your fuckin' license. I plant my own flag out here, you ain't gonna need a fuckin' license.  You know, I don't know what it is, Sammy, but the more I talk to you, the more I feel like you just don't wanna go along with me, is that it?
You should say so.
Now, what does she have to do with all this?
I - I would appreciate it if you'd stay out of my personal life, okay? You wouldn't like it if I did it to you.
...to me.
I knew what he wanted, and I didn't want any part of it.
Fuckin' walking around with a big head. You better check yourself...
Nicky wanted to take over. He wanted to go after Gaggi, go after the skim, go after everything and everybody.
You're makin' a big fuckin' spectacle of yourself.
Get this through your head, you Jew motherfucker, you. You only exist out here because of me!  That's the only reason!  Without me, you, personally, every fuckin' wiseguy skell [Skell: the lowest form of wiseguy - a drunken bum] around'll take a piece of your fuckin' Jew ass! Then where you gonna go?!  You're fuckin' warned! Don't ever go over my fuckin' head again! You motherfucker, you!
Yeah.
She was afraid to call you.
I don't know. What am I gonna do with this woman? I don't know...  She's drivin' me fuckin' crazy.
Believe me, if I could prove it, he would be under arrest.
I'm sorry, I can't do anything. He's too incompetent. And the bottom line is, he cannot be trusted.
Well, it's a little too early. I'd say Thursday would be good. I'll know by then. Is that all right?
I'll come by.
I-I'm sorry, Sam.
Well, sir, I was just...
That's right. She will get fired. In fact, I want you to send her back to Paris.
The little guy. He's half in the bag, and nobody told him he was eighty- sixed from the joint, so we...
Yeah, Bill, listen, I'll explain to you later. Just - You - You got a gun at home? Yeah. Bring it over here right away.
But mostly...
I'm forty-three years old. I don't want to wait. I know you well enough to know that I really love you very much.  And I can't think of anybody better to be with. And I don't feel like waiting anymore.
Yeah, I know all that.
So, I put two million in cash in a Los Angeles bank under the name of Mr and Mrs Tom Collins. This was strictly my shakedown and kidnapping money.
...they didn't know what really moved her.
Yeah.
Good, so then you could tell me what the money is for.
...routine calls, they have to click off after a few minutes.
...please. That's all I'm askin' you.
Do you... I mean... I don't think she should go by herself.
How serious?
All right...
Yeah.
Would you knock it off, Sam?
Let go of me! Let go of me!
I'm going to the bank and I'm getting my jewelry too!
And don't send your guys down there to stop me! I mean it.
I am. I'm wakin' her up right now.
What did Jennifer have?
Okay. I want you to call Jennifer and I want you to tell her to tell you what she had for lunch, and I'm gonna listen in on the other line.
What if he won't stop?
Fuck you.
You'll wake the whole neighborhood!
Let me in the house! Fucker!
I do understand that. I'll get right on it. And thank you.
I really think you're -
I really think you're overreacting in this whole -
You're firin' me?
Well, I... I never tried.
Yeah.
Thank you.
We're not gonna go see any fuckin' elephants, okay?
Shut your mouth!
Hi. Good.
Please.
And here. Here.
Pitch-black?! It -
Turned out to be one of the other coaches was a fuckin'...
But I'm just trying to leave.
Yeah. Everybody's talkin' about it. They're makin' a big deal out of it.
Yeah, I know. That's why I'm asking. You see, my main concern is Nicky.
Hm.
I want to know... if he's doin' all right. If he's okay.
I'm askin' you, Frankie, to keep an eye on Nicky. Do it for me.
You see... I wouldn't want to be jeopardizing anything for people who are our friends. You understand?
Definitely the most important guy in this room.
You mean, like a lot of expensive jewelry? About how much?
It's all right.
Oh, you're right, I know.  It's... well, I was just -
What? What?
Yeah?
You know?
Yes, you did.
I'm not and he scares the shit out of me. I never know what he's gonna do.
Is that what you want?
If it's so fuckin' dangerous, then why don't you kill him?
Hey, don't be such a fuckin' smartass, will you?  I mean, I know the fuckin' guy thirty-five years, I'm gonna fuckin' whack him for you?  Fuck... motherfucker! I knew this, I knew it.
You fucked with me for the last time!
Well, you know...
Don't give me that shit. I want my money.
Get lost?
Yes.
Where are you goin'? Where are you? You're in that place. Where are you?
Promise?
Uh, talk to you later.  Bye. 
We're going to Europe. Let the adults talk.  You dye your hair... you get plastic surgery, like we talked about. Right? You're the mother. How much do you think he's gonna pay to get this fuckin' kid back?
Here.
Ginger... It means he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, waiting for me to call him back. Now, I -
Go! Go! Get in the car! Go!
Listen...
Are they out now?
All right.
I think that's it.
Incredible.
Get up.
Every night, on the couch.
Remo.
Let 'em complain. I'm the one who's here.
Fuck you, you motherfuck!
Charlie M? You make me pop your fuckin' eye out of your head to protect that piece of shit? Charlie M? You dumb motherfucker!
Kill me, you fuck, kill me.
Kill you,  You motherfucker you!  Frankie, do him a fuckin' favor.
How you doin'?
Denying?
I didn't curse. I said 'frickin' head'.
All right, take it easy now, take it easy.
Mom, I'm sorry, they're beatin' me left and right.  Ma, I'm sorry. I'm all upset.
Then do it the way you want.
Guilty. I am.
I'll bet the butler's name wasn't "Jeff."
I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...Would you like to go to dinner? I know; a tame suggestion considering the wide variety of miniature golf possibilities available to the Oasisburg citizen--but nevertheless, would you?
I'm not afraid. Are you?
Hey, hey, the client comes first. You think I want my future children to know their Daddy created Frank's Fun Palace?
So, did you see "Seinfeld" last week? That Kramer-guy really makes me laugh.
Exactly. I don't know what I'd do without you.
She has a real spirit.
Oh, you don't have to explain to me where you're going...
It may be time to get the police involved...
I've been looking for you.  Selina Kyle was right. One of us is a psychotic crusader.
But then we knew that all along, didn't we...
Priceless...We have a showdown in this alley, right?
The "skylight?" Fool!  It's too high for anybody to climb out the damn skylight...
What did you say?
Absolutely.
I'll put that in the report--after you shoot her.
I know.
It's a lot more fun than fighting violence with pamphlets. That voicebox of yours is a hoot. Say "I'm wearing no underwear"--it'll be funny..  You do know you're evil, don't you?
You can't get away with..
Spear.
Hello, Rachel. I'm Selina.
What's the good news?
What if I were to say "You're Fired?"
Enough.
You turned around!
What?
Okay. Let's get serious. Of course I know the Cult of Good is not good. Ever since I saw what they did in Atlanta, it has been my mission to expose them. I've followed them to Oasisburg and soon will have enough hard evidence to bring them to real justice. That computer disc could be the final piece to the puzzle. This isn't just a story, Selina--another damn Pulitzer--this is my life.
What if I say I'll go out with you, so you can have all these great daydreams, but then never actually talk to you again?
I never thanked you..the arrow..the motorcycle..the computer disc..You're so different from what I..and so the same.
Yes, I'm pretty amazing. You should see this...It came this evening.
I don't know if I can do it alone.
Where do you think you're going?
Matter of fact I did have a kid once.  But he's a lot better off with his father in Milwaukee.
I'll explain later.  I'm sort of on hold.
Did you have to tell her my name?
You got it wrong.  I'm the one that's on your side.
Only I was sloppy.  I let you take me out.  That was quite a humiliation.
You never miss a trick.
Bullshit.
And stop with the directions.
Satisfied, Wiseass?
I was worried about you.  Both of you.
Will you let me explain!
You may be our only chance.  I don't know if I can do this again.
They smashed the phone.  I've been clicking the loose wires together hoping it'd make a connection.
I have no idea.  They put us in the back of a van with blacked out windows.  The shutters up here are nailed shut.
Listen, there's an overpass coming up.  I may lose you for a minute.
Rachel, my daughter.  She's an honor student at Parker.  My God, she's only nine.
Even if I got there first she wouldn't go with me.
She would if she heard my voice on the phone.
Just hang on.  I've got a life of my own.
And that was the end of it?
The City National on San Vincente.
I'm cutting across to Bundy to Brentwood.  That bank is our best bet.  If anybody shows up I could follow them.
Jack will negotiate with them. He'll identify the right key and give them the information they need to gain access and they'll let Rachel go.
Do you know what's in that box?
I might still get there first. The lights are with me.  How would I identify the guy who shows up at the bank?
Don't panic.  I might be wrong.  Hello?  I guess I was wrong.
They dragged me downstairs.  I thought they were going to kill me.
She's awake but she hasn't spoken. I don't know what they did to her. I don't want to think about it.
You're all three of you in that van?
Why can't it be her?
You're going to let them get away with this?
And all that crap about your driver being murdered by a cop --
I thought it was inspired.
I guess I ought to stop seeing woman as victims.
Did you hear that?
Dial him up.  We need him to run interference.
The money, Nels ... ?
Think you could do a picture of me?
As a child I hated being told how sweet I looked.  That angelic little face wasn't me at all.  I had to hurt people to prove to them they had the wrong image. Sometimes words were enough -- but I wasn't beyond inflicting physical pain in order to be taken seriously.  I enjoyed seeing the shock on their poor faces when they realized who I was.  That same look you gave me when I turned the gun on you.
He might've heard everything we said in the car.
Maybe your friends already accomplished that chore for us.
-- The phones, Theo.  Don't leave any of them behind.  The cops could pull up a record of all our calls and -- find you.
Pass.
What time frame have you got in mind?
You're getting a lot of mileage out of that cellular.
I wish it had never been invented.
It's your call.
I still don't see you.
We're waiting for the light to cross the highway.  It just changed.  We're in a grey van.  It reads "<u>Noble Carpet Cleaners</u>."
Then just wait.  I'm counting this all out and deducting my share. While I'm at it you can be getting that tape off the lady.  And her little girl.
I make my end of the cash at 184,000.  Now I'm trying to figure out the bonds.  What the face value is.
You'll still have the girl and the husband.
What are you planning to do when they got here?  They'll kill us. They'll kill Rachel.
Sure, I end up with some cash. And a lot of bonds I don't know how to dispose of.
That bitch.  What's keeping you from taking off?
You could always disappear with what's already in your backpack.
Believe me.  They couldn't be busier at the moment.
I've got a couple of spare pieces stashed under the floorboards.
Them.  They won't be expecting us.
Only you <u>don't</u> have a flat.
If you weren't going for a spare what were you doing?
From here on, I dish it out.
I'm sorry.
Stop it, Dil --
Saw it, Dil.
Fuck it, is what I say.
C'mon, babe! You know what I like... Easy!
You heard me --
It's him, isn't it?
Fuck off back to Essex!
Whatever it is she does for you.
Guy I work with.
No.
Jimmy?
Not me.
What was that all about?
Like what?
How special?
Yes.
The thing is, can you go the distance?
No...
Where?
What you doing here?
Give it over, Dil --
Do you care, Jimmy?
You mean that?
That's a start.
Probably.
Kind of wish I didn't.
Should have stayed a girl.
Okay. Be a good girl and go inside.
Not at all, honey.
Not here.
You following me?
What's her?
I'm sorry, you know that? I'm really sorry.
Afraid so.
No. Sit down.
You'd like me better that way, Jimmy?
Yes.
You promise?
I'm sorry.
You mean that?
You didn't.
Okay.
More what?
Jimmy, is it? Do you know me, Jimmy?
All right, then. I like to be wise.
He ran. I couldn't shoot him in the back. I tried to catch him. He made it to the road and got hit by a Saracen.
So you did fuck up.
We've got some plans here. And we'll need a Mister Nobody to execute them.
Jesus, Fergus, you're a walking cliche. You know we won't leave her out of this. But I'm glad to see you care.
Do you want a cup of tea?
Because tomorrow we might have to shoot him, that's why.
Who'd you think it was?
And you know what'll happen if you fuck up again, don't you?
Good. So what do you think?
Can't.
You're the one about five ten with the killer smile and the baby face.
Am I?
My pleasure.
You're going to have to do it, aren't you?
No, what's the funny thing?
What?
Absolutely not.
Suppose you could say that.
I got sent.
And you play cricket?.
Ever see hurling?
Best game in the world.
My pleasure, Jody
Means what it says. The scorpion does what is in his nature. Take off the hood, man.
Like what?
Do you?
Take her picture. C'mere.
Like the one about the frog?
Yeah?
What does that mean?
Cause you're my friend. And I want you to go to the Metro --
Cricket's in the halfpenny place.
People. They could be looking.
To the apartment -- it matches mine perfectly.
No, it's all right. What's wrong, Adam?
Well -- it was a place -- a street corner, I think. But I don't --  Hold it. I'm on.
It's Thursday today -- and it's almost five -- come on!
I'm not Dyle -- you know that!
I'm through listening to you!
Don't be a fool! He's Carson Dyle!
Here, give it to me.
No thanks.
You mean spies and things like that?
Mr. Bartholomew -- if you're trying to frighten me you're doing a really first-rate job! 
Oh, you've got the money all right -- you just don't know you've got it.
Mr. Bartholomew -- if I had a quarter of a million dollars, believe me, I'd know it.
Describe him.
Carson?
Yes. The five men. They were, of course, your husband, Charles, the three men who showed up at his funeral yesterday, and Carson Dyle. But something went wrong and they were unable to locate their contact. It must have been at that point that they decided to steal the money.
But if they stole all that money -- why can't you arrest them?
I told them what you said -- about this man being Carson Dyle's brother. I asked them what they knew about it and they told me -- you're not gonna like this, Mrs. Lampert -- they told me Carson Dyle has no brother.
The last one, please.
Around one.
Quit stalling -- I want to see some identification -- now!
Open it.
Your --
Serious. When a man gets to be my age that's the last word he ever wants to hear. I don't want to be serious -- and I especially don't want you to be.
Okay -- I'll tell you what -- we'll just sit around all day long being frivolous -- how about that?
That sounds like their problem.
Lord, I forgot all about it -- Sylvie works late Tuesday nights -- she always leaves him with me. They wouldn't do anything to a little boy, would they?
Or Tex?
Maybe.
Yes, I know.
Did you ever hear the story of the boy who cried wolf?
The shower's in there.
Are you trying to say that I might have killed Charles and Scobie?
I can't very well leave without a pair of water wings.
After I graduated college I was all set to go into my father business. Umbrella frames -- that's what he made. It was a sensible business, I suppose, but I didn't have the sense to be interested in anything sensible.
The man who bought them last week was American. I did not see him but I heard. I knew you would come.
The money is unimportant.
In money.
The best for the last -- le chef- d'oeuvre de la collection. The masterpiece. It is the most valuable stamp in the world. It is called 'The Gazette Guyanne.' It was printed by hand on colored paper in 1852 and marked with the initials of the printer.  Today it has a value of $100,000.  Eh, bien -- I am not a thief. I knew there was some mistake. Take them.
You gave the boy quite a lot of stamps in return, Monsieur FÃ©lix -- are they for sale now?
No. The police have kindly provided us with a list.
You know I'd tell you if I had it.
Dead, Mrs. Lampert -- like last week's news -- like Charles, Mrs. Lampert --
She isn't going to be anybody's mother unless you answer some questions.
Leave?
Your husband possessed a ticket of passage on the 'Maranguape.' It sailed from Bordeaux for Maracaibo this morning at seven.
He was a wealthy man?
About how wealthy would you say?
Where did he keep his money?
I don't know.
It is all right.
I don't know. Perhaps he met somebody.
Obviously.  One ticket of passage to South America -- one letter, stamped but unsealed, addressed to you --
And this? And this?
What should we give him?
The one you're blocking. This is the last chance I have -- I'm flying back to Paris this afternoon. What's your name?
Peter Joshua.
No, it isn't. I'm getting a divorce.
Well, you're honest, anyway.
Oh. I guess.
It's terrible -- you just made it up.
Are you in the book?
I'm sorry -- I heard the children laughing.
Starting tonight?
I wasn't --
Look, I know it's asking you to stretch your imagination, but can't you pretend for a moment that I'm a woman and that you're a --
How would you like a punch in the nose? Stop treating me like a child.
Please help me, Peter -- you're the only one I can trust.
Don't put yourself out.
Come on now -- sure you do. An' you'd better give it to me, Miz Lampert -- cuz I ain't foolin'. No sireebob!
Don't make too much noise, Miz Lampert --
I don't know.  But if this is a sample of American diplomacy I'm buying a fallout shelter.
Hello, Reggie -- I am waiting for Jean-Louis.
Don't be un-neighborly-like, Herman -- don't forget he done us a little ol' favor.
Then he gets it out of your share, not mine! Not mine!
You do?
ARE YOU THE KILLER BEN?
Dad ! Most of my friends can stay out until 11 on school nights and 1 on weekends!
Daddy, are you upset that I'm still a virgin?!
I am. I'm so very proud of you. Go back to sleep.
Nothing. I just picked up the phone to say goodbye to you. You didn't say goodbye.
Ok. Goodbye. Now get back to school.
Run!
No. I'll handle this.
Two kids were found mutilated in the woods. Lock the door after me.
I'm looking for Lisa Sherman.
She resides there. Out back. She died a year and a half ago.
She was murdered?
No, you couldn't.
No. Hell, it's the quietest goddamn party I've ever seen.
What?
I was grounded for two fucking months because of you!
Can you just follow me? The back is full?
Then you should go.
I was born nine months after she was raped. One of the four men who raped her is my father. I have no idea which one.
You watch. There's going to be a hymen holocaust tomorrow. Maybe I'll finally talk to Mark Shale.
NO?!
Unless he makes a move during seventh period.
Didn't you have something a little more romantic in mind for your first time?
Stag?
Fuck your curfew. Most sixth graders can stay out later than you.
No I'm really grounded. When I got in late the other night, my father was waiting up for me.
I do not.
You flaunt some slut in my face.
Pretend we're just another couple.
Yes?
I overheard daddy mentioning her to someone. I he thinks she's the killer.
The library. I'll be fine.
Who is she?
What?
I'm not leaving. I want to know why you and dad are so freaked out. Three of my classmates are dead.
I've regretted it ever since. Never run with the herd just because they're the herd.
So are you.
No.
I'm not leaving it here.
Okay, okay.
INT. POSTAL VAN - DAY.
Look, you need me to sign an invoice or somethin'?
Hey, you and I are seein' eye to eye on a whole range of issues this mornin'. 
Hang on.  Hang on.
...and a shitload of ice.
...think he was a wacko.  And I think that G.I. ninja's a bigger wacko.  And I think you're the biggest wack-...
You want cash?
I got, uh....
Would you hurry up, please?
What did you do that for?  It makes him mean as a snake.
I ain't goin' through Missoula!
Borrowed.
You stole this truck.
That's...
Ah, one of them's in the back.
No, no, no, no, no.  Keep goin'.

Don't gimme that "nice job" shit, man! They still got a vanload comin', and what do you got besides an empty...
...I'm not the psycho.
You wanna hit me?
It was owed to me.  You stole the damn...
Hey!  Hey!  Andy's Ice Cream.
...up!

Your weedkiller on steroids goes down with us!  Everybody  dies!
That's right.  Now,  move!
 Okay.
Go, go, go, go, go.  Oh, shit.
Come on.
What are you talkin' about?!  I'm the one drivin'!


Come on.
Okay.
These'll keep it cold.
Yeah...
All right, let's go.
Okay.  All right.  Okay. 
Hey, put it back!  We're takin' off.
Then stay...
...here!
Okay.  Okay.
Oh, shit!

Hey, you didn't happen to lock the truck up when you got out...
...-tion?
It won't even start half the time.
...or nephew or some good old boy...
Never gonna throw a ball in the pros.
And  things sort of just went downhill from there.
Anyway, about ten months ago, I wound up in Jerome, workin' for Darlene.
Not completely, anyway.
...-er.  It was your friend...
...shit.
...miles.
Hey.   Mason.
Yeah.

Oh.


Arlo!




...our ass!
He's comin' up fast!
 There's gotta be...
Hold this. 
Sorry.
Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey.  We are heroes, my man.  It's time to start actin' like it.
Always the negative...
Arlo, nobody's gonna believe us.
Oh, oh!
Be cool.  Be--
...within five minutes.
...without compunction.
Wait.  This town is full of trucks.  Nice new trucks.  You don't need to go...
...here.   Mason... 
...-lem too?
...the guy the Army guys are lookin' for!
Thank you.
Exactly.

What the hell is all this about a detonation today?  We're scheduled...
Now listen to me.
Grateful?
And I certainly can't say it's pleasant.
Or I may be wrong.  The breeze could be gusting south.  That'd be Billings...
...Destry, Fair Oaks....
INT. LONG'S CAR - NIGHT.
INT. BRYNNER'S VAN - DAY.
INT. ICE CREAM TRUCK/CAB - DAY.
And so Missoula's prodigal son returns.
...-ther orders?
I wanna patch in from...
What about these two?
We're gonna use them for demonstration  footage.
...in Missoula.  All we need to do is get to Mason before anyone else does.
Carl, Dennis, get out of sight.
...to pursue a man who's stolen government proper-...
...screwup?
Where's their protective...
...gear?
...out here, captain.  Don't you think the guys deserve a break?
....-lene.
Actually, I was just looking for a restroom.
I assume you have one.
Elvis is fuckin' dead, man.  Get yourself some CDs.


You'd never understand!
...and then my night man shows up when he feels like...
Oh, you're two of a kind, doc.  Oh, he may not have your sheepskins, and...
INT. U.S. RESEARCH LABORATORY/CORRIDOR - NIGHT.
EXT. DAM - DAY.
INT. POSTAL VAN - DAY.
All right, let's move...
Pappas, that other guy was unloading ice cream into a freezer.  Now, what could he have to do with a military scientist, huh?
Run a check.  FBI, Interpol.
Hey, doc.  Might wanna...
Excellent.
 No, that's not possible, Mason.  The trout... 
...is a perfect hunter.
He's brains without ambition...
Tie a fly...
Some people might say you're readin' an awful lot in-...
...fishin'.
Some people might.
Tryin' to remember somethin' somebody once told me about tyin' a fly.
Mr. Sweeney, how goes it?
Yeah, yeah...
Yeah.
You find yourself wearing a...
You know, I gotta tell you.  That really bothers me, somebody calls me "son."

His name's Vitelli.  Talk to him.  He's right out-...
...we're all gonna die in this...
Just go check the temperature.
Fol-...

INT. ICE CREAM TRUCK/CAB - DAY. 
BLACK BACKGROUND.
INT. VITELLI'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
INT. TUNNEL - DAY.
If that's what it says.
Well, then, how about a ruler?
I think I gave it to her.
Oh yes.
Are you sleeping with her? Come, come, Mr. Gittes. You don't have to think about that to remember, do you?
Mainly that you're rich and too respectable to want your name in the papers.
Maybe.
I've got her.
And that's what you were going to do in the Valley?
I want to know what you're worth. Over ten million?
Thanks, Mr. Gittes.
Call me Jake. How is everything?
In the garage.
You sure this is okay?
I've been wanting to meet you.
I'm not.
Not anymore. Oh, some time ago, my late husband owned a good deal of beach property in Long Beach, but we lost it.
Thank you...
The apple core?
No. The albacore. It's a fish. My grandson's a member and they take very nice care of us.
Well, sometimes it takes a while for a man to find himself and I guess you have.
Gee, Lou, I'm doing the best I can.
Let her go. She didn't kill anybody.
Gittes, stay outta this.
No.
May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?
You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.
Well, that little girlfriend, she was attractive in a cheap sort of way of course.  She's disappeared. Maybe they disappeared together somewhere.
It's very personal. It couldn't be more personal. Is this a business or an obsession with you?
It wasn't much of a lie.
He told you?
Did he know?
You mean you don't know where you were?
I don't see anyone for very long, Mr. Gittes.  It's difficult for me. Now I think you know all you need to about me. I didn't want publicity. I didn't want to go into any of this, then or now. Is this all?
No reason.
I don't believe you.
Maybe putting your nose in other people's business?
Yes, of course. It was quite a while after. I was just out of grade school when they did that.
Then it was over the water department.
Yes. He never forgave him for it.
No.
What do you mean, 'why?' Nobody's here, that's all.
Just. I don't know why. I'm asking.
What were you doing there?
Could you do anything about it?
Just... I have to.
Where are you going?
Please!... Trust me this much...  I'll be back. Look, there is something I should tell you. The fishing club that old lady mentioned, the pieces off the flag.
It has to do with my father.
I know.
This morning.
Yes.
I will if you don't.
...That's not what I meant.
She's my sister and my daughter!
That's worse... Just get out of here. Walk out, leave everything.
Okay...
Three reservoirs. Men's room of a Richfield gas station on Flower, and the Pig 'n Whistle.
Oh yeah? You pick up the watch?
When did you come in?
...Why don't you give me your address and we can talk this over?
A Miss Sessions calling.
Okay.
Just, if you will, confine yourself to the main building. It's nearly bedtime.
I wonder if you'd care to wait in my office?
I cut myself shaving.
I never was.
Yeah, a little runoff. Where are those orchards?
Well, tell you what, pal. If Ida wants to see me she can call me at my office.
I am sorry.
...Yes of course.
But...
That's swell. But how about here?  Ever worked for Robert Knox, Emma Dill, Clarence Speer, Marian Parsons, or Jasper Lamar Crabb?
Yes. No.
He did or he didn't?
Yes.
He owned the entire water supply for the city?
I don't want Mulvihill.  I want the big boys that are making the payoffs.
Gimme your keys. Watch this old fart, will you?  Take Duffy's car. Curly's boat's in Pedro, near the Starkist cannery. It's the Evening Star. He'll be waiting. I'll take care of this.
Mortgage Department, First National Bank.
Of course I knew your father. He was tall, thin, pleasant, and had a moustache like mine. Always smiling. He looked like Clark Gable.
Because I don't want to, Toto! This is not a job for you. It's like being a slave. You're always alone. You see the same film over and over again, because you have nothing else to do. And you start talking to Greta Garbo and Tyrone Power like a nut! You work on holidays, on Christmas, on Easter. Only on Good Friday are you free. But if they hadn't put Jesus Christ on a cross...You'd work Good Fridays too!
No...
With time...you get used to it. Besides, when you hear from up here that there's a full house and that people are laughing, having fun... Then you're happy too.  So I've been wasting my breath? You pretend to agree with me, but as soon as my back is turned, you do what you want!  Get out of here! I don't want to lay eyes on you again! This is the last straw! Your mother's right, you're crazy!!  But how'd he do it? The little bastard! By watching, he's learned! It's incredible!  I'm letting the box office know you're not to set foot even into the theatre! There are no more tickets for you! And I'm also talking to Father Adelfio! You won't be an altar boy any more either!!! You little runt! 
No! You mean right at the end?  ALFREDO That's right, Toto, right at the end? And don't ask me what it means. If you figure it out, let me know...
I'm here! Take it easy! Take it easy!  Sit down, sit down...  Did she come?
They tell me you never go out, never talk to anybody. Why?
Who said that? Gary Cooper, James Stewart, Henry Fonda? Huh? 
Yeah!...Getting there's downhill and all the saints help you. But coming back! The saints stand there watching you, that's all! God's will be done.
For what?
You shouldn't tell me that now. After all these years!  I put all your things in here. Go in, go in...
Thais.
I can't take shorthand.
Look at that.
Sit down, everybody - for heaven's sake!
That's right.  They called us the "Three Musketeers."
That Rosebud?  Maybe some girl?  There were a lot of them back in the early days, and -
Sure, sure.
Nobody else, but I've been through that stuff of Walter Thatcher's. That journal of his -
It's not trick to make an awful lot of money if all you want is to make a lot of money.  Thatcher!
It didn't end very well, did it?
It ended -  Then there was Susie - that ended, too.  I guess he didn't make her very happy -  You know, I was thinking - that Rosebud you're trying to find out about -
Yes -
In case you'd like to know, Mr. Bernstein, he's at the Huntington Memorial Hospital on 180th Street.
Who said anything about brooms?
Certainly not.
Certainly not.
I wanted him to have fun - and with me along -
Yes.
September the ninth?
Not to me.  But you will let that cop go home with Mr. Kane, won't you?
How do you do, Mr. Leland?
Are they standing for me?
How do you do, Mr. Bernstein?
But a morning newspaper, Mr. Kane. After all, we're practically closed twelve hours a day - except for the business offices -
Is it good?
I made Miss - Miss Alexander send you the note.  She was a little unwilling at first -  but she did it.
Emily -
There aren't any personal lives for people like us.  He made that very clear to me nine years ago - If I'd thought of my life with Charles as a personal life, I'd have left him then -
I know that, Emily -
Charles.
Emily - you musn't leave me now - you can't do that to me.
It may not be about anything at all.
I'm going to -  - 185 West 74th Street.
You decided what you were going to do, Charles - some time ago.  You can't always have it your own way, regardless of anything else that may have happened.  Come on, Charles.
If you want to come in and wash your face -  I can get you some hot water to get that dirt off your trousers -
Would you sing for me?
Half past eleven.
Yes.  The bulldog's just gone to press.
It's not a habit.  I do it because I like it.
What you want me to want, you mean. What you've decided I ought to have - what you'd want if you were me. But you've never given me anything that -
Oh, I don't mean the things you've given me - that don't mean anything to you.  What's the difference between giving me a bracelet or giving somebody else a hundred thousand dollars for a statue you're going to keep crated up and never look at?  It's only money.  It doesn't mean anything. You're not really giving anything that belongs to you, that you care about.
Susan, I want you to stop this. And right now!
Mrs. Kane, I'm not asking you to believe me.  I'd like to show you -
Get out!  I've got nothing to talk to you about.  If you want to see me, have the Warden write me a letter.
Can you prove it isn't?
On the other hand -  I am the publisher of the Enquirer. As such, it is my duty - I'll let you in on a little secret, it is also my pleasure - to see to it that decent, hard-working people of this city are not robbed blind by a group of money- mad pirates because, God help them, they have no one to look after their interests!  I'll let you in on another little secret, Mr. Thatcher.  I think I'm the man to do it.  You see, I have money and property -
Mrs. Kane liked poetry -
- and that copy of the "Enquirer" said the President should be killed.
Charlie!
That's just a little promotion scheme. Nobody expects you -  Mike, will you try and get Mr. Leland some coffee?
Yes.  Now, will you let me go to Chicago?
I can remember everything.  That's my curse, young man.  It's the greatest curse that's ever been inflicted on the human race.  Memory -  I was his oldest friend.  As far as I was concerned, he behaved like swine.  Maybe I wasnt' his friend.  If I wasn't, he never had one.  Maybe I was what nowadays you call a stooge -
It's a letter from her lawyers.
Rawlston is my boss.
Oh, yes.  I know about Mr. Rawlston.
I am in receipt of your favor of yesterday.  I beg you to do me the courtesy of accepting my assurance that Mrs. Whitehall cannot be induced to contribute any more information on the career of Charles Foster Kane. She has authorized me to state on previous occasions that she regards their brief marriage as a distateful episode in her life that she prefers to forget.  With assurances of the highest esteem -
Yes.
I guess maybe I'm not as hard to see through as I think.  Anyway, I never even answered his letter. Maybe I should have.  I guess he was pretty lonely down there those last years.  He hadn't finished it when she left him - he never finished it - he never finished anything.  Of course, he built it for her -
That must have been love.
On your way out, stop at a cigar store, will you, and send me up a couple of cigars?
The Bank's decision in all matters concerning his education, his place of residence and similar subjects will be final. 
All we saw on that screen was a big American -
Yeah.  I guess he wasn't very happy those last years - he didn't have much reason to be -
See what I mean?  He was a little gone in the head - the last couple of years, anyway - but I knew how to handle him.  That "Rosebud" - that don't mean anything.  I heard him say it. He just said "Rosebud" and then he dropped that glass ball and it broke on the floor.  He didn't say anything about that, so I knew he was dead - He said all kind of things I couldn't make out.  But I knew how to take care of him.
He married you, didn't he?
Monday, with some of the boys from the office.  Mr. Rawlston wants the whole place photographed carefully - all that art stuff.  We run a picture magazine, you know -
I'll have a highball.
You think I'm shitting you...
You've made a wise choice. Keep up the good work.
Can I join in?
Wow. Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. You eat Chinese, right?
You're very protective of him, Randal. You always have been.
Territoriality. He was mine first.
I want to talk to you about something, and I don't want to be disturbed.
Was I right?
But you were.
Give me a bit more credit. I think it's time we got back together, you know. I'm more mature, you're more mature, you're finishing college, I'm already in the job market...
The key word here is talk, Dante. I think the idea, the conception of us dating is more idyllic than what actually happens when we date.
Sang.
I'm just kidding.
No.
Um... I don't know.  What time did hockey end?
We did.
We're sorry, ma'am. We got a little carried away.
If you grab a Gatorade, then everybody's going to grab one.
Bunch of savages in this town.
What smells like shoe polish?
I wanted to use your car.
You win.
Allan Harris.
Return of the Jedi.
The Emperor.
Hence, the Empire was a fascist theocracy, and the rebel forces were therefore battling religious persecution.
More or less.
Compliments of Lando Calrissian.
He said he has to find a perfect dozen.
Perfect dozen.
He's the guy in those nudie-booth joints who cleans up after each guy that jerks off.
Nudie booth. You've never been in a nudie booth?
Think of the weirdest, craziest shit you'd like to see chicks do.  These chicks do it all. They insert things into any opening in their body... any opening.  He's led a very sheltered life.
Can we talk about this later?
You gotta loosen up, my friend. You'd feel a hell of a lot better if you'd rip into the occasional customer.
Liar! Tell me there aren't customers that annoy the piss out of you on a daily basis.
Which ones?
All of them.
FUCK!
That seems to be the leitmotif in your life; ever backing down.
Don't yell at me, pal.
Shit. What about tomorrow?
You hardly knew her!
I'm not taking you to this funeral.
I'm going with you.
He broke his neck trying to suck his own dick.
I was just leaning on it! It was an accident!
So the casket fell over! Big deal!
What?
Two reasons: one, I hate when the people can't shut up about the stupid tabloid headlines.
Jesus!
Really?
I'm not. She just left.
I'm not.
Yeah, you should shit or get off the pot.
You're comfortable. This is a life of convenience for you, and any attempt to change it would shatter the pathetic microcosm you've fashioned for yourself.
Oh, like your life's any better?
It's the same thing with Veronica.
You date Veronica because she's low maintenance and because it's convenient. Meanwhile, all you ever do is talk about Caitlin. You carry a torch for a girl you dated in high school-in high school for God's sake! You're twenty-two!
Jesus.
Helluva day.
You remember Alyssa Jones? She hung out with...
Yep. I remember you got caught in my parents' room with Caitlin once.
THE GLADES MOTEL?
Yeah?
No, she's getting married.
While you two were dating in high school. We're talking four, five years ago, back when I drove a Trans- Am.
How many times I gotta tell you not to deal outside the store.
Probably saw that Caitlin chick. I know I felt like beatin' it when I saw her.  Come here, bitch! You like this? Is this what you want? Hunhh?
You used to go out with her?
Damn. She sure goes out of her way.
She's my girlfriend.
No; he was probably just resting his eyes.
Don't hurt yourself. I'm going to Big Choice Video instead.
No, I mean the ones there. Behind the counter.
Yeah. I like the cartoons. They make me laugh. They draw the biggest titties.
Why don't you open the shutters and get some sunlight in here?
Who's defensive?  Just... Would you just hug me?! All right? Your boyfriend was accosted by an angry mob, and he needs to be hugged.
Women? Women, as lovers, are all basically the same: they just have to be there.
Making a male climax is not all that challenging: insert somewhere close and preferably moist; thrust; repeat.
A girl makes a guy cum, it's standard. A guy makes a girl cum, it's talent.
Why'd you hit me?
They put up the least amount of struggle.
I want you to come with me on Monday.
I'm sorry, Dante. I thought you understood.
How many?
HOW MANY?
All right! Shut up a second and I'll tell you! Jesus! I didn't freak like this when you told me how many girls you fucked.
What the hell is that anyway, "something like thirty-six?" Does that include me?
Every time I kiss you now I'm going to taste thirty-six other guys.
Thirty-seven. I just can't...
I had to tell someone. He put it into perspective.
What did he say?
At least he wasn't thirty-six.
Thank you for being rational.
Thank you for the lasagne.
Eight. But I have a sorority meeting till nine, so I'll be back before you close. Can we go out and get some coffee?
Sure.
Would you let me explain...
Veronica... I... it's not like that anymore... I mean, it was never really like that...
Yes.  I'm not out of shape.
Excuse me, but have you been here all day?
Can I have your name please?
According to the NJAC-the New Jersey Administrative Code, section eighteen, five, slash twelve point five-a fine of no less than two hundred and fifty dollars is to be leveled against any person reported selling cigarettes to a minor.
Scumbag. What are you doing?
Does he sing in English or Russian?
I do about three-fifty, four.
Feel that.
I only pointed out that you weren't paying any attention to what I was saying.
I'm not sad.
After all that I've done for that fuck! And he wants to be with that slut? Fine! He can have his slut!
I'm going to have a word with that asshole.
Do you still talk to Sylvan?
What?
Exactly, cheesehead, exactly.
Hal will have my head for this.
WHEN SHE'S SAFE!
Hey, fuck you.
Can't pass up another chance to play hero, can you.
You don't know anything. You did it your way and she died.
Hi, Gabe.
Okay--I don't know about this.
I'm here!  Sarah, I'm here!  I'm here--I've got you!
You're not gonna die.  Grab me with your other hand!
Wait, I think I have them sighted.  What's the word, Frank?
You can stop right there.
A lot of things fell apart up there.
I don't think you do.
I can't blame anything on Hal. It was me.  I play it back in my mind everyday.
Excuse me?
Did I miss something?
Y'know, yelling at this altitude can lead to hyperventilation and fainting--
No, I think I will, it's safer. I have patience.
Where's Hal, what's going on?
Don't worry about me, just go.
Can you think of something more romantic than attacked?
This rope is sixty years old!
Never, what?!
There's no "we".  There's a me. All I have to do is make it along the north wall to Bitker Ladder. What you're doing is going back down to the station to get help. And don't put on that mad face.
Oh, good. For a minute I thought you'd lost your mind.
Are you crazy?  Has the altitude shrunk your brain, Gabe?
Forget it!  I refuse!
There's a lot more where that came from.  You're not leaving again?
Good memory.  You must be great with numbers.
The best he can since you gave him nothing.
What are you talking about?
Anyone else following?
Where's the rest of the team?
Do you always transport through the air?
What the hell are you waiting for, goddammit!  Don't you see what he's doing!  He's hijacking the shipment!
Were.  Give me the tracking monitor!
Kill him when he gets down.
What about it?
We're down to a few hours before the whole world shows up here.  Where's the next one?
Matheson has been transferred from the Denver office to Frisco. As a professional courtesy between offices, I was asked if he could hitch a ride.
You're the boss.  Let's head out to the tarmac.  Matheson, have you been totally briefed?
I haven't lost a bill in eighteen years, don't jinx me, Walt.
Of course. Food alright?
Thank you, sir.
Your wife, sir? Has she gone away?
She was very badly raped, you see. We were assaulted by a gang of vicious young hooligans in this house, in this very room you're sitting in now. I was left a helpless cripple. The doctors said it was Pneumonia, because it happened some months later during the 'flu epidemic. The doctors told me it was Pneumonia, but I knew what it was. A victim of the modern age, poor, poor girl. Suddenly his mood changes. He wheels right up to Alex.
I'm frightfully sorry. There is a telephone in the Public House about a mile down the road. I suggest you use that.
Our brief govereet thru the letter hole was not, shall we say, satisfactory, yes?
Fine, sir, fine.
Well, shall we get down to it?
Hullo love, how are you?  Nice to see you, Dad.
Oh, or certainly by this evening, yes? The evening's a great time, isn't it, Alex boy?
What gets into you all? We study the problem. We've been studying it for damn well near a century, yes, but we get no further with our studies. You've got a good home here, good loving parents, you've got not too bad of a brain. Is it some devil that crawls inside of you?
It's alright, thank you.
Oh well, it's... it's not all music you see, Missus. It's just the 9th.
That's right. Er... I can't listen to the 9th any more at all. When I hear the 9th, I get like this funny feeling.
Appy polly loggies. I had something of a pain in the gulliver so had to sleep. I was not awakened when I gave orders for awakening.
Let's hope you make the most of it, my boy.
We always help our friends, don't we?  It is no secret that the Government has lost a lot of popularity because of you, my boy. There are some that think that at the next election we shall be out. The press has chosen to take a very unfavourable view of what we tried to do.
Mmmm, possibly. Yes. But public opinion has a way of changing and you, Alex, if I may call you, Alex?
Thank you, Fred. Thank you. Minister turns and signals. Door opens and a crowd of cameramen and reporters rush in. Aides push two 6-foot loudspeakers and a Hi-Fi on a trolley.
Keeping fit then?
Well - I'm back.
Well, still the same old place then, eh?
Oh well, he met with like an accident. He passed away. Alex becomes a bit weepy.
What's gonna happen to me then? I mean that's my room he's in - there's no denying that. This is my home also. What suggestions have you, my Pee and Em, to make?
No, brother. What d'you want?
What do I want?
You want to know why I did that, well you see - I do that... He stamps on Alex's foot.
Yes, sir, Church of England, sir.
Brown hair, is it?
No, sir.
Shut your bleedin' hole!!!
Something like that. You are a little undernourished, so after each meal were going to give you a shot. Roll over on your right side please, loosen your pyjama pants and pull them half-way down. He does, somewhat reluctantly. She gives him a shot in the bum.
You mean, I have to viddy two sessions in one day?
What are we going to do? Talk about me sex life?
Ohhh... jolly good. Perhaps you can explain me something to me first.
Patients who've sustained the kind of injuries you have often have dreams of this sort. It's all part of the recovery process.
Jamey Mack! Be the hokey fly! Holy Mother of God! All the Holy Angels and blessed saints in Heaven preserve us. Alex breaks away but the Tramp toddles alongside him.
You certainly have not, 655321. You've been very helpful, and you've shown a genuine desire to reform.
Father - may I ask you a question in private?
These things get around, Father. Two Warders talk as it might be, and somebody can't help overhearing what they say. Then somebody picks up a scrap of newspaper in the workshops and the newspaper tells all about it. How about putting me in for this new treatment, Father?
Have you been receiving medical treatment for any serious illness?
Very good, Chief. Chief Guard turns to Alex.
You are to be reformed. Tomorrow you go to this man, Brodsky. You wbe leaving here. You will be transferred to the Ludovico Medical Facility. It is believed that you will be able to leave State custody in a little over a fortnight. I suppose that prospect pleases you?
Not a chance, my dear fellow. The Ggovernment can't be concerned any longer with outmoded penological theories. Soon we may be needing all of out prison space for political offenders. Common criminals like these are best dealt with on a purely curative basis. Kill the criminal reflex that's all. Full implementation in a year's time. Punishment means nothing to them, you can see that... they enjoy their so-called punishment. Alex seizes his chance as they pass by.
Sixth is faster.
No?  How many cabbies get you into an argument to save you money?
Most of the time.
I was heading back to my garage.  It's on the way.
I'm...fine.  Fine.
Did better'n that.
Most vividly.  "St. Louis Blues," "Potato Head Blues," "Sleepy Time Down South..."  ...then Pops laid some "Cornet Chop Suey" on me, and left me in the dust like a whipped dog.
Then let's have it.
Sorry?
I think...  ...I think you should get this gun out of my fucking face.
Federal?
Twenty five?
So?
I don't know...
Ivan Petrov.  Supposed to meet me for dinner, never shows up.  I come here, find this.
Months now.  He's been feeding me information on Dmitri.
...if they're wrong?!
Tell me about it.
You couldn't pick up a phone?  I'm lying here, wondering if something horrible happened...
Yo, whassup?
I was just tryin' to...to...
Maaaaaax!
We're gay lovers, what's it to you?
<u>So?</u> Aside from I hate talking to cops, they tell me you crashed the shit out of it.
I see your point.
Yeah.  I share it with the dayshift guy.
Two, two-fifty.
Max.
You always stutter?
I don't think I can do this.
His hand moved!  His goddamn hand twitched!
I'm trying...
Yes!  I'm trying, I swear!
Try harder.  I'm gonna count to three. One...
Adrenaline's wearing off.  You get shaky after.  It's not uncommon.  Deep breathing helps.
What'd he do to you?
I can't believe this.
Why?
Collateral damage.
Leave me alone.
She hears what she wants to hear, okay?
Yeah?  What happened?
I've always been good.  Ever since I started.  Gave up piano.  Easy money. I'm putting a stake together, get something started.  Go figure it all out...
See, I've got bills.  My mother's been dying of the same disease since I was a kid.
What, no insurance?
We've both run out of options.  If it helps, take comfort in knowing you never had a choice.
You get benefits?
Tribeca, near the waterfront, northeast corner.  Twelve minutes.
Who's Heller?
That's the "why."  That's the why? There is no reason.  No good reason; no bad reason.  To live or to die.
...all the cabbies in LA, I pull Max, the man with X-ray vision...
None of your business.
Let her go.
Love?  Love's just a pretty way of saying, 'I want to sleep with you'.  Love is bullshit.
Geronimo?
I love her so bad.  She just... wrecks me.  I would die for her.
Why the hell not?
Drop me off here!
I think you're different.
Yes!  Don't let's get into this thing where I have to repeat myself!
I got to get downstairs.  The C.I.A., they want to see your body.
Really?
Right.  Sit up so I can see you.
Them who?
What is it with you and the space program?
You wouldn't be sitting here if you didn't halfway believe me.
I've been reading up on it.
How'd he die?
What van?
Never mind.  You'd think I was making it up.
Maybe you better not try... I worked so hard to keep quiet. Like a mouse.  I should have realized.
I would never hurt you, Liza. Think whatever you want, but don't think that.
I thought you -- Why -- Love ruins everything, doesn't it?
There's a car following us. Probably another one flanking us the next street over.
Reagan didn't die.  If he had died, everybody would know what Johnny's middle name was.
Your father, he was dying.  He was worried about you.  He took your picture out to look at it.  He called you his baby.
Jerry...?  <u>Jerry</u>.
I spent two years here.  This used to bring the med-cart.  Demerol. Phenobarb.  It's Jacob's Ladder.
It's up.  Love gives you wings. You can fly away from here.
Now she tells me.
It seemed like a possibility. What about your intentions?  Are they honorable?
I'm not a violent man, Mr. Lowry. Not by nature, anyhow.  But if you hurt Liza in any way, I'll kill you.  Does that seem honorable?
M.K. ULTRA was terminated in 1973. But not the research. It was renamed.  EX CATCHER.
As in <u>Catcher in the Rye</u>?
Me?  I was a minor missionary, a heretic really.  But where else could a red-blooded American boy lie, cheat, steal and kill with the sanction and blessings of the All-Highs?  Besides, now I'm trying to pay my penance.
Agent Lowry?
I don't know if you're the best lawyer I've got or a high school sophomore.
He's shown himself.  Why haven't you arrested him or killed him or done whatever it is you do?
All the elements are there.  A woman, orphaned young, under a great deal of stress.  The failure of a project she's staked her self-worth and very sense of identity on -- induces a fantasy of reuniting with her 'father in heaven' as it were. Is it possible?
I'm not.  You're far too promising a scientist to waste your considerable gifts on this nonsense --
Ellie...
Then why haven't you detected any signals?  If, as you claim, there have been thousands, millions of advanced civilizations out there for millions of years then why hasn't one signal gotten through?  It'll take a month or two for the paperwork to go through; you're welcome to stay until then.
It was a worthy experiment -- worthy of you; I was wrong about that part. But it's over now.
It's hardly yesterday; the signal's been traveling for over twenty-six years.  As for why...  I'm hoping your own expertise in decryption algorithms will help us find out -- to see if there's another message buried deeper in the signal.
Do you have a minute -- ?
As of three o'clock this afternoon. I submitted my resignation.
What would you have me say, David?
How soon will you be able to decode it?
In ancient times when parchment was in short supply people would write over old writing... it was called a palimpsest.
I don't know.  Maybe there is a fourth layer in there somewhere, but if there is, I sure as hell can't find it.
Been there, done that, got the T-shirt.
It can't be coming from Vega, the system's too young.
It's incredibly rich.  We've been cataloging it in frames or 'pages'; right now we're on 10,413.
You don't seem to understand that it's your interests I'm trying to protect -- !
And a hundred mile airspace.
That's terrific, but there's one problem:  we don't have the means to receive all the data on our own.
I don't have an official response, Michael.  All I have are the same questions you have.
Is it possible.  Yes.  But --
Am I artifact or dream?  You might ask that about anything.
And those other docking ports I saw... I mean... there are others?
And they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built.
You always have been.  We're all descendants of the same stars, Ellie.  All made of the same primordial atoms.
That isn't the way it works.
No more stalling, Captain.
No.  Please.
I didn't realize I was out.
It's so... small.
I think whoever sent the message did it because they're worried about us.
-- of Hadden Industries.
It's beautiful but it does get a little lonely.  Sometimes I think the reason we build these things in such godforsaken places isn't to avoid excess radio traffic but because we're all such pathetic antisocial misfits... Speaking of which:  How're you getting on with the old man?
Please, you're just as ambitious as I am, more --
Peter, what are you talking about? What malfunction?  What day is this?
What day?
'My father's house has many mansions.'
That's not doubt.  That's four hundred years of science fighting a billion years of instinct.  I always wondered what you religious types did with your free time.
Prove it.
Not exactly.  It has organic qualities, but we don't really understand how they're integrated with the mechanical systems.
You're willing to die for this.
Losing Faith:  The Search For Meaning In the Age of Reason. Catchy.
It's getting late...
Oh.  I brought you something.
Thank you.
I do seem to be... Maybe because I'm just a little bit terrified about tomorrow.
I'm sorry.
What are you so afraid of?
Don't you understand?  I just have to hold it together -- just until tomorrow --
Ellie, there is no reason you have to be alone.
I'm not sure it's come to that.
I do.
I want to, Palmer -- more than anything.  But it has to be real. It has to be true.
Call it xenophobic paranoia.  Don't you see the absolute absurdity of this?  This isn't about them, it's about us -- our violence, our fear and mistrust --
Dr. Arroway, you are entitled to your opinion.  But we feel quite strongly that it would by both irresponsible and naive to send a human being into a completely unknown, completely uncontrollable situation absolutely defenseless.
But --
Git your shovel and git to work.
No it hain't, Luke. You ain't alone. Ever whar you go, I'm with you, and so's John.
We allus thought you was strong enough to carry it. Was we wrong?
No.
Gotta go, Arletta.
He's probably a gigolo.
-- went down to see this old hag and she had needles the size of that cane.
'Bout two hours left.
I'm dyin'. I'm dyin'.
I didn't say nothin', Boss.
A Lucas Jackson.
I just always did like truck rides.
That's what you're gonna have to do.
The man wants speed, let's give it to him. Ram it in and break it off. Go hard. Shag it.
That's it. That's the end.
What you talkin' about, Luke? We're together, you and me, just like always. Now the thing we gotta work out is how to get Koko outa there and then the Terrible Trio be all complete again. Man, this old Free World ain't gonna know which ear to stand on.
You ever see mah boy throw up? Shut your mouth and put up your money!
Dear Boys. Playing it cool. Wish you were here. Love, Cool Hand Luke.
Gettin' up, Carr.
Cuter.
Ace calls. Here we go.  King-five gets a tray for no help.  Paira ninas gets a Jack.  Ana man with the ace gets... slop in the face... Ninas up.
A phoney? Whatta you mean, a phoney?
This is a big day for the guards. They get to remind us who's boss.
Okay.  You win.  'Dirty Harry' coming up.
No, dear.  You're at your best with a bag in front of your face.
Reminded me that I used to be attractive.  That men used to want me...
About what?
Look out for her.  She's tougher than you think.
I'm okay.  I really kind of enjoyed it.
Shut up -- I'm talking.  You got felony breaking and entering, burglary, felonious...
No, that's still in my jacket I was wearing.  We were supposed to meet on the docks, that number 47 wharf, 10 o'clock Friday.  He's gonna hand me 500 bucks.
You break into her apartment to deliver a gift?  Where is it?
Ah ha.  What did he want?
Listen, you want my advice?  Steer clear.  He's writing me he's gonna finish 'my unfinished symphony.' He's gonna give me $550 for some of my cum, he says he's in a position to see that I will be immortal if he has some of my spunk.  I'm offended.  Right away I smell <u>freak</u>.  Writin' about him and me and <u>you</u> bein' joined and he's gonna finish my <u>symphony</u>?  I didn't care for his drift.  I sent some liquid soap in a sandwich baggie with a message from Jesus to mend his ways.  You hear I found Jesus?  And what's funny is, now I don't mind bein' inside.  If I was out, even Born Again, I'd probably get restless again.  It's maybe better I stay here, what do you think?
I think whatever is best for you, Daryll.  And maybe you're right, that's the place.
Oh, I think you will.
How do you know that?
Look at the sign.  'Hell'?  In the Festival of Love?  You make any sense in that?
Because I'm his damned pin-up girl! His, all of them!  They know me. They're in prisons with libraries, they collect clippings, I'm their worthy opponent.  You keep my name out of this.
He's going home.  He slept over because I was a little anxious...
Injected Windex!  Why would he switch to a new m.o.?
You're afraid of him.
I did not; the Mouth -- that's what we call Susan Schiffer -- got it on her own.
A man?  I thought he was a boy.  This last Christmas was the happiest Christmas I had in the last ten years... you know why?  It was the first Christmas in six years I was not in love.  Son of a bitch <u>married men</u>!  Who cares about marriage, the bed just gets crowded and noisy?!
Oh, shut up, and don't be so damn self righteous.
Not yet.
What else?
She is a writer, writing best selling books about serial killing. Giving lectures she's well-paid for.  Her interests are not the interests of law enforcement.
No.  I didn't.
Not what I meant; why <u>me</u>?
You know, M.J., when I watch you shoot, I realize I've got a little problem with my stance... could you just move over here and critique my legs?
Classy madonna.
Sure.  She likes <u>you</u>, Rube.  She likes the way you move.  She sure as hell isn't in love with me.
Spread out like she was sexually assaulted here.
Don't try to lie, Ruben.  You don't have the face for it.  I need you to help interrogate the burglar in Hudson's place...
This is the anniversary of the summer of love and your city fathers have declared a Festival of Love.  The Mayor and Chamber of Commerce don't want TV announcing killers on the loose.
I'm checking out anybody who lives like DeSalvo.  Records of arrests for rape, especially by a man wearing green.  Checking out psychiatric hospitals for his personality profile.  Cross check- ing names from arrests for sexual offenses, public fondling.  If they've got a German wife.  We can keep cops working on this kind of junk for years, and this guy's going to hit again, soon.
I know.  Get out here.
How'd you get in on the deal?
You have no authority to make a deal like that.  That' s for the D.A...
...confirm this third murder adds up to a pattern?  Do we have a serial killer on the loose in the city?
We were together six years, sir!
You know I don't like to watch talk shows by myself.  Where're you?
That's what I don't know.  Why would you lie?  That's the problem... I can't understand why anyone would lie.
And her husband? What was he?
No, I couldn't. I feel too close to her.
How can you drive? James... your legs. You can Barely walk.
I've never really noticed. Is Renata going with you?
No. But when he's in that car...
I think it's badly scarred too. From a motorcycle accident.
I'd like to go back. James...
James.
They said it was here. They told me this morning.
I work in the immigration department there.
When I first met Vaughan, he was a specialist in international computerized traffic systems. I don't know what he is now.
I don't know. You can never be sure with Vaughan. This is his show.
I can drive.
I'm going to leave now. Do you want a lift?
It's the future, Ballard, and you're already part of it. For the first time, a benevolent psychopathology beckons towards us. For example, the car crash is a fertilizing rather than a destructive event - a liberation of sexual energy that mediates the sexuality of those who have died with an intensity impossible in any other form. To fully understand that, and to live that... that is my project.
I think in the spirit of group therapy, it's beneficial for each of us to open ourselves up to the others.
Drugs can help suppress symptoms. But lots of patients stop taking them when they're on their own because the side effects are so harsh.  And, Michael's condition is often worsened by periods of stress. He's been in and out of...
Then, you should call.
Are you saying I'm through with therapy?
I'll talk to her, and to Dad, too.  A few wisely-chosen guilt tactics and they'll be ours.
Really?
Yeah, it'll be fun.
What's the matter?
It'll be fine.
I'll be back before you can say souffle.
Mom and I fought for 20 minutes over whether we should go with ecru invitations or brilliant white.
Mom, please.
We all agree with the doctor, Dear. He thinks it's safer for you to stay here for a while.
Just think, pretty soon, we'll be doing all these wedding preparations for you.  Of course, if that's what you still want. Ruthie told me some silly story about a crush on some boy here.
Mom, please.
I've already made arrangements.
Don't be fresh.
Green spot.
Mottled really.   Green and red.
To talk?  Well, OK, that might be good.
It's OK.   It's good to let it out.
Is this really important? Because I don't think it's a problem.
Stop acting like you're someone special. You're just like the rest of us.
Anything interesting.
Paul.
Good God.
Exactly.
I don't like lamb.
I do.
Michael, I...
I was brilliant, or at least boringly sane.
I saw Paul leaving.    Did you do the dirty deed?
Yeah.
All over.  Did you see your new apartment?
First off, you'll need to go to Target. And, let's see, what should you buy?
I better make a list.
Aren't you ever quiet?
Very trendy. Let's see the rest.
I think you know I'd love you even more in a blue polyester cap.
Oh. And, Harry, he's the one who likes magic?
You don't have to know all this by Saturday. It took me years.
And all the plans we have.
Someone has to take care of you right now, Michael. You tore up the apartment. You stopped taking your medications.
I love you too, Letty.     I love you, too.
How about something better?   Like a kiss.
She's only known the guy a few months.
I really think if you're going to spend your life with someone you want to know them pretty damn well.
Maybe you ought to see a doctor.
Yeah.
I think we need to talk about some things.
Especially this last year.
I need to tell you something, and I'm not sure how.
I love him.
What does that mean?
Do you know who this is?
A pass? How you gonna give me a pass? A witness can put me at the crime scene.
They don't have a murder weapon?
Hey, you're not exactly the most trustworthy guy in the world. I took a shot. It didn't work. Did you bring the tapes?
I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
Fuck Bastaldi and his brother. These tapes are gold. Do you have any idea what Zammito would pay to get them back?
Then we just have to make sure everyone who knows can't say anything.
What?   This?
You're calling me on is phone?
C'mon, Laurant, America?
I don't have it. That's why Vincent went to Chicago. They arrested him before he could bring it back.
Well, you better get the money somehow. Six o'clock and come alone. If you don't we'll destroy the tapes.
I'm good.   Really.
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
I'm taking a vocabulary course to enhance my communication skills.
And?
You should. You can learn a lot about the criminal justice system on a program like that. Very informative. Stay and watch it with me.
We're leaving. Raymond get the bag.
No one? Then why is Zero here?
What about the money?
I'm trying.    It doesn't work.
You didn't buy batteries?
Better than spending my life crawling through windows in the middle of the night.
I just want to live long enough to get back to Paris. Just long enough to kill Bastaldi.
What'd you get?
You haven't answered my question.
You better.
What do you want now?
Guns.   Can you get them?
I've got a way with people.
Hector, don't interrupt me.
I don't give a shit about your cousin's car. We're here about my car. So, shut your mouth! You think you can do that? You think you can keep your big mouth shut?
You didn't say find them. You said, "get them."
Just find them!
Okay boss.
Great fuckin' song.
Dead bodies. The ones in the Lincoln are your... associates.
A Wallet.    A hotel room card.    Some cash.
I can handle the exterior alarm, but the one in the bedroom is a problem.
You know, a little of this, a little of that. I've boosted cars, stole radios, run a few scams. Right now I'm into pick-pocketing.
Yeah, but you did do it.   So let's deal with that.
I'm the driver.
Stop talking. I'm trying to concentrate.
I don't know.     It's gotta be millions.
Yeah and he can't stand it that I tried to do something to better myself.
No.
No.   It's mine.
I'm telling you that's my car!   And someone's gonna pay for it!
Fuck me?   Fuck you!
It's simple. Bastaldi's moving up. He's closing down his operation and this is his way of saying thanks to all of us.
And you don't speak French?
How are we supposed to sleep with this noise?
You wanna tell him?
Take a nap.
Something like that.
You ask a lot of questions.
No. I got it in prison. I went in for three years. When I came out she was married to my best friend. Happy?
Yeah. I mean besides that.    They treating you all right? Food okay?
Yeah. I mean, you are my brother and... well I should have found another way of expressing my disappointment. So, I've decided to make it up to you.
For me? What am I going to do with a piece of shit like this?
I'll get you the papers tomorrow.
Why do you want to teach me?
Yes, you do!  You are still my disciple.
Put them down.
Beautiful but dangerous.  Once you see it tainted with blood, its beauty is hard to admire.  It's 400 years old.
My friend Li Mu Bai.  He's given it to Sir Te as a gift.
You know what I mean.  I'm getting married soon, but I haven't lived the life I want.
What do you think?
You're probably right.
Maybe it is.  I wouldn't know.
About you and Li Mu Bai?
Don't distance us.  From now on, let's be like sisters.
You know about Lo?
You're working together to set me up!  I'm leaving!
Kneel!
You coward!
Not true.  I can use it to pick fleas from my horse.
So you're still that little boy looking for shooting stars.
You were enlightened?
I am.  He has always been our greatest protector.
First I must visit my master's grave.  It's been many years since Jade Fox murdered him.  I have yet to avenge his death.  And yet I'm thinking of quitting.  I must pray for his forgiveness.
What have you discovered?
Then, why did you come?
That can't be!  Everything has an antithesis!  Why not this?
No mercy will be shown toward the murderer who turned up in Peking.
A female criminal!  Now that's news!
Please do not be such a stranger. You'll stay the night as my guest. Now, Shu Lien... tell me something. And forgive me for prying.  Your father was a great friend to me, and I think of you as my own daughter.
Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this.
What do you have in mind?
Don't any of your little pals have real, grown up names?
I'm buying.
They make you fart.
I knew that.
The others are called Skank, T- Bird.  Street names.  Funboy.  Watch me, office Albrecht.
You went out the window.  She was beaten and raped.  She died in the hospital.
It's only a flesh wound.
Leave here.  Don't do this.  I don't want you here.
He was a present.  Besides, we're moving anyway.  You said.
It can't rain all the time.
Not me.
Mister Funboy lives there?
He has a room, upstairs.  I don't like him very much.
Right.
Victims.  Aren't we all.
Magic.
Miss her?
Whoa, hey, whoa.  Business.
This is a cobra, Mr. Grange.  Yes, it is real.
Annette Harrison.
I don't think so.
Did you know Sebastian well?
Now I remember. Annette Harrison. Your father's the new headmaster at Oakwood.
That's right.
Kathryn, I know all about you and Sebastian.
From who?
No.
Most people are morons. I mean who are you to knock what you've never experienced?
Romantic? He rapes her.
Refreshing.
About what you said today in the stable. I'm not a happy person.
I never said that.
Fine. Friends it is. I can live with that.
How are you today?
I wish I could say the same for myself. I was up thinking about you all night.
I'm sorry, but I'm not here to be your savior.
Well try this one on for size. I think I'm falling in love with you.
Yes, but only when it's mutual. And this is far from mutual.
If that's a problem, then I'll make arrangements to stay with some friends.
How was your date?
Babe, you're looking at the next Mother Teresa.
Oh please.
What?
You don't know Monsieur Philipe?
I can't handle it. I can't keep my feelings bottled up like you. Can you honestly tell me that you feel nothing for me? ... Tell me!
Sebastian, please. I don't want us to end on bad terms.
You don't even know me. The fact of the matter is there is some one I love. She's smarter, prettier... you don't even compare to her. The only reason I am here is because she wants us to be exclusive.
Any ideas who it could be?
Alright, I believe you. Stop crying. Your secret's safe with me.
Relax. It's okay. Take a deep breath.
What a loser she must be.  Anyhow, Court's invited me to the Hamptons for Labor Day Weekend.
That's great.
What are you scared of?
Do you want to learn or not?
Oh come on Cecile. He's crazy about you.
Well do you like him?
Cecile, we just made out in the middle of Central Park. You can trust me.
Okay.
Something awful happened last night.
If she knew, she'd kill me. It happened at your house last night.
So, let me get this straight. You came over to our house late last night and he forced intercourse on you.
But that would make me a slut.  Wouldn't it?
And then I can go home?
I know.
This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. I'm trying to help you.
Don't even think about it. Rachel is an exceptionally well rounded young woman, who happens to be attending Princeton this fall. She's way too smart to fall for your line of b.s.
Would you cut the psycho babble bullshit, mom. There's pictures of me on the internet.
It's Sebastian. He's out of his mind.
I'll be right there.
So that's what this is all about.  We'll get together and plan your curriculum.
Sounds intriguing.
Care to make a wager on that?
Oh well, duty calls. Time to add another chapter to my work of art.
Could you be more desperate to read it?
Be more specific.
In English.  I'll fuck your brains out.
Even there?
Cecile.
I'm aware.
Nothing.
Excuse me?
P-whipped, p-whipped.
How have you dumped girls in the past?
Ronald?
War it is.
Like your step-brother Sebastian. I can't believe they didn't expel him after what he did to the school nurse.
Whatever. You are never to set foot in this house again and you are never and I mean never to see my daughter again. Is that understood?!
I've already told you, she's not home.
She's out.
Annette! Annette!
She really loves me.
Don't know what I'm talking about? I know that you fucked Cecile.
I know how it is.  My Dad collects miniature canon.
Yes,  She's a little odd, I understand.
No. I only let her go with Edward.  It's alright.
It's been ages since I've even thought of a mummers' play. When I was in college we used to do them every year â€ St. George and the Dragon, all kinds of sword dances.
Are they nice?
Wouldn't it be just the same, darling, if daddy dropped the present at Mrs. Farren's on his way to town tomorrow morning?
She's not Irena's child -- there's nothing of Irena in her. She's my child.
What?
Amy picked it off the top of that stack. Perhaps you'd better go through the whole bunch. There may be others of Irena in there.
No, she went runnin' off to some old house she was talkin' about yesterday.
Yes, I did.
Where did you mail them?
I'll show you.
Certain wishes do.
It was just a voice.
Yes, Amy?
Because she is my friend.
I don't know yet.
Yes, yes! I see Prince,
That one's an elm.
But we don't have any sea weed.
A merry Christmas to you, Amy.
That's a fine-looking ring.
A lady threw it to me.
Maybe, if it's a real mourning ring like we have in Jamaica. All you got to do is turn it on your finger, close your eyes, and make a wish.
You just wait until I finish here. I've got to dust these ships for your Dad.
Will you come soon?
I do suppose so. But if you were there yesterday, guess you can get there today.
But she's such a nice lady.
The ring? We'll have no more nonsense about the ring.
Who is she?
My little girl said she'd kill you if you came to see me. I can't let you die. We'll have to hide you.
Yes, yes -
I can't do it! I can't do it!
Gray. They were a lovely, lovely gray.
But there was nothing, no one in the garden.
Perhaps she's wanted for understanding.
My brother has an answer to PMS. A-S-S: Abundant Sperm Syndrome. A man gets sperm build-up, and if his woman isn't givin' it to 'em, he's gotta get it elsewhere.
Yul Brynner. They're all dead.
Never felt better.
No, I'm not a lesbian. Geez mom.
I get a little bloated sometimes.
What do I need overpriced fancy underwear for? Shouldn't a guy have already decided that he likes me before he sees me in lingerie?
There's a sale. It's such a nice place -- classical music, relaxing atmosphere. You deserve to pamper yourself. Come on, it can't hurt.
And she got the medium.
What a bitch. You should see a doctor. That can be dangerous. George bit me once and I had to go to the emergency room.
Maybe they have to pee.
You are not Frida, we all have a little hair there. I didn't even notice till you showed me. We can bleach that, it's no big deal.
And he was ripped limb from limb?
It's just as well. I'm afraid of getting hurt again. Mark seemed great at first too. I don't want to get too attached to Peter and then find out he's a creep.
What? Why'd you do that?
Check out what I found.
No, he's the guy I'm having an affair with.
Oh, a D-Girl. You know... I have a really great idea for a screenplay.
They say sex is great for cramps.
This really isn't a good time.
It's the truth. If you'd just loaned me the money last time this never would have happened.
Script coverage?
On your desk.
Did you change your hair?
Very well then. Is that all?
We... he walked me home and... we said goodnight. Um, he kissed me goodnight and that was it.
There's a lot of that going around.
Some decaf then? That was stupid. Obviously you said you were staying away from caffeine as a nice way of blowing me off.
No really, I love knowing what people read.
Speaking of Mark -- we've tried to track him down and there's no sight of him. Vanished into thin air. I got a hunch he fled the country.
They're for my cat. I use them to train him not to rip up paper.
No. It doesn't work that way. Men can't get PMS. Unfortunately.
Okay.
Thanks.
No, I said it was our first date.
What makes you think I was the last one?
Yeah, sorry. Uh... Gregory's roommate told us you were out with him last night.
I don't know, I guess the outfits are cool. And I want a big gun.
Hey, there was a lot of blood.
She was never a suspect Lloyd. Some animal must have done this.
Waiting for DNA tests. He was hairier than Madonna in Penthouse.
Yeah, IÃ­m like that.  Senility says the wife.  But she sure canÃ­t complain.  Heh.  The erector set still works good.  And this ainÃ­t no fucking rug! GÃ­head.  Feel it!  All mine!
He's seriously disturbed...
Thompson suffered a kind of severe delusion or some damn thing.  Anyway he isnÃ­t with us any longer.  The case is yours.  Go through his files. Take what you need.  By the way, howÃ­s your mother?
How could you have been so stupid?
I didnÃ­t requisition a secretary.
Well be more careful, please.
Please...
No, it's the truth.
Everyone get's one  -  very much like this...  But this one's special.  It will help you understand, everything...
No it isn't.  <u>You</u> are doing it!  Now raise it over the glass and...
We are...  living in their dreams...
`Cause you know I can do other stuff. I mean,  if you wanted me to talk or...
Is this dangerous or anything?
Oh, sure.  Remember the convention speech?
It's in the little leaguer who may strike out but knows in his heart that at least swung...  Hands to the side...
You're lint!  You're a flea!  You're a blip!
Don't call the Vice President!
TilT we figure something out.
What about containment, Alan?
What about her.
Everybody else is buying the minor stroke'  story...
Check his kids.
I'm going to kill him.
Just what you think I mean.
Oh yeah... 1'm fine...
Oh, yeah... probably...
But we went there.  We saw those kids.
He's not.
Does it make the cars any better?
Yes, it's designed to bolster individual confidence in a previous domestic automotive purchase.
Why?
So we're spending forty-seven million dollars to make people feel better about a car they've already bought?
Oh, come on, we're not children.  I didn't have anything to do with this Fidelity nonsense and you know it.
Oh... Kinda the same way.
We'd like to hire you.
The Vice-President...
Well...
Since when do you care about the homeless?
Yeah.  I'm sure it's keeping you up nights.
There's no mistake, Bill.   If you veto their funding, it's not a mistake. If you hurt someone intentionally, it's not a mistake.
I'm not the First Lady, anymore.  I shouldn't be here.
You mean when I'm not running the country?
But you could go to jail for it.
I mean, I want to... I just, I feel strange...
) Thought I needed a little change.  You like it?
Dammit...  I told them no mayo.  See - - I could veto this Simpson Garner thing, but I really don't want to do that...
What about the intro?
Two of us...only two of us...me...and him. 
I don't believe you, rebel. Where are your headquarters? On the mainland?
The mainland...is dead...a dead place...nobody there...
Then why did you come here?
I'm sorry, General, if I...spoke out of turn. It's just that...Mr Tyler is not here to defend himself. He has no representation. I don't believe due process is being served by...
Curse?
We're only about a quarter-mile from Cave entrance number five.
The hospital? 
Oh, I have no doubt.
It's because of me.
We need fuel, and a couple automatics.
Will do.
Don't come.
Yeah.
The point is she was thinking about me! I've only met her once and already she's thinking about me.  Damn it, it's gonna happen!  I feel it.  She's going to be mine!
Ahh!  Eat it, Dalton!
It's Nuwanda, Cameron.
But...
Oh yeah.  Sure.  Valedictorian, National Merit Scholar
You're welcome to join us, Todd.
Nothing, unless you object to having girls here.
I'm one of the proofers.  I slipped the article in.
Hey, would you not worry about your precious little necks?  If they catch me, I'll tell them I made it up.  All your asses are safe.  Look, Gloria and Tina didn't come here to listen to us argue. Are we gonna have a meeting or what?
Maybe he'll have some advice.  Maybe he'll even talk to your father.
No.
I gotta find Chet.  Make yourself at home.
I don't care.  I love you, Chris.  You deserve better than Chet and I'm it. Please accept these.
Then you wouldn't be here warning me about Chet.
Then come with me.
Uh-huh.
I promise.  Dead Poets honor.  Come with me tonight, then if you don't want to see me again, I swear I'll bow out.
I didn't know you taught.
Your reprimand made quite an impression I'm sure.
LOUDER!
A madman.  Perhaps he was.  What kind of madman?  Don't think!  Answer.
Use your imagination!  First thing that pops to your mind, even if it's gibberish!
Now there's the poet speaking!  Close your eyes and think of the picture. Describe what you see.  NOW!
Actually, I'd like to talk to you alone.
Not if you're going to stay true to yourself.
What I have to do.  Screw the annual.
Nobody-  I thought I'd surprise you. I've got all As and-
Father, I have the main part.  The performance is tomorrow night.  Father, please.
What?
Thanks but  I'd better do history.
Yes.  But
What?
From my father and Nolan.
Yea, art thou there?
And where is our point of arrival?
What are you people talking about?
You hear that?
What's that supposed to mean? You people.
Thank you, I work at it...
You should talk...
Not like him.
Not unless you can wire a missle or fix an engine.
No...
...we gotta get outta here -- NOW.
I know...I know...if the cash is there we don't care...  Finnegan this is as mean a pile of shit as we ever carried...
No! The man in the moon!! Who's driving this thing?
Red cross over to blue double blue ...is that what it is? A squid?
Shut up!
John...
She fucked me too.
What?
Hey Geraldine, let's eat!
Who? Who is?
I do!!!
In case!!! The gun's in case!!!
Hey, Nick! God damn!... What've you been doin', I mean...
Sure. Why not.
Nick... Sal is very weak. He suffered a severe wound... and right now he doesn't want a whole lot of people to get involved in a whole thing.
No. None of that.
Where is he???
Merle is under his tree... Beside the terrace. You can't miss him.
You call me Linda, just like home.
Too bad.
Worse since she talked to him.
Nick, she won't say why.
Fine. I just go along, you know. Down at the market. Back here. I mean it just seems there's a million things to do!... Are you sure you're all right? I mean, what about the wound?
Frost.
That's wonderful. I think you should... fresh air.
C'mon. I've got the car.
I'll be out... Just leave me. I'll be out. I'm fine. Really. I'm fine.
Mais certainment... A great deal of money. Naturally I do not do it myself. I myself do not possess the nerve.  But I am always... how do you say... looking out for those who do... It is a thing quite rare. Champagne perhaps? Tch, tch. Don't say no. When a man says no to champagne, he says no to life and that no man must ever do.  Where did you play?
Playing.
Right.
I know.
Yeah.  When it comes to hunting, that's true.
Pow.
YOU'RE CRAZY!!!... NO WAY!... NOW YOU'RE CRAZY!!! YOU'RE COMPLETELY CRAZY!!!
I did. I... This is stolen. I came back.
Watch it, shithead!
No.
You gotta learn, Vince! You come out here... You got no jacket, you got no pants, you got no knife and you got no boots. You think everyone's gonna take care of you! That's what you always think, but this time you're wrong. This time you're on your own!
You know what I think? There's times I think you're a goddamn faggot!... I fixed you up a million times, Merle!  I fixed him up a million times! I don't know how many times I fixed him up... and nothin' ever happens... Zilch! Zero!... The trouble with you, Merle, no one knows what you're talking about! "This is this"? What does that mean, "this is this"? I mean is that some faggot bullshit, or is that some faggot bullshit!!! And if it isn't, what the hell is it???
Oh. You know. How's it with you?
Did you get one?
Merle gave me this?
Trip? What do you mean, Nick? You said you'd be --
Didn't I ever tell you about Phantom Mary?
Never one.
Down.
What'cha got, Bennett?
Technothugs?
I'd think about it.
Don't threaten me.  I tend to take these things seriously.  And get a couple hours sleep.  You look like day old shit.
Not anymore.
We have to talk.
Fine.
You can't catch this man with a computer.
Drop it.
Good night.
You're not pregnant, are you?
No, sir.
I'm here.
You never want to find out.
Well I've got news for you.  This dirty cop was the <u>only cop</u> who could bag Doucet.
I don't care if you've got the Good Housekeeping seal of approval... I'm not looking for company.
From over the mountain --
Oh --  Didn't mean to talk like that in front of a lady.  Get some wine for the Squire, Belle.
Young man -- you got me there.
Golly -- I'd like to see all your horses!
No, no, I don't want to go to bed. I want to be here for the party.
That's just too bad --
Well -- here's how it is ...Tom Sharp, Eli Higgins and a couple of others been talking to me about -- that new sort of organization -- grange they call it. What you think about it?
Almost seven.  No -- no, he's not seven yet I am sure --
-- of what happens after we die!
What does it mean here -- about my soul?
Small? Oh, I see what you mean. Why, they vary.  Now a man like Daniel Webster, if I ever get hold of him, I'd have to build a special box for him and even at that, I imagine, the wing spread would be astonishing.  In your case --
My time isn't up yet.
Are you willing to give me your son in exchange for an extension of our contract?
Gentlemen, the prosecution rests.
Not at all, lad -- not at all.  For a good game of horseshoes I would always sacrifice fame and acclaim.
Well -- I'll be -- if it isn't little Mary Sampson from Franklin.
It's your fault! You brought Daniel Webster here -- just to try to make a fool of me! You played the sneak behind my back -- made up all sorts of lies against me! You can get yourself out of my home -- go back to the other house -- that old place, where you belong -- I don't want to -- to talk to you again!
Dan'l Webster is coming to my party.
Coming.
You're right, Mary.
That's what we said.
You always said, the field uphill needs a rest, but if you think --
Tired?
Worried!
Yes -- you are right, Mary. I can almost hear the little blades of grass a-starting up -- All the seeds a-stirring underneath the ground --
I'll get it, Jabez.
It shows on your face.
Sorry, Ma -- but this consar-- this little pig --  He won't let me fix him --
Not on the Sabbath you won't, Jabez!
That's a word you're too free with lately, Jabez, consarn this and consarn that ...
Helps sometimes to say it.
Most outlandish thing I ever heard tell.  Don't seem right, somehow!
Say, Mary, how is your shoulder?
I feel -- fidgety, Ma -- not right at all.
I figure that depends a mite on how you get it and how you spend it, Son.
A man can always change things, Son. That's what makes him different from barnyard critters.
Now that's the way to talk, Son! I know you worked hard for that crop. But we'll make out.
Make out? We'll do better than that!  I never thought I'd be glad for bad luck, but I am. I never thought I'd be glad of a hail storm at harvest time, but I am! Oh, bless ye the works of the Lord in the hail and the storm and the rain!
You'll be a father any minute now.
And I say she won't! I'll not have the scorn of God on this place -- with the smell of fish in it, polluting up the Sabbath!  And as for you -- let me tell you, young woman...!
Of course it's all right, son. You had Daniel Webster, didn't ye?  Breakfast's ready!  I've made a special surprise for Mr. Webster.
Mary -- Jabez --
Yes, Jabez -- don't worry.
I said you should stop worrying because I've made up my mind!
You aren't angry with me?
Martin Van Buren Aldrich and my Pa's the only Democrat in Cross Corners. He said you had horns and a tall, Mr. Webster, but I ain't seen 'em yet.
Well, Martin, I only wear them in Washington -- that's the trouble. But if you ever come down there, I'll show them to you.
Gee, would you, Mr. Webster? Honest?
Of course. And you tell your father for me -- we may be on opposite sides of the fence, but I'm always glad to hear of a man who holds to his own opinions. As long as people do that -- the country's all right. Do you understand, Martin?
Of course not --
If it's the British Minister, take him around to the pantry and give him some Madeira --
Why, that's different!  Well, boys, I guess we'll knock off. I've got to see a friend.
Well, I never heard the dev-- of your claiming American citizenship.
Let it be the quick or the dead -- So it is an American judge and an American jury!
Do I?  I'm sorry.  You're gonna have to help me, man.  This is my first time driving a limo.
The past six months.
Meanwhile, you still live in New York?
Closer to Japan.  You're fast.
What is it don't work out that way? Where you gonna stay?
John.
His 'job' is 3000 miles away.  Without him, they might let us go...at least we have a chance...
Hey, I negotiate million dollar deals for breakfast.  I can handle these clowns.  I want to talk to Hans.  Hans! Sprickenzie talk?
Ellis, what have you told them?
Okay.
'Yippe-ki-yea, mother fucker'?  Now you are fucked.
I'm an exceptional thief, Mrs. McClane. And now that I'm moving up to kidnapping, you should be more polite.
Oh...Where does he live?
No matter what it did to our marriage -- ?
Holly Gennero?
I've spent half my life on airplanes,			* I can recognize someone who just got off one.  I'm Joe Takagi, Mr. McClane.  I have ...something to do with this company.
Two?  Are you sure?
In my youth, partner.  In my youth.
Yeah.  But all things being equal, I'd rather be in Philadelphia.  By the way, chalk up two more terrorists.
Hey, you couldn't know.
Ask the FBI.  They've got the terrorist playbook and they're running it, step by step.
Whattaya think: we gonna kill any civilians tonight, Gene?
Fuck you, sir - if I'm right, I don't need you.  What I want is - if I make an honest mistake I want help.
What about the kids?
They don't know, I sent them to the neighbors.  Sonny, Jesus, it's not like you.  I can't believe, because you never hurt anybody since the day I knew you.
I blame myself, Sonny.  I notice you been tense, like something is happening; the night before last you're yellin' at the kids like a madman, believe me.  And then you wanted me to go on this ride with the kids, this caterpillar about from here to there - fulla one- year-old kids.  It's ridiculous. I'm not about to go on this ride, so you yell right there, 'You pig, get on the fuckin' ride!' Well, everything fell outta - me - my heart, my liver fell to the floor - you name it!  Yellin' at me in front of all those people.  Because you never talked and I never been scared of you, never.  I think: he's gonna shoot me and dump my body in the river.
See?  You're screaming with the language and all!  A person can't communicate with you.  You become a stranger in your own home...
Jesus - what - I'm afraid - I'm gonna get shot or whatever.  You oughta see it on TV, the guns, the cops, they got cannon, machine guns, they're loaded with gear.
They're not after you, they're after me.
Jackie - what are you talking about?
Take the subway.  We need the car.  Hey, gimme the keys - the keys!
It's okay... it's okay...
Yeah, well...maybe you better talk to one of these others, okay?
I never thought I'd get out this way.  I'll tell you.
Oh... huh ... how you feeling?
You come in and they say, right away, that you are crazy.  And they start putting things in your arm... you know.  How do they expect you to get uncrazy if you're asleep all the time?
Fine, thank you.  I'm in trouble. That is... now I am!
Now don't give me that deep shit now.  Don't start with that shit.
No really... I don't think that you realize what it means.  The things that you do, Sonny.  You put a gun to somebody's head...
I'm free to do what I want?  And you think I would want to go with you some place on a plane?  Where? Where ya going?
I know!
Why you going to Algeria?
I like that... yeah!
Oh... wow!  Sonny, you're really into one mess now.
I can't survive in prison, Sonny...
They won't talk to you.
Well... I don't know if I have or not.
Yeah... yeah.
Yeah... see ya in my dreams, huh?
You said a mouthful... sweetheart!
Ten days I spent in Atlantic City - Sonny was frantic - he knew I was drinking; he didn't know where I was ... who I was with.  I couldn't explain why I did the things I did. So I went to this psychiatrist who explained to me I was a woman in a man's body.  So Sonny right away wanted to get me money for a sex change operation: but where was he to get that?  2500 dollars!  My God, he's in hock up to his ears already.
It made him crazy - so much demand, he'd fly into this rages.  And I got more depressed than ever; I saw I'd never get the operation.  So I tried to take my life - I swallowed about a half pound of pills ... blues, reds, yellows, downers, uppers, screamers ... you name it. But I just threw them up and wound up in the hospital.  Sonny comes there and looks at me and just says: 'Wow!'  So when I hear he's in the bank, I almost go crazy because I know he's doin' it for me.
You think it over, Leon.
I got Sal.
Sonny-boy, one word?
Okay, Sonny, I want to see if the people in the bank are okay, then what I want to do is work out a way to get them out of there.  I want to come over there, without a gun ... and you can frisk me.  So you can see you can trust me.  So we can talk and find a way outta this mess.
The girl hostages.
I swear to God I had nothing to do with it ...
Wait a minute ... everything you asked for is on the way ...
Yeah ...
Just one more explosion like that and you're gonna see a dead body ...
We're bringing in your wife...
To what ... learn how to shoot? They don't get a gun.
They make $105 a week to start. They fold the flag, check the place out in the morning.  I don't know what they learn, Sonny.
What now, Sonny?
I'm not going.  I'm okay.
I stay here.  Damn it.  I just needed the insulin.  I'm used to it. Go on.  Go on.
You seem like a likable enough guy. It's hard to judge.
Would I hire you?
No.  I had some legal training, but...
What now, Sonny?
I used to, but I stopped.
You don't want cancer?  You're about to get your head blown off, you're worried about cancer.  Gimme the cigarette.
For God's sake!  As soon as I'm outta this bank robbery, I'm gonna stop ... okay?
Well, I stalled him for a while. When it comes the time, then we'll work it out.  Okay?
Dead or alive?
Alive.
I figure maybe we can get the FBI to make a deal ...
Everybody!  Back here!
They gotta stop sayin' that.
He was showin' me how the airport bus is comin' in, like that, Sal.  What's wrong with him?
Aw, Jesus ... you been doin' us favors all night!
What's the matter... they never housebroke you?
Goodbye, honey.  Wish us luck!
Like what?  Bank teller?  What do they get paid -  ... they pay one hundred thirty- five dollars and thirty-seven cents to start.  I got a wife and kids. I can't live on that -- You want to live on that?  What do you make a week?
You could give up.

If I wasn't a righteous Black man you'd be in serious trouble. SERIOUS.
And I--we--want some Black people up.
What da fuck!  Are you deaf?
We're not hanging out.  I'm being escorted back to work.
You're a drunk fool.
Hold your tongue.  You don't have that much love.
I didn't.
I hope the block is still standing.
I said my name is Eddie Lovell.
I think no such a thing.  Sal pays you, you should work.
You're raggedy as a roach.  You eat the holes out of donuts.
It's a motherfucking shame.

No, just checking.

You gonna open up another Sal's Famous Pizzeria?
Yeah!...I'm goin' to the beach for the first day in fifteen years. Gonna take the day off and go to the beach.
I can dig it.  It's gonna be HOT as a motherfucker.
I want you to spend some time with me.  I want you to try and make this relationship work.  If not, I'd rather not be bothered.
Bring some ice cream, I'm burning up.  Do you love me?
How else was I going to get you here?  I haven't seen you in a week.
Where's the ice cream?  The HÃ¤agen- Dazs butter pecan?
I just forgot.
Long enough for us to do the nasty.
Trust me.
Why you gotta curse?
Later for you.
Yes, yes, Lord.  Isn't this better than Haagen-Dazs butter pecan ice cream?
Fuck dat shit.  I deliver pizzas. That's what I get paid for.
You get paid to do what we say.
Remember what I said.
That's what you think?
It's Prince.  He's a Prince freak.
HATE!
Stop busting my balls.  I said I'm listening ten fucking times already.
Yeah, no more ninety-minute deliveries around the corner.
Twenty minutes.  How come you niggers are so stupid?

Four colors? Neato!
A-ha! I had a feeling it was all a fake.
Would you like something to drink?
LLOYD? What about Ms. Heller?
Sit down, I have something to tell you.
No, that's not it. Anyway -  LLOYD Christmas.
Is that what I think it is?
What?
And nobody will make fun of your horrible deformity.
Who's Captain Rob?
Sounds like a pirate.
What? No no. He's got a parrot on his shoulder, buries treasure...
Yeah, go-cart accident.
What?
I learned it from listening to you! I hate you!
Don't look directly at him.
Oh, no. You're not gettin' me again.
I think she wants me to come over to put me into the right position to check out her delicates, what ever that means.
Sure I do. On one condition.
HARRY!
A turd.
Yeah, that's why I asked.
Now it makes total sense why she didn't want him to know we were in his office the other night.
I lugged it all over town!
I don't know who we are anymore.

You're a great teacher, Lloyd.
And with that complete loser
Right.
What?
I'm not interested. Not after the smear story you did on my chicken sushi.
Why are you teaching Special Needs? You're the lunch lady.
Look Ms. Heller, there's something fishy here, and I don't think it's Friday's special.
And, Ching Chong, you're not a Special Needs kid. You're just a foreign exchange student.
Do you want me to pet your head?
Come on, I live with the janitor. I have a key to every room in the school.
Principal's office? Yeah, I guess I can swing that.
Maybe it's this mix tape I made you. Or maybe these flowers. He gives Jessica the flowers and tape.
Let's just do it and get out of here.

I know the Bhotani Jib and Chakobsa, all the hunting languages.
Your Reverence.
Oh great mother!  He's trying the voice. The Reverend Mother said it could save him.
 Where are my feelings... I feel for no one...
You and your Bene Gesserit sisterhood... I'm not your Kwisatz Haderach...  I'm something different, something unexpected!  I'm a seed.  I am so much more...  You don't begin to know me...
Your suit is fitted desert fashion. Who told you how to do that?
Let us say I suggest you may be human. Your awareness may be powerful enough to control your instincts. Your instincts will be to remove your hand from the box. If you do so you will die. You will feel an itching -- there... see? Now the itching becomes burning... heat, upon heat, upon heat.
SILENCE... SILENCE.
You feel the flesh crisping?
Where?
Do you know of the Water of Life?... the Truthsayer drug?
They tried and died....  Jessica!
What can be done has been done.
SILENCE!
No.  I never drink -- wine.
I predict we're lost.
Really?
They were <u>mythic</u>.  They had a poetry to them.  And you know what else?  The women prefer the traditional monsters.
Take my word for it.  You want to "score" with a young lady, you take her to see "Dracula."
I am always on time.
Who do I play?
Uh, a cop.  NO!  You play the father. He's <u>angry</u>!  He doesn't like seeing his son -- no -- he doesn't like seeing his <u>daughter</u> behave this way!
No hospital.  Just take me to the couch...
Don't worry.  I'll do something.
"Beg to differ.  This casket incarpratates, er, inporporates --"
That's fine, Bela.  We're still rolling.  Just say "Dear, you're lovely."
Stop worrying.  This is going to raise your spirits.
Correct.  So instead, I stayed here, waiting for my comeback.  Always hoping... the next film, the next film... that would be the one.
Once you're in it, it warms up.
Fuck you!  <u>You</u> come out here.  Hey, toss me that J.D.
Bela, I'm on your side.  C'mon, give me the gun...  If you give me the gun, I'll make you a drink.  What are you drinking?
Really?  I don't feel so great.
No, this is just the second unit. We'll do the main footage later.
Ssh!  He's so big!  He's a <u>monster</u>! Can you imagine what that guy would be like in a movie?
Sound!
It's that easy?
My pleasure.  I'm always happy to assist in a little larceny.
We'll do our best.
The ghost can be barefoot.  <u>Give</u> <u>me your shoes</u>!
Ed, you're still young.  This is the part of your life when you're <u>supposed</u> to be struggling.
You got the job?!!
Who?  Robert Taylor?!
Oh!  You got nerve, buddy.
Exactly.
All I know is, ever since "Glen Or Glenda," all you do is booze it up and wear my clothes!
Did you really mean those things you said..?
You misunderstood.  I gave you everything I have in the world: Three-hundred dollars.
Sure thing, Mr. Kravitz.
Mr. Wood, you have bounced your third and final rent check.
<u>I'm</u> interested in the picture business.  My associates and I wish to produce a series of uplifting religious films, on the Apostles. But unfortunately, we don't have enough money.
Would that work?
From outer space!  It's science- fiction.  <u>Very</u> big with the kids! If you make this picture, you'll have enough money to finance a HUNDRED religious films!  <u>And</u> pay my back rent from the profits.
Look, Lugosi is dead and Vampira won't talk.   Ihad to give <u>somebody</u> the dialogue.
No.  She tink Lobo is waste of my time.  Lobo don't talk.
Bela, he talk.  Loretta, she talk. But Tor, he no talk.
Uh, uh, I'm a young filmmaker, and a really big fan... and I just wanted to meet you.
It's the damn money men.  You never know who's a windbag, and who's got the goods.  And then they all think <u>they're</u> a director...
Ain't that the truth!  I've even bad producers recut my movies --
And they always want to cast their buddies -- it doesn't even <u>matter</u> if they're right for the part!
Yes, I'm Ed Wood.  I'm here about directing the Christine Jorgensen picture.
Yeah!  Five pages right before it ends!  The rest of the show is about some schmuck who likes angora sweaters.
I don't think he's a schmuck.
They'll notice.  Look, why don't you let me take over from here?  I can do a few tricks: Pad it out with more stock footage, add establishing shots...
Good.  And one more thing.  I think your "Written, Directed, and Starring Ed Wood" credit is a bad idea.
Because I can't sell it to save my life!  You made a goddamn feathered fish.  Is it an art film, a horror show, a hygiene flick?  Nobody knows! I'm beggin' people to book it.
I got married last night.
The marriage already ended.
This is my thirteenth pair.
Not good...
Sounds like you lived in Grovers Corners.
Do you want your buttons on the left or the right?
No.  They're beyond that!  They're smarter than the humans.  What's <u>more</u> advanced?
Ed, you're gonna miss your own premiere.
<u>Right now</u>.  Let's drive to Vegas!
No.  I think my film is perfect for you.
Yeah...?
I suppose.  It's very expensive.
No you're not!  This marriage was never consummated.  I'm getting an annulment!
Yeah, so... ?
Oh, Al ... This is just...
You know, for a tearjerker. The audience falls in love with this loveable old geezer in a wheelchair and then he dies, it's ... They know what they're doing.
I bet my career on you. You'd better be good.
Don't say that. That's like... telling a guy before you have sex you'd better be good. You don't do that.
Ed --
Thank you. Can I see her?
Really? They were..
I ... don't know. I ...
We're falling behind.
So do I. So what? I'm doing all right.
Yeah?
Send him? Ma, I can't. it's -- just come out here. Please, I --
No! And that girl has a name.
You and Al lived together a few months before you got married -- after Dad left.
But what was that whole story about him and a nurse?
To you? In front of him?  With the...
Well, he's the only one in America who doesn't!
Why shouldn't I be in a place like this? I'm a whore!
Ma...
I'm a whore!  Your bathrooms are filthy!
She left. She moved. She got Fed-Ex to give her a transfer and she left. She couldn't stand it anymore. We had people, news people, regular people, just sleeping in our hallway, going through our mail, our garbage. I mean it was she couldn't take it anymore. Now I've got to move. I can't afford this place by myself.
I'm sorry. Where'd they send her?
Look, if you don't let me out of this... I'11 just... I'11 just sit in my apartment all day. I won't go anywhere, I won't do anything. What kind of show will that be?
Hm? I'm, uh... Why isn't this drunken woman you?
Look, not having been there... I just think you're hurt and you're saying this to, you know, get back at him.
Can't we just --
Oh yeah.
Saturday, I think we should
Shari...
Ohh...
Exactly. Boy, you're smart.  Why are you so mean to her? What did she do to you?  "Is she good enough for Ed?" Who the hell am I?  Who the hell do you think I should be dating?
No. It's your fault.
It's what I do. I yell "Geronimo" and jump out of a relationship.
What is?!
Show business.
Hi, Shari.  Let's go in the stockroom.
What?
Look -- there's a million ways to humiliate yourself - I gotta think of a new way? I mean, it's all day! Every minute. Id be like a monkey at the zoo. I just...
Whenever you ask me something why do you always say "Let me ask you something?" Why don't you just ask me?
I'm doing all right.
How many opportunities are you going to get in your life?
Yeah.
See, they should've picked him. Look how comfortable he is out there.
No. What happened?
She's an alcoholic, for Christ's sake.
You watching the ballgame?
You brought the cameras here!
Oh, man, I've been trying to call you.
I commit. I take a chance. You wanted to be the guy on TV, but you didn't want to say you wanted to. So you have me talk you into it so you get what you want, but if it goes bad it's not your fault.
A hundred per cent cotton. Okay, here we go, Andy.
Oh, is Shari here? Why didn't you just say so? Why are you giving me a song-and-dance about being tired?
It could be, if you fixed it up. How did you... ? I mean how does anyone ... wind up like this?
No. Two times.
Yeah. Why?
By the X.
pierdes.
El/ella -
Well, I notice you don't seem to have any close friends at Millard. You seem to be kind of a loner.
And I know sometimes people like you have to pay a price for their greatness, and that price is loneliness.
Yeah, just --
Dick.
Huh.  Okay.  Well, I guess I'd better do my count.
I know.
...the rules of conduct determined by a culture at a...
Could you approve them now?  I'd like to kick off my campaign right away, you know, in the morning.
I thought you were supposed to keep them.
Should be easy.  So far no competition.
Hell, you know, Coca-Cola's the world's number one soft drink, but they spend more money than anybody on advertising. I guess that's how come they stay number one.
I was.  So?  Mr. Pecharda let me in. As you know, with all my responsibilities I often come in on the weekend and have permission to do so. But I left very early, around 6:30.
I don't.  I just know they were there when I left.  I'm giving you helpful information is all.  You know, instead of wasting time interrogating me, we should be out there trying to find out who did this.
My house.
Walt, we can't throw her out of the election just because we don't like her speech.  That's not what student government's about.
Oh yeah, you bet.
What is it. Tammy?
Oh, come on.  You've had a hard year, you're cooped up with the kid all the time.  Let go; live a little.
All his life.  He's tried everything.
Take me to that motel.  Like you wanted.
And she's super-nice
Paul... Paul.... We'll have plenty of time to get into all this later.  A whole year, in fact. Right now I just need to finish my pie and get home.
Don't worry about Tracy.  She'll be fine.
I'm telling you. Dr. Hendricks, every vote was accounted for.
What...?
Well, I do.
I mean at you.
Paul, get out!
Okay, Paul.  Thanks.  Thanks a lot.
Yes.  But do you know?
That's right.  Our motives are selfish, so we're cooperating.
You fuck for money.
No.  I'm really a brunette, but the rest is me.  And that's all the news that's fit to print.
So you saved her.
I knew you had juice, but... There's no goddamn bill on me?
Seen him around.  He used to be a cop.
No.  I'll tell you sometime.  Not now.  Don't want to jinx it.  But it could take the edge off that jail time I got coming.
What was that boyfriend's name?
No!  Please leave!
The Nite Owl!  Stensland was going there to sell the heroin.
I was here, hosting a party.  Who was killed and why do you think I can help?
I think she'd been hit in the face with a tennis racket.  She is -- was -- a big doubles fan.
More.
It looks like she was flailing, trying to get away.
Exactly.  At least one of those animals had the brains to protect his ears.
And I'll promote you.  You'll be a lieutenant immediately.
Man, what're you saying?
Where do they get their stuff? Come on.  Give me one to feed the D.A.  Just a little one.
Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis...?  Yes or no, Edmund.
Jack was a shame, but Dick Stensland had the audacity to try to sell me my own heroin.  Through his whore girl friend.  I sent him to make the buy.  The rest is history.
Why not, lad?  Absolute justice?
Okay.  I'll do it.
I think you'll be surprised what Edmund's capable of.
<u>Shit</u>.  Someone beat us here.
Even I'm not that crazy.
Do you make the three Negroes for the Nite Owl killings?
What?
It's a simple question.
Rollo was a purse snatcher.  My father ran into him off duty.  He shot my father six times and got away clean.  No one even knew who he was.  I made the name up to give him some personality.
The Nite Owl was solved, Lieutenant.
Bud White.  He sees us and we're dead.
I get the idea.  You got a description?
Then try talking to my lawyer. Good evening, gentlemen.
Really?  What did White say?
Because you'll use it against me. Won't you?
Like recognizes like.  I'm pretty tough, myself.
I know how he feels.
Under the house.
I don't doubt it -- Oh, God.
Where'd you hear that?
Please hold the line... No such number is assigned.
Yes.
Listen--
They keep taking the bird seed. I thought since you're the expert on--
Alright, I made a joke about squirrels, don't get so--
Except for the part about my setting up a company in Zurich and knowing anyone named Sam Vollotti and having any relationship whatsoever with the Gambino family.
Rachel Banks?
What do they have to do with this?
Like a LowJack, but two generations ahead of what the police use. It pulses at 230 Giga-Hertz.
I don't know what that means.
I don't know what that means.
I don't know <u>anything</u>.
What am I gonna do?! I mean, like, for the rest of my <u>life</u>?!
What do you mean?
I mean did you call anyone.
I didn't use my name.
They shouldn't have come without calling first.
You're driving.
Those are Feds.
Fuckin-A.
Yeah, I can see where that'd--
Tell me about it.
The thing is, Senator, and I don't want to get in the middle of nothing, but--
Anytime.
It's a little late for that.
Listen, Daniel, hang on one second.
<u>Wildlife</u> footage, for God's sake. I don't see how he could've slipped you something that the FBI would be interested in.
That's my point.
Daniel's life is already ruined. Maybe if you guys stopped thinking about yourselves for a change and--
Hey, did you guys find my stuff?
Oh...yeah, I didn't see the accident.
You tell me.
To buy lingerie.
Right.
Robert--
I think you should leave now, Robert.
Was that doctored-up, too?
Yeah.
Maybe it's not connected yet.
My suitcase is gone.
Not that much.
I just want to make sure I'm not breaking the law.
Eat your fish.
You being audited?
You don't work there anymore, Bobby.
Goddammit, Rachel, you assured me--
I don't <u>have</u> a life, Bobby. I'm in love with a married man.
We'd like to ask you some questions about Daniel Zavitz.
Otherwise you may have to what?
We'd rather not--
I don't under--
A leave of absence. Until we've sorted this all out.
Do I know you?
Usually they take clothes.
They didn't take the silverware?
I'm a labor lawyer. There are <u>always</u> mob ties.
You gotta let me bring you in to the police.
Yeah?
Yeah?
Go fuck yourself.
What does that have to do with you?
Yes. But we can't.
Why not?
What?
Is that anyway to talk to an old school chum?
He had help.
Sir--
Dean's with Lyle.
What's your ETA?
Three minutes. We're going in light. Myself and two others. Everyone else is held back in reserve.
How'd you get in the building?
Puffed cheese?
No thank you.
Yes, thank you, Gyges, son of Daskylus - Candaules said to him I don't think you believe me when I tell you how beautiful my wife is. And although Gyges replied he did find the Queen magnificent the King insisted he would find some way to prove beyond dispute that she was fairest of all women.  Do you all know this story?
Hello!  Good morning.
You've been cheated, don't worry, we'll take it back.
What do you mean, poetry?
Ask Al Auf. AlmÃ¡sy asks Al Auf in Arabic.
I'd like you to have them.
There's really no need.  This is just a scrapbook.  I should feel obliged.  Thank you.
No.
All true.  Herodotus, your friend, tells of a wind - the Simoon - so evil that a nation declared war on it and marched out to fight it in full battle dress, their swords raised.
No, but I think I do.
I believe you still have my book.
That makes it harder still.
When were you least happy?
Marmite - addicted!  Baths - not with other people!  Islands.  Your handwriting.  I could go on all day.  My husband. AlmÃ¡sy nods.
A lie.  What do you hate most?
That day, had you followed me to the market?
I've watched you - on verandahs, at Garden Parties, at the Races - how can you stand there?  How can you ever smile?  As if your life hadn't capsized?
What?
I know.  I'm sorry.  I'll make a fire. I'll be back.
I'm just going to find things for the fire.
All the same, I, were I you I would be concerned -
Why are you people so threatened by a woman?!
AlmÃ¡sy - would you mind just spelling that for me?  What nationality would that be?
What did you do?
What's the matter with you?
What do we find in the desert? Arrow heads, spears.  In a war, if you own the desert, you own North Africa.
Own the desert.
Okay.
You're the prettiest girl I ever saw.
Would it? She kisses him, very softly, on the lips.
Thank you.
What do you want?
You were in Africa?
I'm okay.  Look, it's a big house. We needn't disturb each other.  I can shoot a pistol!  I'll sleep in the stables.  I don't care where I sleep.  I don't sleep.
Rabbit hunting.
You should be happy.  What were you going to do for him when it ran out? He pulls out more phials from his jacket.
For?
Yes, I got back there finally to keep my promise.  To come back for her. And then of course I couldn'tâ€ I couldn't even do that properly.
Well, she is!
Marzipan!  I think you've got marzipan in your hair.  No wonder you're homesick.
Thank you.
When my wife comes to lie down she always lays her garments one by one on a seat near the entrance of the room, and from where you stand you will be able to gaze on her at your leisureâ€
I can already see.
I can see my wife in that view.
Are you crazy?
Me?  He can't.  I'm already disturbed.
Do I recognize him?  I recognize what he is. I like him.  He's Canadian.  He can read Italian.  He can catch rabbits.
Sikh.  If he wears a turban, he's a Sikh.
My mother always told me I would summon my husband by playing the piano.
I don't think it does.  Anyway, he's indifferent to me.
Hey! -
You don't have any money, do you? Just in case there's silk.
Thank you.
Actually, you can't cut, can you? You'll fall over.  Give me the pliers.
Don't talk.  Check again.  Lie flat and then cut.
Then I'd think there must be a reason.
It's what I've learned.
I'll always go back to that church.
He can't even move.
Oh God.  Oh God.
Hello miss.
I think I might go inside and sit down for a few minutes.
No.
You tell me.  I remember a lot of things. I remember a garden, plunging down to the sea - the Devil's Chimney we called it - and there was a cottage at the bottom, right on the shore, nothing between you and France.
I think so.  Although I believe that to be true of a number of Germans. Might I have a glass of water?
Meaning no one arranges calalilies like that. He left the window open when he came in. His only mistake.
Yeah. Me.
How would you approach him? Hello, Mr. MacDougal, I'm Gin, would you steal a painting with me?
We're getting close.
Don't overestimate yourself.
Where are you at least?
Listen to me. Whatever you're doing, stop. Pull out.
A billion people speak Chinese. Don't be too impressed with yourself. As for that scroll, I can resell it for double. In 30 minutes.
Where did you hear that, one of those American talk shows?  Check, please.
Maybe the thief thought you had something valuable. You are in the business, that's what Roki says.
Roki has a vivid imagination.
Maybe you should go buy yourself some clothes.
If I can't trust you to pick up a painting, how can I trust you about the Mask?
Can you follow simple directions?
Got it.
Certainly not mine. Come on.
What's your problem? I'm doing the job.
I'm impressed. Can't spot a thing.
This isn't some Picasso print you steal out of a car dealer's rec room.
I drilled the bolts and went in through the window. It was the only way to bypass the smart glass.
No. It's a down payment.
Hmmm.
A dozen times.
So you had to be your own lifeline.
Popup, on floorboards. And--
A billion dollars.
Everything.
Guest lists of every A-list party on turnover night. They'd be handy to disappear into, so we're invited to all of them.
And the money goes--
Nope. The CD instructs the computer to replace those instructions with an innocuous loan coded XJ-6.
Packed.
Nothing like fear of drowning to focus your attention.
Brought us luck once, maybe it will again.
Hong Kong midnight, happy new year. Except at China Bank.
It's only ninety seconds up the line. You're on a connection to a trans Siberian express.
Gin, really.
Which is--
In the van.
We're going to need a vacuum with a battery pack for the dust. The air filters might be wired. And a bypass hose for the AC.
I need you to get one more thing for me. A dress, elegant but sexy, something Grace Kelly would wear. Maybe a Balenciaga.
You damn well thought wrong.
She reminds you of yourself. There's nobody you admire more.
It's never happened before. What makes you think it's happening now?
Faith is angels dancing on the head of a pin. I got to have trust.
You're giving them to me?
You got a real problem with priorities, you know that?
I'm gonna assume that was meant as a compliment, Anna, and just say thank you.
Thanks.  I'll keep it in mind.
Erin Brockovich.  Car accident.  Not her fault, she says.  And she looks like such an honest girl, don't you think?
Nothing you can't show up for with a stain.
So you say.
Usually, in adults, it's from exposure to bacteria or a virus or ...
Yeah, I'm real glad you brought that up.  I was going through your file here, and I ran into these medical records.  They kinda surprised me --
Thank you.  It's in remission now, thank the Lord, but you never know.  And then while that's going on, I end up having to have a hysterectomy.  Plus a whole mess of lumps removed from my breasts.  All benign so far, but still, no matter how positive you stay, an operation can still take it out of you.
The chromium.  Well, that's what kicked this whole thing off.
Right, but -- didn't you say he was paid by PG&E?
For what?
Well, then -- if you're feeling up to it, maybe we should talk shop.
... couldn't take painkillers cause they made me too groggy to take care of my kids.
Oh, please, it was long over by then.  God damn, he made me look like some cheap --
Bullshit.  You told me I'd get half a million dollars.  You told me I'd be set.
There's two things I can't stand, Mr. Masry. Being ignored, and being lied to.  You did both.
You said things would be fine, and they're not.
Oh.  Okay.  That's okay.
He wanted you to know the legal limit for hexavalent chromium, is .05 parts per million.  And that at the rate you mentioned, .58, it could be responsible for the cancers in that family you asked about. The Irvings.
Lemme see it, will you?
Because they can.  You heard that kid -- they have 28 billion dollars at their disposal.  They can afford to waste all the time in the world.
Bullshit.
Another raise wouldn't hurt.  And with all the time I'm gonna be spending on the road, I'll probably be needing my own cel phone, won't I?
They skipped that step.
I guess it was a little too inconvenient. So for fourteen years, this stuff flowed into the groundwater, free as you please.
Show me the document that proves that.
Really?  It makes me sick.
... but it won't cover Annabelle Daniels's medical bills.
Plus, 40 percent of 20 million's a whole lot of money.
Gee, I wonder why.
And, what, I'm not serious?
And if you had to guess ...
With nothing linking it to the corporate offices yet, I'd say we'll end up on the lower end of that.  Still a lot of money.
When?  Where?
Erin --
Erin?  What are you --
Oh, now don't get all jealous, Ed.  I got a little something for you, too.
"I can always find someplace else to work. Someplace that'll pay me a fortune and give me a view of the French Riviera ..."
I think we should makes some changes.
And ...?
Thank you very much.  Aren't you a gentleman?  Mr. ...
Ross.  Real pleased to meet you.  I'm Erin.
You just tell me what you want to look at and I'll be glad to dig 'em out for you.
Harmful, like -- how?  What would you get?
Yup.  They must be important, too, cause they came on a special plane.
We'll see.
You don't know six hundreds plaintiffs' numbers by heart.
Shit, yeah.  I got numbers coming out of my ears.  Like, for instance, ten.
Yeah?  And what do you do the rest of the time, live off your trust fund?
Then lemme remind you, the polite thing is to say, thank you, that's a real nice offer, I don't mind taking you up on it.
Yup.  Usually working on my bike.  No big deal.  If it doesn't work out, you can send 'em back to the chicken fat lady.
I guess we get what we pay for, huh?
No, see -- that's exactly what those arrogant PG&E fucks want me to think -- that because they got all this money and power, we don't stand a chance in hell against them.  But you know what?  They're wrong.
Lock the door.
What do you want to talk about instead? <u>Your</u> day?  That's a fascinating subject.
That's okay.  I understand.
What?
I moved payroll onto the computer.  It only knows to process paychecks for employees who log on in the morning and off at night.
Uh-huh?
I know.  But it's good for me.  Now I can help my daughter take care of my grandkids. And it's good for you, too.  Now you have money, you can find a good babysitter, huh? Not the old lady next door.
You did?
And code the signal to my private chamber.
Soon, Lord Vader.
Yes, Admiral .... soon.
This one I have watched a long time.  All his life has he looked away ... to the horizon, to the sky, to the future.  Never his mind on where he was, on what he was doing.  Adventure, excitement ...  A Jedi craves not these things!
No ... there is another.
But you cannot control it.  This is a dangerous time for you, Luke. You are now most susceptible to the temptations of the dark side.
You won't.
Okay, okay.
I'm sure I'll see you again, too. Keep well.  You'd better chain him until it's over.
The son of Skywalker.  You must destroy him ... or he will be our undoing.
He's not a Jedi, he's just a boy. Obi-wan could not have taught him so much that ...
Yes ... yes.  That would be a great asset.
Mistress Leia has been trying to reach you on the communicator, but either you have it turned off, or it is malfunctioning ... if it's damaged, Artoo, could fix it, if you like.
I do hope he's all there ... if you take my meaning.  I would hate to see Master Luke develop a short circuit ...
Does Luke know?
Me?  I don't know what you mean.
Now don't panic.  We don't know that.
I'll be surprised if we ever start moving.
Why?
There's nothing dull about a man I can depend on to be civilized.
Oh, so sorry!  Didn't mean to offend your droid.  You think braking and shutting down in that amount of time is easy?
That depends.  Where are we?
Look, sweetheart, I'm not going to have you accusing my friend of ...
No hard feelings?
He doesn't want you at all.  He's after someone named Skywalker.
You will find them well enough. But they must never again leave this city.
I forget nothing, Calrissian. Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.
There's not much chance, but the bounty hunter's ship is on the East Landing Platform.
What chance have we got in here? What are we going to do when they cut ...
Are the coordinates set?
What is it?
That's just great.  Why doesn't everyone just take off?
He'll survive.
To become a Jedi takes the deepest commitment, the most serious mind.
You will be, my young one.  Heh. You will be.
No!  No different!  The differences are in your mind.  Throw them out! No longer of use are they to you.
My mind fills with so many images.
You'll find I'm full of surprises.
And I too.
I'll die first.
Yes, Sir .... we have visuals ... the System is supposed to be devoid of human forms ...
I want that ship.
My name is Cornelius.  And this is Zira -- my wife.
I don't believe it.
Keep him in cold storage till the reports in.  Then send him to Taxidermy.  He's a museum piece.
It's a strain of the Plutoxin 7 virus. Genetically engineered. 100% pure death. Complete nervous system shutdown. You crash and bleed out like a stuck pig. Not a pretty sight.
Go on now. Do as I say.
You're my woman, you understand? You don't let anybody take you away from me without a fight.
Where?
We have a little arrangement. Anything happens to me, you're dead.
Cuervo Jones has more firepower than two armies. No one gets near him.
No, that sucks.  How are we getting out?
If I'm late, Carjack, don't start without me.
So what's the deal, huh? Go into L.A., find the President's daughter, secure the box, and bring 'em both out - and I'm free?
Where's the submarine? It's disappeared off our screens.
Yeah, I got it.
Cuervo's got a place near Venice, where the big birds fly. Nice digs, too. I've been there, y'know.
Cease fire with the bullshit.
If he lets you get close enough.
Hershe. She lives downtown with Mojo Dellasandro in the big boat. Down that way.
Are you crazy?
They live here, used to be like us. But after too many silicon implants, their muscles turned to jelly. The only way they survive is to have body parts transplanted over and over again.  Snake, nobody who comes into Beverly Hills gets out alive.
I don't know. Somehow, I just can't leave.
Thank God.
--Take Excalibur. Find a pool of calm water and throw the sword into it.
--By itself it is only a piece of steel. Its power comes from he who wields it. For now there is no one. Do as I have ordered!
I will not.
Speak of the devil!...
You know full well there is, and I go to meet it now. Come witness my revenge.
A king should be afraid, always. The enemy is everywhere. Waiting in ambush in the dark corridors of his castle, on the deer paths of his forest, or in the gray and winding paths of a more tangled forest, in here.
Me? I have lived by the oath of king and knight.
Not you, my husband?
Because you and the land are one.
There is one.
Who?!
Love demands it.
Listen, boy, it's more than twenty days from here.
I'm not jealous!
No. Yes, I am. I am jealous. I want to write poems about you with moonbeams, make the sea sing your name...
Why it's perfectly plain, your the teacher at the college, you don't want the building torn down.
C'mon I can read for Christ sake.
And what about the exorcist? Any ideas?
Dinner at the White House.
Just five or six people.
Maybe the circuit is busy?
Of course I didn't.
You were expecting a deliver y that day?
Uh huh. 'Fraid so.
Yes, I go now.
Lies?
You're kidding! Like what?
She used those words?
The shaking of the bed, that's doubtless due to musuclar spasms.
That's okay. I should've told you I wouldn't be in uniform.
If a person was possessed by a demon of some kind, how do you go about getting an exorcism?
Oh yeah, since when?
To begin with it could make things worse.
But how?
Like what?
Um........Stuff.
Really, what kind was it a mair or guilding?
When can I have one?
You know how?
Captain Howdy.
Well what would you like to do? Got any ideas?
Yeah, don't stop. Keep going.
I stole it.
I believe you.
I get passes. In fact I got a pass for The Crest tomorrow night. Would you like to go?
You might loosen the straps then.
That's much to vulgar a display of power Karras.
Intensely.
It would bring us together.
Quod nomen mihi est?
La plume de ma tante.
Momma I can take you somewhere to a place where you wouldn't be alone. There'd be people around, you know you won't have to sit here listening to the radio.
And let my cry come unto thee.
... upon this your servant, Regan Teresa MacNeil.
Maybe somebody crazy, someone with a spite against the church, some unconscious rebellion, perhaps.
Very much.
I get passes to the best shows in town. Mrs. K though, she gets tired and never likes to go.
Fuck him!!!
We want to see Mrs. Karras.
Are you a relative?
Is there someone inside you?
I don't know.
Is it Captain Howdy?
Why not?
I'm afraid.
Mondays.
Take it now.
Vacation?  Christ, Charlie, it's a Monday night. You said so yourself.
Suit yourself.
Frank.
How will he eat?
Start him out on cottage cheese. If you've got him on kibble, just soak it a few minutes.  Go down like pudding through a hot pipe.
Two nights.
Huh?
Fuck him.  Great.  Terrific.  Fuck him.
Try the black Knable.
Funny.  Strike a bell?
No thanks.
No, I mean it.
Yeah.  Listen ... come out to the house tomorrow, will ya?
We don't get a gig.
What're you talking about?
Terrific.
That how you see it?
I'll drop the eighths.
You're a fucking alarm clock.
Jack, for crying out loud.  Your bachelorhood's showing.  Ah, here we go.
All right, but if you change your mind, let me know.  I gotta go get Ma in the morning anyway.
Two years ago.  March.
Last?
Unless you want the right.
No, you take the right.
I just figure things'll go smoother, you know, if we have it all worked out from the beginning.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think what Mr. Daniels is trying to say, Jack, is --
No, that's your problem, Frank.  You get around one of these assholes and you turn into a fucking three-year-old.
No! I never hear it!  Maybe.  Sometimes.  I don't know. But I won't let it bother me.
Because I can hear it.
What?
How long you been at it?
Time flies, huh?
No, you're wrong.  It's just beginning. Come on, have a drink. Show your big brother how it's done.
I always think of him on New Year's. How he used to pour us each half a can of beer. Remember?
Yeah, and you drank yours like it was orange juice. He loved that about you.
What channels it on?
Basketballs, Frank.  You had us playing for basketballs.
No.
Daughter's.  Sweet sixteen.
Christ, that's right.  How could I forget.  What a nightmare.
Thrilling.  Both of you.
And if she asks what it's about, don't tell her. She's opposed to my career.
Candy Man.'  Is that all right?
It's one of Jack's favorites.
What do you mean?
My watch is broken, too.
Impersonally.
So if I'm so 'late how come you're still here?
What are we, an orchestra all of a sudden?
What I mean is --
Hey!
A seven.
Piece of cake.
We are not a saloon act.  We do not take tips from dirty old men.
I was gonna split it with you guys.
The Carlton's a dump.  No cover.  No minimum. And they water their drinks. It's strictly for the Fuller brush crowd.
Baker's unabridged.
Great.
People.' You think Streisand, right? Hot that night.  Chills. Through the whole audience.  I could hardly play.
They must've bought the same map we did.
I don't believe it.  You're a romantic, Frank.
Well then ... shall we?
You want to tell me what the hell's going on?
What're you talking about?  They love it.
Yes, well, they are.
Is that important?
Uh, well, you know, the way our schedule is, I thought maybe...
Thanks.
I mean, I'd hate to think I'd pick up someone who wore that shit.
Baker.  Jack Baker.
Regular hours are eight to five.
Yeah.
Because Blackie Carson books the Park and whenever we've needed a gig he's come through.
It's a shitty  song.
What'd I say?
Nothing.
You were good.
Yeah, they got a convention for everything. At least he was clean.  Boy, the guys I met when I was with the service, you wouldn't believe.  The older ones, they were okay.  Nice.  Polite.  Pulled the chair out for you.  But the younger ones ...  Mama used to say, dance with a man once, but if you can feel calluses on his fingers, don't dance with him again.  She thought she had it all figured out. But she wasn't so smart.  There are killers with palms like a baby.
No kidding?
You sending me home?
Wow.  But I still don't see how ...
We outgrew each other.
Terrific.  I'm doing vegetables next week.
No.
Eddie did.
Oh?
That's what I want to do. I want to make a snowman.
You look great, Castor. Really.  Here -- I got a shot of your favorite -- Mescal.  Even has the worm.
The last time I took orders from you I ended up with five years probation.
She's only 12.  Some day she'll understand that apathy and absence are just special ways of saying "I love you."
Is that what you think?
I can't tell you ... except only I can do it.
Eve, listen carefully.  The man you think is your husband -- isn't.
What more proof do you need?
Don't worry.  I've done my homework.  I'll get Pollux to talk.
What're you gonna do with me gone?  You'll drive your wife and kid nuts! I bet your daughter is just about ripe by now. What's her name, Janie?
Too late, your kid worships me.  And your wife -- she's an animal.  Even I can't keep up with her.
Not if I kill you first ...
I'm going to have you fired.
What's the matter with your voice, Commander?
I won't tell mom if you don't.
You mean like ... condoms?
You always call me Miss Brewster.
Get rid of them.
D.C.'s very high on giving you the promotion.  There's just one problem.
What is it, Admiral? I'm under the gun here.
They say love is blind. Do you think that's true?
Isn't that what all this is about?  Letting Jamie go out, cooking me dinner, -- your next assignment?
I'm replacing Lazarro. Nice, safe desk job -- just like you wanted.
-- Yes.
Wait a second -- you hated Madonna.  Didn't you?
Kate Reynolds was my girlfriend in college.  I almost married her...
God, no.  I thought about it for practically the entire flight...
Adelle?
You were supposed to be here half an hour ago...the emergency strategy session? Your trip to Aspen? Theyâ€™re all panicked here...
I don't know.  Maybe...
Is this another one of those Sun Tzu â€œArt of Warâ€ tricks?
Thatâ€™s right.  Okay, letâ€™s make a quick stop at the kidsâ€ shoe department, pick up my watch from the battery place, then Iâ€™ll run into the linen store...
Who did?
The aliens...In the mother ship.  You look just like him.
On a case by case basis...
Like what?
No, honey. Go back to sleep.
I donâ€™t think so.
Itâ€™s just two kids, right?
Itâ€™s your birthday? Today?  Whatâ€™s your name?  Where were you born?
Yes, thatâ€™s it...yes, we went to high school together.
You never really talked to me.  I wanted to talk to you, man...
Yeah...I guess I just wanted you to know, we couldâ€™ve been really good friends...
Iâ€™ve got all the time in the world...
Yes you do...
Wow.  It must be great being you.  You got it all.
Thatâ€™s my car!  You stole my car!
Basically, itâ€™s my car now.  Get in.
You?  What about me?  Iâ€™m working hard for you here, Jack.  On Christmas too!  Now you did a good thing last night, intervening that way.  I was moved...
Why not?
Look Jack, in my experience the best way people deal with this is to just relax and breathe through it...let it come to you.
Ticket bad.  You draw in lines with pencil.
Get out!
Okay, chief.
About the plane? What do you think itâ€™s gonna crash? Donâ€™t say that...
Believe me I know what an incredible opportunity this is for you...
Yeah...fine.
Pro bono.  You donâ€™t get paid at all.  Nobody makes a dime.  Well, bravo...
And...?
Itâ€™s ten thirty, Jack. By eleven youâ€™re gonna be sprawled out on the bed snoring your head off. We donâ€™t have time for wining and dining.
Itâ€™s an unbelievable thing.  Wearing this suit actually makes me feel like a better person.  Iâ€™m gonna buy it...
Itâ€™s good, right?
Whatâ€™s the difference? Iâ€™m taking my baby out for our anniversary, damn the costs...
But Iâ€™m gettinâ€ close, right?
Itâ€™s wonderful...
Way out...
A perk for what?
What are you talking about, Jack?
Jack, what could you possibly be thinking? What about my job?
No, this is the center of the universe.  If I were living in Roman times, I would live in Rome, where else?  Today, America is the Roman Empire and New York is Rome itself. John Lennon.
Youâ€™ve been Jack Campbell.  And thatâ€™s always a good thing...
Hello Jack.  You donâ€™t have to stop singing on my account...
I need you, tiger..
Not exactly. Iâ€™ve seen you on CNBC.  You look taller in real life...
Youâ€™re a little tougher, Peter.
Okay, Iâ€™ll take them...
Hey, are you okay?
I'm taking the train...
Christmas?  It canâ€™t be Christmas...
Maybe itâ€™s by the wardrobe boxes...
This ain't permanent.  My friend Reed's working on a cure...I think.
He's made a few changes.
He's smart, powerful, successful --
O-kay.  We'll skip that question.
Just get back soon, or I start looking for a new groom.
Don't come any closer for a sec.  This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
I already got it.  Everything I want.
It's not him.  It's <u>them</u>.  I can't live like this.
I though we went over this.
Keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool!
Is that what you call it?  "<i>Real</i>"?
Yes sir.  You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
Ben's still out there --
<u>Ben</u> did this?
I was talking about us.  Working together.
Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll.  You remember my brother Johnny...
Great minds think alike.
That's good.  That's uh...good.
Anger.  Rage.  Frustration.
No, I distinctly remember: <u>you</u> walked out <u>my</u> door.  Ergo...
No way to know.  Without more tests, experiments.
I'm sure I can come up with something.
Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he <u>likes</u> having his prize specimen under glass...  It's ironic, isn't it?  You're finally the perfect woman for him...because you're his <u>science project</u>.
Skeptical...?
We understand your concern, but we've made our decision, Doctor. Any questions? Anybody?
Phase Two.
Before he could breathe a word. He's the only scientist who knows the answer to what we're after. That's why we have to operate --
<Me>?
Grant, our Miniaturizer can shrink anything.
Where can I get a cab back to town?
I don't agree. Just because he's often difficult --
We'll know -- in the next breath...
We must!
I'll take some Laughing Gas, ma'am.
Oh yes, I'm sure Dr. Duval could. If we had the parts.
I can't till the hatch is flooded!
Oh, no. Plenty of cause. He won't follow the herd, or change his convictions -- even when they're not popular. And he believes in an absolutely free interchange of information between scientists of different countries -- and these days, there's nothing more suspicious than that.
You can't believe all that's accidental? That there isn't a Creative Intelligence at work --
I'm going to do what I can to save Benes.
If I can relieve the pressure on a few key vessels...
Well, we better get on with it.
That line was tampered with...
It's possible --
Go ahead.
Could I run a tube through that Wall, without harming Benes?
I could use a lawnmower...
Was there any damage?
What do you mean?
Fuck you, man! Where's Jerry? I gave SIMPLE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS -
Drop that fucking money!
You're required to display temporary tags, either in the plate area or taped inside the back window.
Have ya been to the Celebrity Room before? With other, uh, clients?
We split that.
I'm not gonna sit here and debate. I will say this though: what Shep told us didn't make a whole lot of sense.
You want your own wife kidnapped?
Personal matters.
Okay, Jerry. You're tasking us to perform this mission, but you, you won't, uh, you won't - aw, fuck it, let's take a look at that Ciera.
Oh, Jean's okay. But there's three people up in Brainerd who aren't so okay, I'll tell ya that.
What the heck d'ya mean?
The heck d'ya mean? What a you guys got yourself mixed up in?
Any others?
So he says, 'So I get it, so you think I'm some kinda jerk for askin',' only he doesn't use the word jerk.
I unnerstand.
First one's a trucking company, second one's a private residence.  A Shep Proudfoot.
Uh-huh.
Yah?
Uh-huh.
It's okay, Scotty. They're not gonna want to hurt her any.  These men, they just want money, see.
but do you know that for sure without -
Ma'am, I answered your question.  I answered the darn - I'm cooperating here, and I...
Thank you, hon. How's Fargo?
Yah, real good.
Yah, so we're all set.
No, fax is no good, that's what I have and I can't read the darn thing -
I mean send it over. I'll shoot it right over to ya.
Circumstances have changed, Jerry.
Well... I'm goin' ta bed now.
Whatcha watchin' there?
Norstars.
Jean and Scotty never have to worry.
...Huh?
Yah.
No! No cops! That's final! This is my deal here, Wade! Jean is my wife here!
Ah, dammit!
Well, yah, but he had a buddy there. He, uh -
Well, I don't vouch for him.
Call 'em up.
Yah, well, see, I did that, and I haven't been able to get 'em, so I thought you maybe'd know an alternate number or what have ya.
Let's go take a look at that trooper.
Oh...
Yah, that's a good one.
Yah.
Well, how the heck are ya?
Yah, if you're an engineer, yah, you could do a lot worse. Of course, it's not, uh, it's nothin' like your achievement.
Now, I saw some rough stuff on your priors, but nothing in the nature of a homicide...
Margie Olmstead?
But we still haven't found Gustafson.
We've got a -
Copy. Yah, send me back-up!
Yah, Menominie only has Chief Perpich and he takes February off to go to Boundary Waters.
You bet. Thanks for lunch. What do we got here, Arbie's?
They're real good.
Yah, ya think?
Yah, I guess.
We called his house; his little boy said he hadn't been there.
He's at -
He was killed serving Project Mayhem.
Yes.  We're men.  Men is what we are.
Strangers with this kind of honesty make me go a big rubbery one.
Bob, Bob... I'm a member.
Here are your flight coupons.  Call me from the road if there are any snags.  Your itinerary...
You don't get paid to abuse the copy machine.
Pretend you're me.  You find this. What would you do?
I Am Jack's Complete Lack of Surprise.
This is... really a shock...
Who do you think could've done this?
You need healthy, natural sleep. Chew valerian root and get some more exercise.
Sure.
You take tuberculosis.  My smoking doesn't go over at all.
You're kidding.
Okay.  I'll take blood parasites and organic brain dementia --
Let's not make a big thing out of it.
Marla?
Don't worry, I'm leaving.
There?
You mean, you want to know if I think we were just having sex or making love?
What?
Well... let me see... here's the thing...
You were in here last Thursday night.
My suitcase was vibrating?
Now, find your power animal.
Somehow, I realize all of this -- the gun, the bombs, the revolution -- is really about Marla Singer.
The spork.  I get it.  You're very clever.
How's that working out for you?
Delivered from armchairs in obscure green stripe patterns.
A hotel?
Can I stay at your place?
What's that?
I don't want to die without any scars.  How much can you really know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?  Come on... you're the only person I've ever asked.
What fight?
Anyone.
He was setting up franchises.  My father never went to college, so it was really important that I go.
Shatner.  William Shatner.
Good answer.
No.  Not at all.
Promise?
No, what you're feeling is premature enlightenment.
Homework assignment.
You're asking questions that don't have answers.  You know just as much about Project Mayhem as anybody else.
Why do people think I'm Tyler Durden?
You have jobs.
She's... you... you're fucking her.
...stop me?
I'm not going...
...to let this happen!
If you know, I know.
Green?  Did you say green?
Fuck your struggle.  I want out.
What?
Defuse the bomb, please.
Defuse the bomb?
Yes.
Paraffin.
Please understand... I've gotten all I can from this, Tyler.
Well, sir, you said you might.
But, in Project Mayhem, we have no names.
Irvine?  Irvine's at home with a broken collarbone.
Ain't that something?
Look, stupid fuck, I want everyone outta here now!
"Stuff."  Were the mid-terms hard?
I... I don't know...
I thought...I thought you might be able to help me.
Death's list.  The precise order you're going to die in.
The songs on the radio.  But wait.  I don't understand.  Why is this even happening to me?
I hope you're ready for this.
No, it's not here.  This one was different.  More like the pile up and the van going into the lake.
Yes.  I was in a hospital.  There was screaming... A nurse was choking me.  I couldn't tell what she looked like, but the name tag was right in my face.  Kalarjian.
If only Alex and I had done that with the others, Alex might still be...
Being alive after our time caused an outward ripple - a rift in Death's design.
Yeah, I hate to love and leave ya, but I've been over this X-Files shit since the sixth season.
But why single me out?  What am I in the great scheme of things?  You'd think I stepped off Flight 180 or something... Fucking weird, man.
I never mad it.  The Greyhound bus I was on splattered some chick all over the road and we had to stop.
Like what?
Evan Shaeffer's dead.
Clean up?  I don't...
I know.  I can feel it too.
No, I'm good.
I can live with thaaaa --
Highway to Hell, Highway to Hell.
What if Tod... is just the first... of us?
They blame me for everything. Her, Tod, the plane crash...
That's why It skipped Carter and went to the next one in the path of the explosion; Billy.
No! No! Don't!
You get off havin' control over me. Let me choose how to deal with it.
You're the fuckin' devil.
Of course not! Gods aren't afraid to die! Gods don't die! We do!
Because of you, I gotta sit here and watch fuckin' "Stepmom."
That's a plan.
Did you take any sedatives before boarding, or on the plane. Sleeping pills?
"Next?"
Oh, you've noticed it, too?
Why would he pull at the wire if he were committing suicide?
Billy! I'm gettin' a vision!  You're the next one...
They're watching me, see if I go to Alex.
Huh?
Star Wars?
There's the Mekong.
Clown?  Now back up there, buddy...
Modified M-16 A2 and over-under M-79 grenade launcher, with Sionics sound suppressor, Tracor starlight scope and LAC/R-100 Laser sighting system.
Exactly.
Sometimes they do.  They're river pirates.  Opium runners.
I need a vacation.
Let me see.
You never been in one of those things.
Hold your pantyhose.  Here, gimme a hand.
It's a Soviet MIL MI-24.  Probably has 12.7mm nose cannon, heat-seeking rockets and wire guided missiles, plus...
I thought he was with you.
Spooks?
Minigun.  Come on.  Let's move. He's coming in on our open side.
It doesn't hurt.  Why doesn't it hurt?
Sorry, Sir.
I'm not jumping blind.
Negative.  Absolutely not.  The phase two assault team will get them out.
Sir, there's something else... a TRANSAT relay.  Just came through.
Nice work.
It's not necessary.
Not my people.
This mission was a scam from the word go?
Those men are all dead.
Plus, what else?  Two Silver Stars, four Bronze Stars, two Soldier's Medals, four Vietnamese Crosses of Gallantry and... uh, a handful of Purple Hearts.
Five.  I never wanted that stuff.
What did you want?
I say we tape him to a chair.
Keep it clean, Rambo, or I'll nail your hide to the shed.
Yeah, well... suicidal paranoiacs say funny things sometimes.
You didn't kill anybody.  Stop.
He just needs some clothes?
"I'm an incredible woman?"  What is this, a death sentence?
Huh-huh....You son of a bitch!
But..How could that happen?
You'd have the option to care for him at home but my advice is it wouldn't be the best thing for him. He needs hospital care. I just thought you could sign the release forms, but the city can do that. I wouldn't feel responsible in any way. There's really nothing you can do. I'm sorry.
Uh...Where...where do you want to go?
I... I was just leaving.
... First time in my life I'll be a voice with a body.  Do you know what that means?  What this could lead to?
Jack, it's a sitcom -- you're not defining Pi.
How un-sixties of you.
All of them... Which means <u>you</u> have just won a free membership at our store on Second Avenue.
Great place huh?
Sshhhh!
The Little People?
They said you're The One.
But I need help and <u>they</u> sent you.
God... I'm the janitor of God.
Oh, please... you're embarrassing me.
I know...
Fifty dollars?
I take it back - you're fucking deranged... And you're going to get yourself killed trying to get in there!
Tch. You are so sweet...Now I know why you're saying this. ...You're afraid I'm in danger and you're trying to protect me.
WHO! WHO'S RUNNING?!! WHO HAVE WE BEEN CHASING!?? CAN I ASK THIS QUESTION NOW!!!
OWW...MAN...
I don't like horror movies!
Yeah.
Why does it sound exciting? There's absolutely nothing exciting about it.
No, I'm not mad at you, hand. It'll be all right. Just spot and follow through...
Okay. Hope no one hits on you.
Do you love me, Bobby?
I have to see how things are first. My father's sick, you understand? They wouldn't be prepared for me bringing anyone.
No, let's go...
I saw a picture of it. Alaska is very clean. It appeared to look very white to me... Don't you think?
Yeah. That's before the big thaw.
No, but it was very clever... I would of just punched her out.
Well, you seem very professional...
Don't, then.
I have to talk seriously with you...
No...
Uhm hmm.
I'm not. He does walk funny. Don't you see that?
Sailors are sadistic, I feel.
That's right. Have you anything to suggest?
Then after that?
Tomorrow's a full practice day...  But the day after is kind of open.
Thank you.
Something witty and devastating like that.
I'm fine.
Carl restored my confidence. He really did. He's much more substantial than you give him credit for.
What?
Oh. You have to tell me that.
Yes.
What?
Well, I was goin' to, but Bobby said he hadda kind of feel things up here first, which I can understand, but then it went an' took so long, I ran flat outa money...  I didn't have no number to call, you know.  So I hadda clear outa there an' come on up here, in the hopes that I wouldn't be intrudin' myself...
Oh, uh huh. I had a little kittycat once, that Bobby give me...
Don't call me "mack," honey.
The TV. There's some good things on it, sometimes.
Why you have an attitude for?
So get the fuck outta here.
Victor.
Hi.
I just wanted to see you.
Of course.
How you treat them?
I'm not goin' to 10th Street, people piss and shit in that pool,
Pitt.
C'mon.
She lives near Eddie?
Near Natasha's? Or over by Boy's Club?
Your friend must be misinformed.
Yo, I know what you're thinking, that I'm one of those guys that keep coming up to her.
Wha'?
Jus' from around the way.
Yeah.
You gotta girLfrLend?
We'd have no way of knowing that, sir.
You don't have to run with me, Crease.
I busted their window, they didn't do anything.
'Your men' might just be involved in all this.
You idiot. Off the record, deep background: I've got that beach crawling with undercover cops.
I'm no lawyer, but I do believe that's a violation of my rights.
Can I ask anybody now?
What'll it be Fletch?
That's Babar.
Two bs?
But not right next to each other. I thought that's what you meant.
Arnold Babar. Isn't there a children's book about an elephant named Babar?
I don't know. I don't have any.
He was in intensive care for eight weeks.
Yes, but the very end, when he actually died, that was extremely sudden.  You know, Alan and I were recently speaking of dying. Told me Boyd Aviation took out a lot of insurance on him. You must have to be in some kind of perfect health to get that kind of policy.
For me. I'm a reporter, Sam. I'm breaking the drug story and I got the chief red-handed. Gummy gave me a deposition.
You don't have a piece of the action?
You're in the Records Room.
Yes, right away.
It stinks. I thought woman were independent now.
I empathize with your plight, Fletch. However, you threw her out.
Found it in a cab. That's a grand. Apply the difference to next month.
Till then.
Ahem.  'Sally Ann can confirm all this when the police pick her up at the Airport Marriott.'
That's right. Alan comes by every three weeks or so.
Boy, what the hell's the matter with you?
Gee, I must have been shit-faced at your wedding, I don't --
Maybe, Fletch. Is that Brazil?
I want you to murder me.
I've got fifty thousand dollars says you will.
Sometimes yes, sometimes no. The staff usually forgets.
So it looks like a burglary attempt. You catch me. I get the gun, and shoot you.
What do you say, Mr. Nugent? You'll be doing me and my family a great service.
Married Boyd Aviation. He's no dummy, that's serious coin.
'Stanwyk's parents, Marvin and Velma Stanwyk, also of Provo, were unable to attend the wedding.'
Only one way to find out.
Yeah.
Nothing to it.
You've met her?
Oh, personal stuff. Look! I hit one!
Hi.
I mean put clothes on.
Can I ask you a question?
What is this?
I think you should call me Gail, now.
Great. I'll have a Bloody Mary and a steak sandwich.
What?
I'm her cousin.
Tell the cops.
Oh, I hate it when he calls me that.
I have pictures of him. Dealing...
How gray?
You know, I've had it up to here with your bullshit. I need a story from you by tomorrow.
I want something I can print!
Their statements, naming Chief Cummings as the numero uno drug pusher from here to Oxnard. I want them to have federal protection under the paper's sponsorship.
Nuthin'.
Colleen and Johnny, sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g...
Thanks for the information. Appreciate it.
Car insurance costs money. Cavities cost money.  Doritos cost money.  I'm gonna eat that damn bear... come here!
I love you, too, baby.  He wants to meet at six.  What time is it now?
Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
Ms. Sutton hired you to find the girl.  Period.
Yeah, let's bury her.
I've always said the one reason I'm the best detective in the industry is that I'm the only one... but hey, I never throw away a clue...
You're not funny.
Hey, they blew me.
Oh.  Three hundred coming right up.
I don't know.  I'm so scared. Help me.
Peachy.
Come again?  B.FL.D., I have sex with rock stars; it's not like I'm doing something that I don't enjoy with them, like shuffleboard. Don't worry about me, I practice safe sex and next summer, I'm going to U.C.L.A.
Ye-ah.
You wish.  Come on, let's get outta here.
ArtArtArtArtMooneyMooneyMooney Mooney.
Why am I what?  Excuse me?  I catch you saying the F-word again.  I'll kill you.  That's a fucking promise.  Now get the fuck out of here.
Forget it.
Jesus, how could you be so stupid?  Come on, we're going to a hospital.
Liar!  You don't care!  About anything.
Who's my real father, man?
Shut the heck up... Pop.
What's fine?
<u>I.  Am.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.</u> <u>In.  The.  Whole.  Fucking.  World</u>.
The point?
Ciao.
Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
What?
I'm clean.
Doesn't register.
No, nothing.  There's only some talk.
Well try, okay?
What?
My friend, I am not sure about what is going on -- but for me, I am finished.
You must take me for an imbecile. Why do you think I asked you to meet me in Washington?  I haven't spent five minutes in New York City without the company of a gendarme.
Formidable!  Sans toi je m'habillerais encore en docker.  Je suis passÃ© voir FranÃ§oise.
Une erreur!  C'est gÃ©nial.  C'est une vedette Ã  la tÃ©lÃ©vision.  Il peut aller partout sans Ãªtre soupÃ§onnÃ©... En plus il a besoin de fric.
J'ai pas confiance en lui.
Who financed it?
You're for real?
We have four rooms and six suites on six.  There's a man in almost every one of them.
Yeah, I know.
Not a chance.
Drink this.
Make it Alexander's, I like the toy department.
This could be it, Walter.  This Candy Store guy, putting on a big show in a fancy nightclub with known connections all over him. Then on our own, after working the whole day and night, we tail him out to Brooklyn and sit on him for a week practically, and who do we come up with?  Joel Weinstock.  You gotta let us have it.
Third time around.
Can you use a new suit for Christmans?
What was it?
You go to Xavier High School, Daryl?
You're shitting me!
One way to find out.
Nothing.  I just wanted to see you.
Wish you weren't.
I know.  He loves that thing.
No.  Not our Johnny.  I mean, it's Johnny...but not now...in the future.
Let's go.  Do us both a favor.
What if I told you that in the bottom of the 6th we're gonna be down 3-0.  And Cleon Jones is gonna get hit in the foot. It's gonna leave a scuff mark on the ball.
Get him home safe.
I'll be up soon, Little Chief.
Listen, you can't broadcast without a license.  Unless this is an emergency, you gotta get off the band.
Huh?
What'd you just say?
Yeah...I think so.
Too busy playin' ball, huh?
I'm trying to be, Dad.  I'm tyrin'.  It's good to hear your voice.  I missed you...so much.
I think I'm losing you.
It did, Pop.  It did.
Chief?!  Is that you?
What it was like when you died in the fire...
I don't know...  What about the other women?
Well they found out cigarettes give you lung cancer.
Yeah, I think so...
Yes it is...we did this.  We changed everything.  I've been having bad dreams, Johnny. Dreams where I die...in the fire.  I was supposed to die in that warehouse.
Johnny, I know, but...
What?
Listen to me, very carefully, take your wallet out, just touch it on the corners.
Please, Dad, just do it.
Call the FBI.  Use a pay phone.  Don't give 'em your name, Dad.  Just tell 'em that it was Shepard who killed Finelli and Clark and the others.  That he's the Nightingale.
Dad, you there?
The warehouse.  Buxton seeds.  It's tomorrow.
I know pal.  I remember.  Twenty-nine years tomorrow.
Fire?  What are you talking about?  He had cancer, John.
You got a deal, mister.  I mean Santa.
She made up her mind.  Nothin' I do is gonna change it.
Gordo, I wasn't dreaming.  I talked to him, it was real.
Ten?  No.  I remember this case.  Three. He killed three women.
What're you talking'?  You know better than anybody, John.  You've read this file a thousand times.
What?
So how are things at the hospital?
I did?!  I broke the world's record.
If you insist.
I'll think of something.
This is all the exercise I need...
Have you ever made love in a hammock?
Hello.  How are you?
Is that so bad?
No.  I can look around by myself. I'll take the upstairs.
I'm here with you.  Can't that be enough for now?
You're the boss.
I have to.
I do like you.  But not when you act like a jerk.
Why?
Of course not.  If he hasn't already accidentally pelleted himself, I'm sure he's lost.
This is a man's game.  Requiring a man's cunning and intelligence...
How do you know?  Did you take his temperature?
You watch that smart-mouthing, young lady.
'Cause it stinks.
Come and get it.
No, he was real.  Like on TV.
Eight times.  They've burned him, dipped him in nuclear waste --
Yeah, that'd be a big shame...
Skin stretcher was human.
You know he's not...and he's coming for you.
You food'll be right out.
It's going.
Do you have to ask?
It's...It's all right.
Okay.
'Night, Josh.
I know who you are and the last thing we need around here is some freak show "bounty hunter" making trouble. I want you outta town and I want you outta town now!
Tell me!
Information like that is very expensive and you don't have the balls to pay the price.
I was going to, I was going to tell everyone.  I just...didn't expect to be back here so soon.  Is Steven around?
Is this Anthony?...Yeah, well, I just have one question for you, Anthony -- did you fuck my dog?
Randy, c'mon!
She asked me to come over.  She said she had something to tell me.
She did have a miscarriage, didn't she?  Didn't she?!
Oh, you stupid, sorry son-of-a- bitch...
A pizza?!
I'm sure we'll have no problem getting them to party with us...especially with this.
It's not that, it's just that...  It I get caught, I'll lose my science scholarship and everything.
But...wait a minute!
Nothing.
Never mind, you don't want to know about it.
There's nothing to worry about, Suzy. The guy's dead now, somewhere at the bottom of this lake...if you believe the stories.  Let's drop it, okay?
And I'll never do it again. Forgive me?
The fire alarm...
We have to get off this ship!!
Then I'll make sure you remain on board while your classmates see the sights.
He's the son of the Captain, for Chrissakes. You'd think he'd be able to operate this thing!
Nothing! I went to her cabin and...
A wonderful choice of places to dock a boat, Mr. Robertson.
Am I? Let's find out.
I'm the one you should be listening to! Do you think dropping an anchor in the middle of a storm makes any sense whatsoever?
You can and you will!!
Me too. But I'm not sure Uncle Charles will be.
You let me worry about him, okay?  Personal experiences are what fuel the minds of great writers, Rennie. You made the right decision.
Maybe not. But you're not telling me everything, are you?
Is your ship equipped with Omega satellite navigation or LORAN?
Give me the degrees first, followed by minutes and sec...
Hi, Sean.
Is the ship going to sink??
Where you're going, mister?
What did you find?
Big mess every time.
I drove twelve hours straight through. Ate at the wheel.
Quietly effective.
Don't talk like that.
That sounds so final. But are we really surprised?
Don't needle me, Elliot. Tell me how bad you feel. We're suppose to feel bad together. This is what friends do.
You used to love life. You don't exude this any more.
It is just a review. Do not inhale. Very dangerous.
Do not inhale.
`The most interesting thing about Elliot Litvak is that he writes the way he looks -- fuzzy, grubby and shifty-eyed.'  I'm telling you as a friend.
Unbelievable.
Yes. What are you implying?
Let's work on it.
This could be it.
This could be it.
I hear Alan's sick.
She's dying.
Can he get through it?
They'll lose because they're my team.
Is it?
You're too young to be studying criminal behavior. It's making you obsessive.
Your mother and I have something between us that's too strong to damage permanently. Believe me, I know this. That's right, nineteen years. And what about the days and minutes? Sharing small moments, sharing memories, raising a beautiful child. We're wedded in the deepest and strongest ways. Lillian isn't only my wife. She's my best friend.
I didn't turn her into Mother. You did.
I have a class. I'm late.
Joanne Bourne.
I don't know if I can say that.
Go way. I'll call a cop.
Pop, will you let me in?
It was rummy, not poker. But I'll take a chance and let you in.
Lillian says it once a week. `Why doesn't he come live with us?'
You're Frankie Lazzaro. The gangster from Rhode Island.
This is one charming crook. If shooting people is charming.
Now that's a complicated subject.
What am I doing?
An how many years does it take a person to make his family safe and secure and happy, and then in one dumb moment, what does he do?
If you believed, you wouldn't be walking around with a handgun in your belt. What does that tell me? You want to make the night come down.
Washed away.
It's a test all right. They're bringing in Stanley.
Yes.
But my parasite is consuming all the new memories. Eating my lines.
You have to see the words. Try to build a mental picture of the script. Imagine your lines high- lighted with a felt tip pen.
Yes.
I was in the fish-market play. What happened to him?
So do I. Over and over.
Steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy. No friends. No phone.
Sort of. Sometimes. You're not building an obsession about Steven, are you? Look. I understand opening- night jitters, but you've got one of the great actors in American theater starring in your play.
I'm going home to my machine.
"I will follow you in all our vows and duties."
I expect you to show as much patience as I am now.
I -- I mean it's all right. It doesn't matter.  I'm -- my name is Andrews, Charlie Andrews. I've come from India -- I've read a great deal about you.
I am. But I'm not so egotistical as to think He plans His day around my dilemmas.
Did they take your clothes?
I think you do.  But I thank God we all don't.
It does. We must be getting old, Charlie.
Well, I don't know how you got a ticket for --
I think if we all worked to publicize it... all of the Congress... every avenue we know.
It was one incident.
That the fighting will stop -- that you make me believe it will never start again.
Not if they arrest me -- or a thousand -- or ten thousand.  It is not only generals who know how to plan campaigns.
First spin. Let the others march for a time.
I --
No.
I -- I will write to the press -- here -- and in England.  And I will use the courts.
Yes, sir. The day he sets off everyone is supposed to raise the flag of "Free India." Then he walks some two hundred and forty miles to the sea and makes salt.
Have you found him?
God, even <i>you</i> want to tell me what I <i>can't</i> do. In case you hadn't noticed, Anton, I don't need rescuing.  But <i>you</i> did, once.
Of course, Sir.  We're checking the entry log, alibis, grudges...
I'll run a crossover on the eyelash for any family or associate connections--
What a pity.
This is a murder investigation.  The public should be happy to co-operate, to get this disease off the streets.
No.  But one or two "borrowed ladders" have shown up there in the past.
This unaccountable specimen was found in the south wing corridor.
One look through there and you would know why I can't possibly allow you to disrupt operations any further.
Again?
Six one.
He's too tall.
Suit yourself.
Listen, I don't want you to think I'm ungrateful --I know you and that little broker--what do you call him?
God, you're serious, aren't you?
You wish.
They found him in his office this morning-- beaten so bad they had to check his nametag.
What <i>is</i> that one?
We can't stay here.
They think I offed the Director.
I'm not going anywhere.  Less than a week to go. Not on your life--
Where is your head, Jerome?  You're acting like a guilty man.  They won't marry the eyelash to you.  They won't believe that one of their elite navigators could have suckered them for the last five years.
She's already got her doubts.  I have to act like nothing's wrong.
Don't worry about your little pin cushion. To be honest, I'm looking forward to having the place to myself.
That's the hair color in his profile?
We were just looking.
In the South Wing.
Why would I be angry?  It was beautiful.
I don't think so.  The only trip I'll make in space is around the sun--  --on this satellite right here.
Who are they?
We'll get it later.  Irene, please.
You remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron? It's the exact height of the front fender.  Looked right instead of left.
You hypocrite.  Do you think for one moment you'd be doing what you're doing if it wasn't for who you are--<i>what</i> you are?  Don't you get <i>any</i> satisfaction knowing that your children will be able to live to a ripe old age unless they do something foolish?
I forgot something--something at home. I'll see you later.
--Unfortunately my son's not all that they promised.  But then, who know what he could do.
What about her?  Let's c ut up the money, I want to get North.
You know, you and I may be two of a kind.
So we did that crackerbox... to cover for you.
What do you want for dinner?
I'm still here, Doc.
It's all right.
It's just been a while.
Sure.
You got the parole, didn't you?
Nail him first, be careful he doesn't panic and want to shoot somebody. Local police have one car, a rover, shouldn't be in the vicinity at the time we hit unless it's answering an emergency call... if the cop car shows up remember it doesn't have any automatic weapons. Only a shotgun braced on the dashboard. Get into a tight spot, you'll be out of range at forty yards. Then they're down to their side guns.
There are three men dead.
Do it my way.
What the hell do you want? Mary Tyler Moore?
Do you mean that?
When they find it, they find it.
Like what?
El Paso.
Either we pick it up or else we leave it right here. We got to go one way or another.
Can we make it?
Hell, I don't know... but we sure gave it a run.
That certainly makes you kind of special...
Yeah. I got out.
Just sandwiches...
Mexico. I'd like to find a quiet place to cross.
What's it to you?
Sure am.
I don't report the car and I don't know either of you?
You can trust him...
How long have you been married?
The three of us are going to do some traveling. We're going to take your car to El Paso.
Who?
Yes, but listen. Christ, I didn't kill him.
Why?
I don't know. That's all I was told.
I'd like a word with you, Jack.
Who sent you, Thorpey?
On the Durham Road. The Pantiles.
Doreen.
No. No. It's not like that. I've got a husband, you know.
I can't.
Nothing more? Just another feller?
No.
Really?
A fairy godmother, all of your own. Aren't you lucky?
Oh, he was. He told me a magic spell that would make you come.
Brumby.
Tell me about the girl.
What girl?
The young girl. Who pulled her?
Shouldn't think so.
No. Frank was a good bloke.
Working at Woolworths.
You coming to South America?
I mean, I was surprised when he didn't turn up for work.  He was always on time.
Why would it?
Las Vegas.
Who's Brumby?
Yeah.
Definitely.
No. Really, I am.
Yes, Edna, and I must say you've been great about the ...
Stick the soft soap. Let's be having it.
Ta-ra.
Don't ask me.
What about Keith?
What about Keith?
What's that gun doing in your room? Suppose I phoned the police and told them there's a bloke staying in my hotel who's planning to shoot somebody?
Yes, thank you.
No. Are you tired?
No chance of that.
What you doing around here then?
Sit down, Jack,  I could weep. I really could. Sometimes I think I'll retire. Just piss off to the Bahamas and let somebody else employ them,  Glenda, get Jack a drink. What is it, Jack?
Of course, of course. Well, any time, just drop by.
No.
Calling my bluff, are you, Harry?
Well, I think I had one once.
Some contest board...
I...
No.
Nurses.
He is?
What?
Huh.
You don't ax your sales force.
No.
That's what I...
Look look look look, when they build your business, then you can't fucking turn around, enslave them, treat them like children, fuck them up the ass, leave them to fend for themselves... no.  No.  You're absolutely right, and I want to tell you something.
What?
Yes...?
What?
Someone should hurt them.
Huh.
We're just "talking" about it.
Yes.
You're actually talking about this?
Is that what I said?
That's right, the guys are moving them downtown.  After the thirtieth. Murray and Mitch.  After the contest.
You're, you're saying so you have to go in there tonight and...
Yes.
Why would I do it?
Me?
Why are you doing this to me, Dave. Why are you talking this way to me? I don't understand.  Why are you doing this at all...?
What is the five grand?  What is the, you said that we were going to split five...
What do you care...?
I am?
You hit a bad streak.  We've all... look at this: fifteen units Mountain View, the fucking things get stole.
What?
Why?  Because they're stupid. "Where were you last night..."
Did they catch...?
In school.
That they're going to be upset.
Which, wait a second, which is not until the check is cashed.
Levene!!
You have a problem?
...no...
The premium leads.  Yes.  I know what they cost.  John.  Because I, I generated the dollar revenue sufficient to buy them.  Nineteen senny-nine, you know what I made? Senny-nine?  Ninety-six thousand dollars.  John?  For Murray... For Mitch...look at the sheets...
...apart from the top men on the contest board.
And fifty bucks a lead.
I can't do it, Shelly...
The deal still stands, our other thing.
What?
Well, hadn't it?
If you tell me where the leads are, I won't turn you in.  If you don't, I am going to tell the cop you stole them, Mitch and Murray will see that you go to jail.  Believe me they will.  Now, what did you do with the leads?  I'm walking in that door--you have five seconds to tell me: or you are going to jail.
Five thousand.  I kept half.
I...
Abso...
Na, fuck the leads, I'm going home.
Hey, big fucking deal.  Broke a bad streak...
Guess who?
"You have to believe in yourself... you"--look--"alright...?"
Bruce..."I don't want to fuck around with you.  I don't want to go round this, and pussyfoot around the thing, you have to look back on this.  I do, too.  I came here to do good for you and me.  For both of us.  Why take an interim position? 
Yes.  I did.  This morning.  What I'm saying to you: things can change.  You see?  This is where you fuck up, because this is something you don't know.  You can't look down the road.  And see what's coming.  Might be someone else, John.  It might be someone new, eh?  Someone new.  And you can't look back. 'Cause you don't know history.  You ask them.  When we were at Rio Rancho, who was top man?  A month...?  Two months...? Eight months in twelve for three years in a row.  You know what that means?  You know what that means? Is that luck?  Is that some, some, some purloined leads?  That's skill. That's talent, that's, that's...
What is it?
Home cooking...
Kenilworth...?
Kenilworth.
Yes.
Gimlet.
Well, let's have a couple more.  My name is Richard Roma, what's yours?
I don't understand.
But I'm not counting it.  Wednesday.  Thursday.  Friday.  So it would have elapsed.
I don't know.
What was the earliest it could have been cashed?
I told you.
What...?  Say the words.
I don't have the power.  I said it.
She told me I had to get back the check or call the State's att...
Not to my knowledge, no...
You going to turn State's?
Fuck you, Ricky.  I ain't going out today.  I'm going home.  I'm going home because nothing's accomplished here...Anyone talks to this guy is...
Harriet and blah blah Nyborg.
Why not?
I'm going home.
Your farewell to the troops?
'Cause I don't have to eat this month.  No.  Okay.  Give 'em to me...  Fucking Mitch and Murray going to shit a br...what am I going to do all...
If you don't want it, give it back.
Yes.
No, where is it?
I can't.
I can help you.
I was taller than you when I was fourteen.
Well, that's alright... alright. Good.  You'll graduate in another year, isn't that right?  You know... I never finished college.  I was a good student, but I never finished. Of course, there was a war then.
 What?  You read it in the papers?
She couldn't decide.
What can we do?
How are the kids?
I got surprises for everybody!
We're going to Europe next week.  I want to get passage booked on the Queen.
Michael...
Tom is right.
Kids, why don't you go outside for a while?
Yeah, but I don't want him to see you.
He's the head of the family.
Deanna, I'm going to belt you right in the mouth!
I'm getting out of here I said; these guys all have guns!
 You must understand, this is all new to me...
Yeah, some deal I made.
I didn't turn against nobody; he turned against me.
Let's go.
We're making an investment in Havana.
I never looked down on you, Fredo. You don't look down at a brother.
Sincere.  What are you talking about, of course I'm sincere with you, Mike.
Tonight we've been invited to a reception at the Presidential Palace; to bring in the New Year. You and I will go in a special car that's being sent.  They'll have cocktails... then dinner, and a reception with the President.  When it's over, it will be suggested that you take Questadt and his friends from Washington to spend the night with some women.  I'll go home alone in the car; and before I reach the hotel, I'll be assassinated.
What is it?  Can I help?
I was kept pretty much in the dark. I didn't know all that much.
He's an Italian?
Because he's what we say... &quot;connected&quot;... You wait, see what happens to those guys from Ninth Avenue.
He took the money.  Now he wants double from everybody in the neighborhood, including Papa.
When is it finally over?  I want it to be over before my baby is born.
If I'm wrong...
I took care of it.
My information is that Fredo thought it was a kidnapping.  Roth assured him nothing would happen to you.
I don't know.
Mike, it would be like trying to kill the President; there's no way we can get to him.
How do I know you haven't gone into business for yourself?
Yeah, but don't worry.
Tom, what do I do now?
You know there's a Senate Investigating Committee recently set up; we thought it would be unfortunate if they were to trace anything though-provoking to your name.
Maybe two, three thousand dollars.
The witness is excused; take him out.
Mr. Hagen's, ma'am.
I wanted to see you before you went back to Nevada.  Also, the children - Michael, they're here.
I'm not going to stay long; I can't.
I like sporting events -- I really enjoy watching them in the afternoon. One of the things I love about this country.  I loved baseball ever since Arnold Rothstein fixed the World Series of 1919...I heard you had some trouble.
The Rosato Brothers have performed services for you in the past; I understand that they are under your protection.
My concern is that the three million never arrived at Batista's numbered account in Switzerland. He thinks it's because you have second thoughts about his ability to stop the rebels.
There was this kid that I grew up with; he was a couple years younger than me, and sort of looked up to me, you know.  We did our first work together, worked our way out of the street.  Things were good and we made the most of it.  During prohibition, we ran molasses up to Canada and made a fortune; your father too.  I guess as much as anyone, I loved him and trusted him. Later on he had an idea to make a city out of a desert stop-over for G.I.'s on the way to the West Coast. That kid's name was Moe Greene, and the city he invented was Las Vegas. This was a great man; a man with vision and guts; and there isn't even a plaque or a signpost or a statue of him in that town.  Someone put a bullet through his eye; no one knows who gave the order.  When I heard about it I wasn't angry.  I knew Moe; I knew he was headstrong, and talking loud, and saying stupid things.  So when he turned up dead, I let it go, and said to myself: this is the business we've chosen. I never asked, who gave the go ahead because it had nothing to do with business.
He's very kind, tell him it's appreciated.  I'm sure it will be profitable all the way around.
This witness has testified that you are personally responsible for the murder of a New York Police Captain in the year 1947 and with him a man named Virgil Sollozzo.  Do you deny this?
When do we talk?
You give your loyalty to a Jew over your own blood.
I didn't want you to know I was coming.  You heard what happened in my home?
I was just going to contact you, Michael; we just had a 'sit-down' - in fact, I just come from there.
Mike, I don't understand.  Don't ask me to do that.
This was my father's old study. When I was a kid, we had to be quiet when we played near here. When I was older, I learned many things from him here.  I was happy that this house never went to strangers; first Clemenza took it over, and then you.  My father taught me, in this room, never to act until you know everything that's behind things.  Never.  If Hyman Roth sees that I interceded with you in the Rosato Brothers' favor, he'll think his relationship with me is still sound.  I'm going somewhere to meet him tomorrow.  We have friends in some very important business that we're making.  Do this for me; you make the peace with the Rosato Brothers on their terms.  Let the word out that I forced you; you're not happy wit hit, but acquiesced, just because of me.  It will get back to Hyman Roth.  Do this, Frankie.  You can trust me.
You wasn't listening, you didn't want to talk.
Then Carmine Fucillo and Tony Blue DeRosa will need to be fitted for slabs.
You know if there's a way I'll go to the commission and the commission will side with me.  That puts me and the other New York families against you.
How much more a month?
Eh...  Five dollars more.
What was that?
I won't keep you another minute...
Why is everybody giving me crap tonight?
All right, then.  He's interested in you for your conversation.  We know what a great talker you are.
Not anymore you don't.  Doll.
Go wash glasses if you don't like it.
Funny is funny and scary is scary. You don't mix them.
I've gotten to know someone who's famous.
It means it's too cold to go swimming.  And I don't mean the water.
Yeah, and I'm never going to smoke another cigarette.
You do that.
Why?
Oh, I don't know.  Because no girl in her right mind will have me?
You did not know?
No!
My name is Whale.  This is my house.
Boone.  Clayton Boone.
I couldn't help but notice your tattoo.  That phrase?  Death Before Dishonor.  What does it mean?
Just got away from me.  Sorry to disturb you.
Splendid.
I'm just a hick who cuts lawns. But some of these look familiar.
But before I retired, you might say I had a brief time in the sun. Fame, as it were.  Tell me, do you like motion pictures?
Merely comfortable.  Here's Hanna with our refreshments.  Can you get the door?
What was wrong?
To an artistic eye, you understand. Have you ever modeled?
Football in college.
Yes.  You were a Marine.
You don't say?  Which picture?
"Bride of Frankenstein."
I assume you worked up an appetite with your labor.
It's nothing to be ashamed of, in the service of one's country. That's something to be proud of.
I'm not, you know.
Very well put.
Better work.
Cut it out!
I was an officer.
We're not sugar.  We won't melt.
I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.  I believe I promised you some clothes.
"A perfect night for mystery and horror.  The air itself is filled with monsters."
But that was so long ago.  It can't still bother you.
What won't do?
It's from the first World War, isn't it?
Oh, but you have.  You undressed for me.  I kissed you.  I even touched your prick.  How will you be able to live with yourself?
Nothing I didn't deserve.
Need some help?
Have a drink?
She took the night off.  Heavy date.  Some guy she's had her eye on for a while.
You only embarrass yourself.
Oh dear.  I'll never work in this town again?
But I have no reputation.  I'm as free as the air.
No.  I never could.  You must regret having had the invitation sent.
That's what I'm trying to explain.
Oh, nothing out of the ordinary. Growing old.
Go.
Good night.
Is it now?  Hanna?  I think we'll take our tea down by the swimming pool.
Let's make it more interesting.  I will answer any question you ask. But, for each answer, you must remove one article of clothing.
I can't believe I'm doing this.
Righto.  Let me see.
Who came up with the Monster's makeup and look?
My idea.  Muchly.  My sketches. Big heavy brow.  Head flat on top so they could take out the old brain and put in the new, like tinned beef.
I'm the one who got you on Mr. Cukor's guest list.
You, Mr. Kay?  How do you know George Cukor?
Ma'am, the pleasure is all mine.  James Whale.
About your brother. And the deeeep shit he's in --
A boost? What's Kip doing on a boost?
Don't feel the need to explore my family dynamics, Atley...
I do a poaching number. Six-ounce fillets in a saucepan of brine. In 8 minutes, I could cater a goddamn wedding. Plain but flavorful. And it's a good way to show off my Hollandaise sauce ...
No, but you dress like an asshole ...
I knew you'd say that, too --
Everyone know Ray Calitri? Pillar of the community ...
Let them go. And I'll leave ...
Yes, Kip. Short for Kipling. Named for the English writer of stories about India ... He bites into his pear ... Memphis says nothing, waits ...
I don't know. But you shouldn't be here. Take care of your business. I'll give you 24 hours. And then I don't want to see your face. Ever again. Make a fool of me once, that's my bad. Make a fool of me twice. That's really my bad, and I'll kick your ass from here to India ...
Something like that -
Sure. But sometimes we got to create some numbers. The task force is run by statistics, you know ...
Just out there. Roaming around. Building up my collection of refrigerator magnets ...
Keys were in it ...
You got a school teacher or Nancy from accounting, you don't put on Sly Stone or James Brown. You put on Ravel. Rachmaninoff. But if you got some wild one you just picked up at the track, you wouldn't put on Cat Stevens or James Taylor. You'd put on Prince. Or Isaac Hayes. Or, if you really wanted to get after it: Miles.
Yeah.
No. The needy. Us. Cos we need this car!
Donny-nothin'!
Freb can order pizzas like nobody's business
That's right. Only 10 exotics ...
He didn't mess up. There it is ...
We don't -- ?
How's Kip?
Atley Jackson came to see me ...
Mother -- !
You remember that, Kip?
I got a message. I live at 1443 Locklin.
You've been pre-booked...
I dunno. It was right here. Someone musta' boosted it back...
You all right -- ?
I can handle it --
You can handle it?
I can handle it --
You?
Thank-you ...
It's for assholes. The Legal Buck blows, Memphis.  You know that. Doing this, we make mad bank, my boys are down, the girlies come around and the boosts are a breeze. Yeah, sure, you're gonna get jacked-up every now and then - but ain't that a small price to pay for never, never-ever, having to say "paper or plastic?"
That's strange. I'm nervous. Donny's nervous. Everyone's nervous. But not you...
I dunno. Whatever will be will be...
Things are all leafy and suburban ...
DO IT! NOW -- !
On account of me.
Oh, yeah.
You're going high-cheese, dude --
They're factory alarms ... Easy to get around... For a man with... Skills...
Hear you roar ...
Kip's not clear yet. We got one more to go --
I dunno. I know a place.
You remember Junie?
What happened? Old-age happened. I tired of killing them. I woke up one morning and thought I am no longer a destroyer. I am a means of resurrection. Now. We restore. We revive. There are so few things in this life, we can prevent from decay. Most must die. These don't have to...
It can be done. Take two days to shop; one to prep. I'll offer up my bible for a small fee. You also have to hope Kip's jerk-circus didn't undo Castlebeck's linkage so much so that he's setting up surveillance teams on every city block. And then get yourself a crew...
The hard part ...
Yeah, I'm cool ...
Who's "Eleanor?"
She soars -
Because you should be home with Nintendo, listening to The Spice Girls, little man ...
What? What happened?
But he was always a bad kid, that one.
Son of a bitch. Get over here.
Oh I Him.
And, if you hear about anybody else fucking around with that shit, you tell me.
I understand.
You think I didn't know what you were doing?
I thought you were going to stand me up. You looked bored. You didn't say anything. What did you expect. Tommy was all over me. Right?
He watches it for me. It's better than waiting at a garage.
You want her to visit you?  Good! Let her stay up all night crying and writing letters to the parole board.
You know. The stuff I left.
Yeah. What about the kids' school?
Jimmy. He'll be okay. He's good for it. Relax.
Fuck Paulie. If Batts' crew finds we whacked him, we got real problems.
I think you got a good shot at beating the case.
Jesus! You must think I'm dumb. What are you bugging me for? I know what to do!
I don't care. I need my hat.  I won't go without it.
He's insulting me. Rat bastard. He's never been any fuckin' good.
Keep him here. I'm going for a bag.
I hate to do dishes.
He says he's too hot.  He doesn't even know I came here today.  It's like he's crazy. Jimmy.
Ma!  Please! You're driving me crazy.
Ma!  Stop! What do you want me to do?
We'll pick it up.
They won't be left back. They'll stay in their grade.
But, Paulie, please.
What can I do? If I could do something, don't you think I would?
Yeah.
What? Come on!
I don't know, we'll fuck up some smart kids.  You'd prob'ly fit right in.
She went to Medical school in California.
Sorry, brother.  I don't know what to tell ya. You know all the girls I been with. You been with 'em too, except for Cheryl McGovern which was a big mistake on your part brother...
Some shows are worth the price of admission, partner.
Yah, but it's better than this shit. At least you'd make some nice bank.
Listen, you got somethin' that none of us have.
Let me tell you what I do know. Every day I come by to pick you up, and we go out drinkin' or whatever and we have a few laughs. But you know what the best part of my day is? The ten seconds before I knock on the door 'cause I let myself think I might get there, and you'd be gone. I'd knock on the door and you wouldn't be there. You just left.
NO SHE DIDN'T GET YOUR DOUBLE BURGER!! IT'S ALL FUCKIN' FLYIN' FISH FILET!!
I told you "no" yesterday!
You're walkin' bitch, Will's takin' the car.
Why don't you beat off at your house?
You thought we forgot, didn't you? I know I'm gettin' my licks in.
Fuck you, I did the body work. Whose fuckin' router you think sanded out all that bondo?
History? Just "history?" It must have been a survey course then.
Hey, I'm the last guy to want to talk about school at the bar. But as long as you're here I want to "seize" the opportunity to ask you a question.
Elementary? Oh, I don't doubt that it was. I remember the class, it was just between recess and lunch.
That's one aspect of what we do.
Why shouldn't I work for the National Security Agency? That's a tough one.
Down there.  And I'm nervous.
--But what he's doing, he's attaching an edge to the adjacent vertex. He can always failsafe to either side--
Yeah, can I help you?
Fuck do you want?
It's an integer proof.
I don't know what it's called.
It's right.  Take it home with you.
Hey, how you doin'?
So who won the bet?
I need someone with your kind of background.
Can we do it at my office?
Tom.
Sean, I really don't think you understand--
I know what I'm doing and I know why I'm here!
--And why does he hang out with his friends? Because any one of those kids would come in here and take a bat to your head if he asked them to. It's called loyalty!
You're wrong, Sean. I'm where I am today because I was pushed. And because I learned to push myself!
He's not you!
About thirty million to one.
No, but, I mean you know...I do other things. That no one knows about.
C'mon, I read your book. I talked to you. It's just something I know to be true.
I'm sure you do. You probably got a real nice house, nice car -- your book's a best seller.
Probably not.
Whatever blows your hair back.
Free weights. WILL Oh yeah? Me too. What do you bench?
Poor color composition, lousy use of space. But that shit doesn't really concern me.
I know, but the joke's better if I tell it in the first person.
I know what I'm doing. She's different from the other girls I met. We have a really good time. She's smart, beautiful, fun...
Why? Because of the pain I feel now? I have regrets Will, but I don't regret a singel day I spent with her.
You should have seen this girl. She lit up the room.
You're kiddin' me.
Well hell, I didn't know Pudge was gonna hit the home run.
What did you think?
Do you have a soul-mate?
Yeah.
I didn't ask for this.
No.  Have you had any experience with that?
I know.
It's not your fault.
Yeah, I think so.
Okay, you got me. It's the ugly, obnoxious, toothless loser who got drunk and wouldn't leave you alone all night.
Oh Will! I was wondering when you'd call.
I bet your parents were happy to pay.
Yes you have. You were thinking you were gonna get a good night kiss.
How many?
Do you keep in touch with them?
You should have called. I have an "O- chem" lab due tomorrow and it's impossible.  It's not an excuse dummy. I want to go out with you. But look:
If you bring the caramels.
All right, all right. We'll go.
Rich? I have an inheritance. It's two handred and fifty thousand dollars. That's exactly what it'll cost me, minus about five hundred bucks, to go all the way through med school. This is what I'm doing with that money. I could have done anything I wanted. I could have expanded my wardrobe, substantially.
I guess. I don't know. How do you remember your phone number?
Like me?
I want you to come with me.
You know what I want to hear? I want to hear that you don't love me. If you tell me that, then I'll leave you alone. I won't ask any questions and I won't be in your life.
Be glad to get my han' on some cotton. That's the kin' a pickin' I understan'.
Lissen. I don't care nothin' about you, but if you mess in this, your whole fambly li'ble to get in trouble, an' Tom get sent back to the penitentiary.
No. Ain't ever gonna be scared no more.  I was, though. For a while I thought we was beat--*good* an' beat. Looked like we didn't have nothin' in the worl' but enemies--wasn't *no*body frien'ly anymore. It made me feel bad an' scared too--like we was lost... an' nobody cared.
Hey, wait a minute. You got change comin'.
Kids?
Can all of you work?
Okay. House 63. Wages 5 cents a box. No bruised fruit. Move along and go to work right away.
Two an' a half! Say, mister, a man can't make his dinner on that.
But--but how we gonna eat?
We'll work it out. What's this committee you talkin' about?
We got five sanitary units. Each one elects a central committee man. They make the laws, an' what they say goes.
Government.
*You* find out, I can't.
Can't promise you that, but there'll be a licensed agent here tomorrow mornin', if you want to talk to him.
Ma's shore gonna like it here. She ain't been treated decent for a long time.
Have a little snort?
I'll be glad to see you pa. Last time I seen him was at a baptizin', an' he had one a the bigges' doses of the Holy Sperit I ever seen. He go to jumpin' over bushes, howlin' like a dog-wolf in moon-time. Fin'ly he picks hisself out a bush big as a piana an' he let out a squawk an' took a run at that bush. Well, sir, he cleared her but he bust his leg snap in two. They was a travellin' dentist there and he set her, an' I give her a prayin' over, but they wasn't no more Holy Sperit in your pa after that.
Well--tell the folks inside how it is, Tom. Tell 'em they're starvin' us and stabbin' theirself in the back. An' as sure as God made little apples it's goin' back to two an' a half jus' as soon as they clear us out.
Try an' tell 'em, Tom. They'll get two an' a half, jus' the minute we're gone. An' you know what that is? That's one ton a peaches picked an' carried for a dollar. That way you can't even buy food enough to keep you alive! Tell 'em to come out with us, Tom! Them peaches is *ripe*. Two days out an' they'll pay *all* of us five!
We was outa food. Tonight we had meat. Not much, but we had it. Think Pa's gonna give up his meat on account a other fellas? An' Rosasharn needs milk. Think Ma's gonna starve that baby jus' cause a bunch a fellas is yellin' outside a gate?
Women is always tar'd.
I don't stick my nose in nobody's business.
Yeah.
You been acrost?
It don't take no nerve to do somep'n when there ain't nothin' else you can do. 
Five they're a-gettin' now, an' that's all they're int'rested in. I know exackly what Pa'd say. He'd jus' say it wasn't none a his business.
No plants.
Okay. Go ahead, but you better keep movin'.
I'll walk back.
Maybe that's jus' what he done.
I like the tent better.
I never *seen* her so sassy.  An' she ain't so young, neither!
They charge extry at the comp'ny store but they ain't no other place.
We *got* to, Tommy. But that's gonna be awright. I seen the han'bills, about how much work they is, an' high wages, too. But I gotta fin' out somepin' else first, Tommy.  Did they hurt you, son? Did they hurt you an' make you mean-mad?
No, Ma I was at first--but not no more.
Granma's dead.
They know he got hit in the face.
I'm gonna go away tonight. I can't go puttin' this on you folks.
Don't know--but it's better'n this.
Awright, Tommy. What you figger you gonna do?
He was a good man.
Tommy, they'll drive you, an' cut you down like they done to Casy.
I know, ma'am... on'y it's for a ole lady, no teeth, gotta sof'n it with water so she can chew it, an' she's hongry.
They gone.
They come. They come and pushed me off.
I can't help that. All I know is I got my orders. They told me to tell you you got to get off, and that's what I'm telling you.
California, here we come!
Me an' you both.
I ain't gonna fret you. Go on!
Won't they ketch us?
Lissen. You done busted it. You hear?  But lissen here. I won't tell nobody, y'understan'?
Morning.
It seemed like my life was slipping away, somehow. I was a knot in the middle of a wet rope. Everything was futile and nothing had value.
To make a long story short...
It's nice to see you again.
More like what happened? What happened, Mr. Blank?
It's a swift spiritual kick to the head that alters your reality forever.
That'd be good.
Seven it is.
I'll just help myself to a cocktail.
Right.
What?
--She's not dead---
Seriously, when I left, I joined the Army and took the service exam. They found my psych results fit a certain profile. A certain "Moral flexibility" would be the best way to describe it... I was loaned out to a CIA- sponsored program. It's called "mechanical operations." We sort of found each other...
I was leaving.
Will you come with me?
What if I come back?
Other people can't.
Saw my mom... I'm with Debi, and I'm on my way to the reunion.
I don't think so.
If he does our job, he's our job.
I get it.
Don't tease me. You know what I do for a living.
Mmm, not really. But you're gonna love this one.
That's wonderful, Mom.
Marlin Perkins and Jim!
You don't have a headache. I have a headache.
You're leaving me hanging here...
No. You drove us here.
No.
I was catching up with Bob Destephano.
How did you get this job?
Good evening, Mr. Blank.
I visualized you, in a haze, as one of the slackster, flannel-wearing, coffeehouse-misanthropes I've been seeing in Newsweek.
I took the other road. I'm more of a self-reflective young lion who does business with lead-pipe cruelty and goes home to drink light beer in milky-eyes isolation. I love sports and sex and have no real relationships with anyone. And you?
Oh, you know me, Martin. I'm the same old sell-out baby-boomer, exploiting the oppressed I got shot for at Kent State. But why don't we have a drink and forget the whole thing?
That's good.
Ma'am, first class to Montana is a waste of good money. Now, am I being too polite here or when I say NO in Utah, does that mean YES in New York City?
Branding?  I haven't branded in years.
Does Chicago count?
I don't sleep all right anywhere. But the house is fine.
Thanks.
We did at one point. When we thought we'd have more children. And we after tried. We tried everything, but... wasn't meant to be.
Ha, ha... all right, well, uh I guess you can bring out the pasta.
Ssshhh...  Stand still, Annie. Takes what we've got, just for now. Can you do that?
I don't want to lie down. I've been lying down enough.
I brought it to you in the hospital.
-- enough time tomorrow. I know.
Look, if you want to take it in the morning, that's fine.
What would they say? "Ten miles to big rock." "Twenty miles to bigger rock."
Hi.
Yeah. Does that mean I'm cured?!
Yeah, you know everything!!
What?... Oh baby...
Who's there?
Nothing new. He's just going off duty.
Yeah.
About us going someplace warm... Someplace Grace'll have to wear shorts or bathing suits or summer dresses...
I come home and you tell me we're going to drive a psychotic horse to Montana! I can't just pick up and leave...
Her psychiatrist... said... she needs security now... stability...
Well then... maybe I will take some time... come visit.
I apologize for the surprise, but the days only opened yesterday and I figured...
You don't have to explain. You have every right to come.
Connecticut. I told the office I'd work out of there next week. When are you planning to start back?
I don't understa-
And I have two choices. I can either fight the way things are, or accept them.  See, I always knew I loved you more. Didn't bother me. I always felt lucky... a little amazed... that such a vibrant, beautiful woman would want to be with a man like me... And I guess I thought as long as I did everything right -- if I was the best husband I could be, the best father... even being a good lawyer only mattered to me because of what it meant for us... if I could do all that, it wouldn't make any difference if we loved each other the same or not... I wasn't asking for more. I told myself I didn't need more.  But you don't know how you feel about me. You don't know... if you want a life with me anymore...  And I don't want you to come home until you do know...  ... one way or the other.
Either fight the way things are or accept it.
Well... I know I should reject that offer, but I'm not going to.
You and Frank ever take a vacation?
Frank's a good man.
Well, of course, right...
... I just don't know right now! Do whatever you can and when Grace is --
Probably best. You may want to shoot yourself half way to Ohio.
There's a kid at school says we should've imprint-trained him.
Be honest, I can't say I did it all myself. My grandma helped me get the words right.
Uh, I'm Tom Booker. Your mother around?
I don't know if I can with my leg.
Not a question of if you can -- you are. Just keep your eyes on the road and your foot on the pedal and the rest will take care of yourself.
I just could never say it!
Kind of trouble I'm in the mood for.
You ever miss it?
Good. Good man. Alright, let's finish up here, and take him in for interrogation.
The Red Book. NSA Trusted Networks. Otherwise known as the Ugly Red Book that won't fit on a shelf.
Yeah but oh man,  wouldn't you just love to get one of those Gibsons, baby? Ooooh!
Was that her top?
Check this out. It's a memo about how they're gonna deal with those oil spills that happened on the fourteenth.
Again?  Yeah sure.
Super hero like even.
Stupid, man. It's universally stupid.
Right. If I win, you wear a dress on our date.
I'm taking over a TV network.
Finish up, honey, and get to sleep. And happy birthday.
Well, yeah, I just haven't found one as charming as you yet.
Revenge.
What can I tell you. Computers never lie, kid. Your mom will be arrested at work, she'll be handcuffed, and later, strip searched.
Kid, don't threaten me. There are worse things than death and, uh, I can do all of them!
Never heard of you. Done anything?
I got photographic memory.  It's a curse!  Lisa!
And judging by this segment alone, it's already eaten about...
My... class. You mean I'm not in your class?
I'm Crash Override.
It's cool, I'm just looking.
Yeah. It's not just the chip, it has a PCI bus. But you knew that.
Your slave?
Do my ears deceive me?
Right. And when the worm's ready, it zips out with the money and erases its tracks.
You what?
They didn't. The guys felt it was the only way I'd get a date. Anyway, you're pretty good. You're elite.
Uhhmmm... uh gee, uh...
212-555-4240.
Sorry, I can't help you, okay?
No. He's either very smart or very stupid.
Cancer, brain... Brain Cancer?
What? whatwhatwhat?
Precisely what you're paid to prevent.
Congratulations.
Hello, operator? I'm having trouble dialing a number.
Yeah.  Should be on the road.
When did you find this out?
Well you found out this morning? Why didn't you tell me before? I mean it's 5 o'clock now Rachel...shit
Don't get angry.
I'm not angry it's just
No, you don't understand.
I am different, it's just that I just got pissed off...that's all.
I don't know!
Go!
An accident?
You'll have to watch Jamie tonight.
Can't you find somebody else?
I know, and next to that is the police, hospital, fire, and probably National Guard.
How do you know their not?
I'm not calling the fire department.
About what?
I've said this before. I think your the one who needs medical help.
Drive Carefully.
Looks to me like your out of business. Now I want some answers.
Okay, out.
But I thought you didn't want to go trick-or-treating.
It was the nightmare man
Come on.
Wise up to what men want Rachel, or Brady won't be the last man you lose to another woman.
You won't look pushy.
Fact it Rach, you are desperate.  Your just going to go in and buy a costume for Jamie. Perfectly legit.
Jamie?
Hey. I got a town full of beer bellies running around in the dark with shotguns. Who's gonna be next? Somebody's wife? Somebody's kid?
Dear God.
They didn't know what they were fighting.
Be here in a minute.
They've survived this ordeal, they'll survive it's memory.
Your hunting it, ain't ya? Yeah, your hunting it all right, just like me.
What are you hunting, Mr. Sayer?
Okay.
We did. Fifteen minutes. You totally never showed up.
All right. The Wallaces leave at seven.
I don't know yet. I have to get out of taking my stupid brother trick-or- treating.
Fun-ny. See you.
Exploring uncharted territory?
Behind that bush there.
I thought it was an obscene phone call.
I've already lost it.
What's this big, big news?
And I can't keep you interested?
Yeah.
Promise?
I keep thinking I should call the radio and TV stations...
Nothing's going on. Just kids playing pranks, trick or treating, partying, getting high... I have the feeling you're way off on this...
I think you have too much to do tomorrow.
It's your own fault and I don't feel sorry for you.
Will you read to me? Can we make popcorn?
Sure. Sure.
What about the bogyman?
Was it the bogyman?
No! Do as I say.
You're coming with us...
She's washing her clothes.
PROBABLY going.
You don't have anything to worry about. He hasn't spoken a word in 15 years.
Uh --
It's really terrible.
Yeah.
Look, it's just an evening at the opera.  Did I, I-I do wrong in accepting?
Really?  Is the food that bad?
Now I'm going to tell you the truth. I really came in here because I was bored stiff by the party.
What makes you think we're more interesting?
Right.  Yeah, but Fifth is so jammed, isn't it?
Yes.
You mentioned on the phone that you'd had some dizziness.
When did you first notice this?
Yeah.  Some of them...yeah, some of them are very big.
Okay.  Why, all of a sudden, is the sketch dirty? 
We nev-- We don't name names!  We say the Pope.
Oh, what, in this section of town?
Yes? LEE  A couple of blocks from here.  If you don't know about it, you should. You'd really love it.
Yes?
Uh, yes!
Yes?
Oh, oh, yes.  I-I-I-'d like to, uh, uh, very much.
Thanks for showing me the bookstore. Perhaps you could, uh, take me to an AA meeting sometime.  Uh...uh, I'd love to see what goes on.
Oh, speaking of records...I bought that Mozart Trio you recommended...
I...I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm sorry.  I have to talk to you for... There's so much that I want to tell you.
Well, how do you expect me to react to such a thing?
It's been nearly a year since our first time and you're still married to my sister, which...I now realize is fine because you're probably much more in love with her than you know.
Let's go have dinner, shall we?
Holly and April, thanks for helping.
Yes, you were.  A-and when I, when I brought up the idea of having a baby, you just, you jumped down my throat.
I didn't say that.
Are you?
Yeah.
It's on the table, Dad.
Oh, honey!
Because I got off to a wrong foot with my own thing, you know.  B-b- b-but I need a dramatic change in my life. FATHER  You're gonna believe in Jesus Christ?
Oh! 'Cause you won't exist!
Based on what?  You never even see him.
Oh, no, no, no.  He's my sister's husband.  And I think if you gave him half a chance, you'd like him. He's very intelligent.
Oh, Frederick!
I'm not interested in what your interior decorator would think, okay?!
Because I have to!
No.
You are, you are my only connection to the world!
Oh, God, I don't even know what I want.
It was on your shirt!
Oh, yeah?  How's she doing?
Why?
Really?
Oh, now-- 
I'm-I'm okay.  Yeah, I-I-I, you know, I...I'm just, um, I got dizzy all of a sudden.  I'm-I'm...I have a headache.
I think we need to eat.
Huh?
...a little, uh, hey!  A little hug! What is this?  Now how 'bout a little action from the kids?
I like him.  I think he's a sweet guy.
Go right over there.
Go out, go out by the Sung vase and, and catch this.
Right.  We felt that if we were gonna do it, that we would like somebody who we knew and who we liked and who was warm and bright and...
The sacrifices I've made because of that man.  He's ruined me with his ego, his philandering, his--  his-his-his-his mediocrity!
I know.  H-how much do you need?
Yeah.
Oh, perfect!  He reminds me of Ichabod Crane.  His Adam's apple keeps jumping up and down whenever he gets excited. HANNAH  Listen.  He's a lot better than your ex-husband.  He's got a good job.  Would you light those, please? He's-he's-he's not a dope addict or anything.
No, I'm sorry.  No, I didn't mean that.  No, I didn't mean that.
So what's new?
Yeah, you mean not at my age.
Uh, losers!  All losers!
Oh, well, I cannot communicate with you!  I, you know, I never realized you were such a tightass. MICKEY I can't understand you.  Your sisters, both sisters have such good taste in music.  I don't know where you went, went wrong.
Do you mind?  I'm-I'm my own person.
Right.  Yeah.  I had a...
I recall you.
...in a really horrible way.
Oh, well, that was a long time ago.
You didn't answer my question. What are you doing?
Well...
No, you can tell me.
Well, I'd love it if you'd read it, actually, 'cause I really would value your opinion.
...Hannah read it, she got really angry, and... you know, then I felt badly, so I--
I should have kept going.  I-I have a sneaking feeling, a nagging sensation I should've kept walking and...
Really?
Yeah.
Hi.
I need an antihistamine.  Mom thinks she's feeling her asthma, and so...
Oh...
Yeah, okay, right.  Forget it.  What's to eat?
Take our literature...
We have to talk about <u>money</u>...
You've gone off to America, on your <u>Vacation</u>...
Yes?  My <u>promotion</u>...?
I hereby acknowledge that...
I'm looking for...
Lechter's not buying up his Memorabilia. He keeps it all in his "mind," do you see...?
There's one or two freaks, and, for a "<u>Pass</u>," I'll rat them out to you... 
Well, if he hasn't, I'm vastly mistaken.
...these guy'll back you up.
I almost shot the <u>baby</u>...
Bad coffee, and women with excessive ankles.
Atrocious Torture.  Hit of the Season, you want, I know a guy can get you a ticket.
Our operatives in Brazil have been empowered to offer a reward of....
Seen what, sir..?
Somewhere in Italy.
Waal, Nobody's <u>Perfect</u>... What do we hear from our songbird in Switzerland?
Have the child taken to bed.
I won't take much of his time.
I... think... he was.... he was <u>touched</u>, by your reaction.  To his appearance.
He is...?
...Mr. Verger would be pleased to make a contribution, to the charitable...
Tell him to give it to an orphanage.
Mmm...
...and then, he'll be coming down.
You said the <u>bad</u> news...
Yes, I did.
And I expect you to.  Let's talk like two medical men 
Let the girl go.
One moment, and they're at the <u>Seven-</u> <u>Eleven</u>.  They botched the fallback plan, they...
One moment, I'm not done with you...  Give him the file...
Well, then, you have insufficient information.  I'm grateful for this opportunity to set you straight.
Well, then, you're a lucky girl, cause that baby's gone to be your family.  ...I've got an appointment....
What'd you say, hon...?
Hey, you know, I never thought of that...
And how do we account for the interest of such a charming man, an interest in Torture?
And yet, they are not know for their cuisine.
You looked oddly at me, back on the landing.
Enchante.
We got KittyKat...
Sir, I was, as instructed, waiting for the Arrival of the Strike Force. {PAUSE)
Let's get her <u>out</u> of here....
Spoken like a Protestant.
Thanks to <u>you</u>...
And how did he do that?
Explain in depth the plan we have for him.  Until tomorrow.
I want the <u>same</u> drink.  Cause it did me <u>good</u>... but I already drunk it, so, barring that, yes, I would like another.
Show'm the FBI <u>Hand</u>shake...
No.  I want to buy a dog. 
...what?
N'not <u>that</u> sad.
...get me a cigarette.
I want the money.
The shape of a Three.
...what a lovely perfume.
Waal, you c'n only get it in one shop in Alexandria Virginia, n'that's where I'm going, cause I'm goin <u>home</u>, f'i can get n'y'one, Of That Nature, to <u>take</u> her there...
I din't solve it, I didn't '<u>solve it</u>'.  I just sat a <u>dance</u> out with him.  Facts, facts, facts.  <u>Facts</u>, close the case, cavalier.
...I feel that...
I don't <u>think</u> so.
...no...
I saw a man today, a man so hideously deformed who'll spend his life in a hospital bbb...
What's wrong with approval?  You admired that man.
Yes.
That if <u>decision</u> were a useful tool, you wouldn't <u>be</u> here.  Why are you here...?
Your life has been defined by institutions.  The Orphanage where you were raised, the FBI Academy, the Bureau.  If the Institution is your life, <u>accept</u> it.  Ask to be reinstated on the "Drumgo" task force.  Play their game.
I've come to see you, sir, about an Auction...
About three days. I'm a monster. He's a monster. Actually, we're both just guys. I don't expect you to understand that I...
Why are you being so grouchy--This is an important night for us...
Andrew. You're not gay; you're ten. You shouldn't even be having thoughts like...
Man, it's not like I don't know about women. I had this babysitter...
Eric...You can't be like me. You have to be better. I'm not the guy you think I am...
Sorry about all that...I'm your CIT-- Jasper.
I don't know about you dickweeds, but I gotta go take a nice, long juicy dump.
So what?                                                    ]
How do you mean?                                            ]
I-unno...Don't worry, I had everything on the hand memorized.
You know, this reminds me of the time we were talking about something and then just started kissing...
That's bullshit. Just shoot.
You did last night.
I'll think about it.
Don't think.
Ouch....the lunchtime poll. So what's the question?
Don't worry. David says he's very so he's very.
Heather, I feel awful, like I'm going to throw up. Can we jam, please?
You goddamn bitch!
I made your favorite. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.
Color me nauseous.
King David.
That's the punchline. She's still alive, in stable condition. Another case of a geek trying to imitate the popular people of the school and failing miserably. Is that pate?
Oh shit, yeah.
People love you but I know you. Jennifer Forbes told me the petition she signed was to put a jacuzzi in the cafeteria. And Doug Hylton...
You're not funny.
Like a suicide thing?
She missed "myriad" on a vocab test two weeks ago, all right?
French.
Uh well hey, let's take a look at the homosexual artifacts I dug up. Now, prepare to be a little disappointed.
Oh come <u>on</u>. Lots of people drink Perrier. It's come a long way.
This is Ohio. If you don't have a brewsky in your hand after dark you might as well be wearing a dress.
Yeah, but don't worry, it was worth it just to see the look on....
You kids are making too much damn noise.
Phase my ass! You'll be <u>back</u>! I'm storming Normandy beaches and you're running in place with Pauline Fonda's airhead peacenik exercise program. Have to stay tough! You'll be back.
You want to wipe the slate clean as much as I do. Okay, so maybe I am killing everyone in the school because nobody loves me. You have a purpose though! Remember? Let's face it, the only place different social types can genuinely get along with each other is in heaven.
Let's kick his ass.
Goddamn Geek!
May<u>be</u>.
I'm not sure . . . but it's proving to be very popular!
We're pretty handy with model making, too, eh?
Are you a carpenter, Mr. Rieper? HERBERT shakes his head.
I work at Dennis Brothers Fish Supply.
Actually, Mr. Rieper . . . it's a novel, and we'll be sending it to New York. That's where all the big publishing houses are based.
pops a couple more potatoes on Pauline's plate. HERBERT glances at Pauline.
I'm not hungry.
Do you think Juliet could stay here while her parents are away?
It's a letter from the school . . . from Miss Stewart.
You're failing English . . . you used to be top of the class- PAULINE I'm doing my own writing!
These stories are not going to get you School Certificate! You don't seriously think anyone's going to publish them?
is very angry.
I don't wanna be in bloody school!
You have to let me go!
looks down at the ground in front of her.
They sent me off to the Bahamas "for the good of my health." They sent me to the Bay of bloody Islands "for the good of my health."
Hello, Juliet. Juliet take off her jacket.
Of course it matters! It's Mario!
You're such an incredible woman.
That's great! We'll have the fare in no time!
You came in for your EEG. You fell asleep and well, I took the liberty of...I'm sorry. You looked like a wreck Trevor.
Your insight is enlightening.
Okay Mr. Statistics I've got one for you. What's the most common cause of death for adults over the age of eighteen?
Oh I knew about the chairs already. This is where the emphysema patients come to sneak cigarettes.
I understand... I won't-
Why didn't you tell me sooner? I would have switched doctors!
Just get better okay?
Really? Do tell.
As much as he feels like. Its a much more pleasurable line of work.
Shut up and play darling. Your turn.
Five hundred ninety two thousand seven hundred and four.
You know what the family lawyer told me one our wedding day?
There is no wisdom, no insight, no plan 
Really, why's that?
Thanks.
Hey ninety five point three percent of all murders are committed by either a spouse, a direct relative or a close friend that's common knowledge. But this wasn't murder it was an accident-
Ambulance.
I hear everything. And soon you will know everything. More than you ever wanted I can guarantee that. But I want you to think for a minute first. Think about all you've seen. All the clues you've been given.
What things do you think you've done?
YOU!
I never really thought they'd go for it.  And then... you didn't come forward, they investigated my war record...  I kept expecting you to show up and expose me...
I don't need to be a hero, LaPlante, but I can't face people... the looks in their eyes... after the trust they gave me!
I'm not saying I hate sick people or anything but I hate being <u>around</u> them if you know what I mean.  There <u>you</u> go, you <u>inspire</u> this kid to <u>live</u>.  I probably woulda vomited on him.
And give a deposition to the jUdge.
He gives a good report and I walk?
Yeah, I been calling in sick.  They think I got the flu.
And a son by your ex-wife?  Joseph.
Are you pretty involved in his upbringing?
I read the probation report.  It's not good.  I think you're going... going to prison, Mister... Bernie. I know that scares you but..
You mean John Bubber?
Mister LaPlante...
Mister LaPlante...
Mister LaPlante...
My attorney, she's just outta law school, about a couple of years older than my kid, for Chrissake.
Nine.  I think.  Maybe ten.  Yeah, ten.  Nice kid.
The thing about kids is, they're so... young!  They don't know nothin' yet.  When you're a kid, you think you're gonna grow up an' be a "wonderful person" instead of an asshole, like everybody else.
You mean like Bubber?  The hero?
Yeah, like that.  Same thing.
The cops!  What kinda bullshit is this?  Is this America or -- ?
He had one <u>tiny</u>, uncharacteristic moment of weakness.  That's not the same thing as a lifetime of petty crime...
-- saved your...  whaaaaaaat?  What? Blackmailing...?
Well, maybe I wouldn't lie...but I could tell the story the way I did just now, so that people could understand that John is even more of a hero, and that you... you're the lowest thing that ever crawled.  Your name will be synonymous with cynical opportunism and blackmail.  You won't get a cent.
You media people, you think you can just go anywhere you want, spy on people.
Mister LaPlante... Bernie... I... just for a few moments... I want to be a human being, not a reporter. I'm somebody who was going to die in a burning plane and I looked up, and some man came out of the smoke, his face smeared with mud, and soot and... and he... saved my... life. Off the record.  Was it you?  Why would you deny it if it was? Because you took my purse?  Why?
Were you in it?  In the war?
Me in my uniform.  Used to be on the bookcase.
Yeah.  I'll see ya... dad.
John, I'm sure she could support just about anything.  I think I'll see you to your room. A sort of bodyguard.  Make sure no harm comes to you.
A script!  I thought we just walked through everything...
Yeah, I got it.  Sports training. You learn to follow the ball.  How about you do a wrap-up from up here?  I'll pan off that skyscraper over there, find you here, then reveal the drop.
Maybe, maybe not.  I have a feeling this guy is important somehow.
"For Excellence in the Pursuit of Truth."
Because he was a <u>real</u> hero, Chucky. He was acting out of a deep instinctive decency, not out of some ego thing.  He didn't expect the media to lionize him.  He didn't expect a million dollar reward. He saved fifty-four people because something inside him, some fundamental love for his fellow man, made him rush into that plane when "good sense" told him otherwise. He was willing to settle for some credit cards he sold to LaPlante....  For how much, LaPlante?  A couple of bucks?  Did you give him enough for a decent meal?
You're sitting on your ticket.
Apparently the guy who pulled you out wasn't a passenger...
A Silver Mike!  You're covering us in glory!
Drake Hotel, Penthouse Suite.  Never stop worrying.  I figure we'll do a sidebar on what it's like to go from sleeping in your car and collecting cans to sleeping in the poshest suite in town.  Also Gale's onto something, digging into his background.
Said he's not an actor.
Who lost a shoe?  Wash your hands.
Wh-why's he... why's he up there, mom?
Never reach out!
Reporters don't have hormones?
They're great with kids.  They love 'em.  They eat 'em up.  I'm kidding.
I'm Bernard, by the way.  Those are cool Reeboks, Neil.  They're real new, aren't they?
Nah, that's some guy fixing the living room floor.
Any particular brand?
Wife, girlfriend or mother?
Oh, good -- well, I hope you'll have more to tell me next time.
I am.  I'm really feeling pretty good.  I have a much stronger sense of how far I've come.
Because life isn't about playing it safe.  Life is about taking risks.
An occupational hazard, I'm afraid.
What happened?
Uh huh.
I think we should talk first.
"Find a penny, pick it up, all day long you'll have good luck!"
Bye, Neil!
I'm thirsty.
Uh huh.
Yes, he did, and I don't like it any more than you do.
Because you'd have to get up at five a.m., would you like that?
I think we got it just in time before the ink dried.
I know it's at the high end of our range --
He's made some friends, hasn't he?
Honey, I'm sorry, I think the vacation will be a good break for both of us.  You'll see.
Did you lock the garage door?
I think you should feel like dancing at a time like this.
C'mon.
<u>Everything</u> -- that I've been talking to other people behind his back -- that's what he called me -- a back-stabber and a deceiver. To him and to the company. He called me a traitor in front of everybody and told me if I wanted to be a VP over at Lowenthal I might as well pack up and go -- only <u>Lowenthal never</u> <u>showed up for our lunch</u>!  It's like everybody got an anonymous poison-pen letter or some --  Do you smell smoke?
No, Philip, I don't want you coming back here.  And if you want to talk to me -- <u>call</u>.
Put it out, man!
Do you have enough money?
The thermometer's broken.
Neil, goddamn it, you're not five years old!
Thank you -- how efficient of you.
A tape from the surveillance camera at the First National Bank.  It was robbed this morning.
Really?  I want to make sure that I understand what you're telling me, Greley.  A crime was committed in New York City?  That is news.
He had to come from somewhere.
It's circumstantial.
That's what I figured.  Well, I have a little home coming present for you.
No.  I don't scare easy.
It is a beautiful day.  I am merely enjoying it.
Can't you enjoy it quietly?
Leaving what?
Maybe myself.
Then it's worth the journey.
Living.  Remember?
No -- I will.
Would'st you harm one who comes to aid you?
And what would'st I gain from this bargain?
Why is it you never talk to me about Scotland -- your life there.
I was wondering if I could talk to you?
Are you the type of person who takes advice, Miss Hillman?
It's mine.  It's been in my family for years.  It belonged to my great, great, great grandmother.
New York is dangerous place.
You talk to me -- but you don't answer my questions.  I guess I'll have to talk to Lieutenant Bedsoe.
Meet me Tratino's at nine.
Why?
You don't really believe this do you?
So?
It will end tonight.
I do not know -- and even if I did...
I know.
No -- I'm fine.  Thank you.
Me too.
I love you, Conner.
Is it a mistake for someone to go to the ones who love them when they're in trouble?
I haven't lived life -- I've hidden from it.  I've existed in the shadows.
Would you like to deposit this in your account?
Yes, sir.
Don't tell anyone what you're doing, not Louise, not the other guys, not the Sheriffs.  You understand me, Larry?
Chief...it's like none of this exists. I'm sorry.
I took the call from Glen personally. They're still in Smith's house.
It's happening right now.
Are you totally stupid?  What does it look like?
Jesus, first Mars, now you.  You two need anti-depressants.
That's crazy, Dennis.  The cops will see us.
Fuck it's over.  That money's mine.
I'm not going to die for this!
The Bristo Police Department.  Look out the window.  You see the car?
I'm here.
I want a helicopter to take us to Mexico.
That's not going to happen, Dennis.  They won't give you a helicopter.
Let me come get him.
There's a million dollars in there, maybe <u>two</u> million.  I'll give you half.
Give up, Dennis.  Let these people go. At least you'll have your life.
Hey, I've got a situation here, in case you haven't noticed.
Use more ice.
Aw, Jesus, not more of this.
<u>Look</u> at him!  I think he's dying!
Who gives a shit, Mars?  Check out the cash!  We're rich.
You can't run with suitcases.
I got the gasoline --
Keeps to himself, more like.
Pretty sure I do.  Yeah, here we go --
It won't be a problem.
You fucked up, Glen.
Fuck that!  You think I'm crazy?!
You'd better be kidding.
The Sheriffs will take over when they get here.
We can use the crawlspace to get downstairs.  Then we can run for it.
No!  I'm not going to leave Daddy with them!
How about dog shit?
If my father dies they'll charge you with his murder.  Can't you make Dennis see that?
He said something about a girl --
Keep your head down.
He.  Can't.  Answer.
Chief Talley is the one who got you out.
Go, Chief.
Go, Chief.
I know the one.
Laura Martin.  This is Will Maddox, the primary negotiator --
If you go in, you can't use tear gas or flashbangs.  The whole place would go up.
Then I think we should wait.  Do you agree?
I'm not stupid!  You can't get out of here fast enough, then you take back command; you agree to wait on Smith, then you risk everything in a stupid stunt to get him out --
Go, Mickey.
What?
I asked you my name.  You just saw my commission slip.  What's my fucking name?
I think so.
I think he was working on them today, so they're probably in his office.  Could you find them and see who they belong to?
Dennis won't let me go to the desk.  He makes me sit on the floor.
I thought they locked you in your room.
I can get into the crawlspace from my closet and climb all over the house.
I opened Marlon.  I think it's somebody's taxes.
No!  They're right here --
Yes.
These disks . . . where are they?
What do you mean by that?
Yes, Benedict, what can I do?
Excuse me?
The Hutu-Tutsi thing. The BBC faxed to say they would be here on the sixth for the peace accords. And the U.N. wants the banquet room for that day, a reception to broadcast the signing ceremony. Can you organize monitors and check the satellite dish?
Leave it to me.
Ten thousand francs for each one.
You want to buy anymore cockroaches ask for Captain Naramunju.
No. But I fear it's intention may have been to kill the peace accords and spark a civil war between the Hutu Militia and the Tutsi rebels.
Their people?
Yes. Where are the Rwandan police?
Will you protect us.
The rebels have fought their way into the city. They have many Hutu prisoners.
Oh, Paul, talk to the coat check, please.
The United Nations are still here.
Yes, they can photograph the epaulets on your shoulder.
Indeed, general. Excuse me momentarily.
I understand General, but when I last talked to the president of Sabena he promised me that anyone who helped protect Belgian property would be rewarded.
Please, I have money. They're driving into an ambush, it's on the radio.
No. We have no way of finding other stock but I have money for you from the guests.
No, sir.
Wonderful country, wonderful golf. I wonder - will I ever go back? What do you think?
I hope we all get to do many things. Can we go now?
How so.
Youâ€™re drunk.
I am in charge now. Get back to work or I'll fire you.
I saw the sign.
I know that, Paul. I'm sorry.
Take it for Christ sake. I wish it was a fucking aeroplane.
I will remember that name.  Let's go.
They have him in the lobby, go quickly.
How do you know?
Also, this is your bill for the last week.
Let's have dinner first.
Murdered! By whom?
Please. Let them stay 'til morning. The militia will not come here, they know you are a Hutu with influence.
But who is left?
Do as I say. I will be there soon.
A car.
Paul Rusesabagina, Mr. Godefroid. The house manager. I met you on your last visit.
Many beers.
I do not know, sir. I think they will kill us all.
Can I help you?
Oh, he's got no problem with that: I'm his fourth.
You're the Doctor, sweetheart. 'Guess the atropine worked, then.
-- the James Dean wannabe with the hair trigger --
-- there's already been way too many complications for a very simple plan. You ever find out what happened to Melissa Marr?
It was on my Dad's list of "things to do." But the House did him first.
-- uh, excuse me, just one quick question? How long before this damn thing unseals itself?
C'mon.
Running all the bells and whistles we set up to scare hell out of everybody --
-- well, let's hear it for small miracles --
-- but I imagine we'll all be mutilated beyond recognition by then.
Nothing.
The...Fourth of July.
And we get this money when?
No -- keep pulling, it's moving!
Yeah. And under other abnormal circumstances, I think this would be the time to seriously jump your bones.
Haven't they already?
Oh, I think we're going to have several.
Shredded. Sorry. Decided to whip up one of my own: a group so hungry for money that they'd be willing to do anything. I thought you'd be more comfortable with your peers.
You tell me. I don't know how you managed to hack into my Mac, but: bravo.
All accidents until proven otherwise.
I know.
Really? Well, let it rip.
-- the sadistic prick --
I mean, did she stage it all for you and then go hide -- or did you just flat out kill the little bitch --
-- oh, for chrissake, that's a given; we all know that knocking me off is the bottom line here --
Question answered.
Well, who's the damn thing <u>from</u>?
What?
Like what?? This isn't supposed to be happening!!
Alright, Mr. Pritchett, let me just sign the damn thing.
What?
I think, Pritchett, we've got a situation here that even you can't explain away as "ghosts." This is ice- cold homicide by person -- or persons --
You're forgetting my lovely wife; she's part of the same winner-take-all as the rest of you.
Not just yet. Would any of you be interested in knowing exactly why I ended up here in the basement?
I was chasing after somebody I saw in the salon.
Then just wait -- maybe this whoever's got you next on the Asylum's equipment- test list. Maybe a literal mind-blow inside the "Saturation Chamber."
I'll take my chances.
Please! I need your help.
"Dummy 6" keeps losing his arm.
Maybe it was just its time to finally fall apart.
It better be -- he still owes me $25 grand for renting the place for the night! Here, let's get you some illumination so you can make your way safely!
What's going on?
Pritchett, this "lockdown" thing -- it's gotta have like a master control -- you know machinery, gears, whatever -- somewhere in this place?
Blackburn's dead.
Melissa, it's Sara -- is that you?
It might have been her mother.
Why don't you pass me your plate?
Sure.
I didn't do anything, mommy.
We'll get it later.
Take me to her.
That's father, Aubrey. SEAMUS Well yes I did.  Lived here my whole life.
It's dark!  I can't breathe!
Daddy help!
Aubrey run! Aubrey stares in horror at Maura - just then the knife FADES AWAY as Maura rolls over, returned to normal -
Oh come on...
You didn't think much about that before.
Well what power lines, Will?  Where?  Maybe we should call someone about it.
Oh come on!
Voodoo stick?  It's nothing like that Will.  You're just being cynical.
I'm sure this sounds crazy to you.
Should I...
Nothing's changed, has it. You still want to deceive me?
We're not going.
I'm all right...
What do you mean, unfortunately?
What about the other five percent?
She's at school.  We've tried not to upset her more than she's been.
May I come in?
Come back to us honey, don't be afraid!
Well, I believe her mind was playing tricks on her, God rest her soul.  She would hear things, see things...
I didn't do anything...God saved her...
I wish I had an answer.  Evil is powerful, more so every day it seems.  But I believe the worst for you and for this house is behind us.
Yes, they are.
I mean hardly any thigh.  I'm telling you, Joey; shorter skirt, more lift on the leg-cross ... and you're made.
You'd lose the money-shots.  No.  I'll catch a bus.  Or a cab.  Don't worry about it.  Go.
The cusp of my life.  What I was, what I am, what I will be ... past, present, future, all bound here at this timeless moment of decision.  I was an explorer of forbidden vices and pleasures. Opening the Box was my final act of exploration, of discovery.
What will he do?  What does he want?
Right.
Oh, go on.  Have one.  Fuck it.  You think you're going to live forever?
Yes I do.  Terri, something awful happened to that boy.  I have to find out what it was.
Wait a minute.  He was already ... wounded ... when you found him?
I'll do it!
The bank owns it.  But I'm working on it.
Guys.  Sometimes friends.  Mostly guys.
Who's that?
No.  He knows it won't.  It was his final act of love and part of him knows that and part of him doesn't yet.
Buying some drugs, alright?
Sure.  Just papers, photos.  Stuff nobody'd ever want.
Right at the back there.  Middle shelves.  Coupla folders.  Nice stuff. I'd do you a good price.
You're apologizing?
I know.  I know.  It's bad.  I'm a bad person.  But I try not to be, Terri.  I really do.  And I really miss you.
Oh, I don't ...
Sure.  Sure.  I understand.  It's cool. I mean, we've got all night.
Hey, you didn't fuck it up with me.  You know that.  It was my fault, babe, it really was.  And you know I'm sorry. And I'm sorry to see you upset now.  I hate to see you in pain like this.
Oh, not much.  Mario Brothers want me to do a job.
You're not...LISTENING!
Hey, you promised......Don't worry, I'm wearing my girdle.
"Every day you meet quite a few."
You're a reed, man.  I gotta get Anna.  Hang in there...
You're supposed to be dead!
Yeah.  The big E.
He came into a world where crime is a legitimate business tactic and a legitimate government procedure.  But he knew Right and Wrong.  Oh, and we kind of messed around...
A little petting is not the issue!
God go with you, sister.
Fantastic.  Perfection.  The Vatican extends its jealousy to the lucky bidder.
No, I meant you didn't have to tackle me and rip my dress.  A polite push, perhaps?  A clear shout of "watch out, Anna" would have done nicely...
That's what you theenk.
Secret passageways don't mean as much as they used to.  There's a place two blocks east of here. Enzo's.  Say 10:30.
I was the Warden?
How long were you in?
You really went and did it.  With one day, not even a day, of planning, you did it.  Nobody does it better, Hudson.  You started the week stealing the Sforza and you ended it swiping the Codex.
Selfish attitude?  I'm just some guy who wants a little nap and a cappuccino for when he wakes up, not too much foam...
Fits my new image.  A thief for the masses.  This is one job I'm not going to feel guilty about enjoying.  Gum.
And then we'll arrest those greedy pigs... Is that it?
Ah, the mafia, the cops; do I know how to party or what?
I don't care.
Surely a master-thief like you can tell the difference.
Because I didn't want to get hurt, taterhead.
Hey, guys, I've always wanted to sing like Franki Valli and the other seasons, but come on....
You certainly do.
Jail, you asshole!  Our foot soldiers will blow your brains out!  Bunny, Ball-Ball!
Bastard!  If you were a true American.
Bastard, you're going to need another nose!
To what do I owe the dishonor of a reunion, you centrally intelligent scumsicle.
I'm supposed to fall for that?
Yeah, right.  By the way, as long as I'm getting things off my chest, I'm the one who killed your little monkey.  Made it look like a Mafia hit.  Did it for fun. Ciao.
The Shazzammeter!
Of course -- I went to the Muncie, uh, Secretarial Polytechnic!
Exactly. And I bet she's ugly. Real ugly. Otherwise, why wouldn't they print her picture next to her byline?
I understand that you're not very skilled yet in the secretarial arts. I'm not that skilled as president. Oh sure, I put up a big front --  -- not that everyone's buying it.
Uh -- Yes. Seventeen. Yes, I -- well no, I -- I never really... There's a place I go now, the cutest little place near my apartment in Greenwich Village. It's called Ann's 440. It's a beatnik bar.
You're awful kind to yourself, Norville Barnes -- the fact is you've slowed down, sitting up here like a sultan, not doing a lick of work! Why you know it's ideas that are the lifeblood of industry and you haven't come up with one since the hoop and the reason's plain to see! You've forgotten what made your ideas exciting for you in the first place -- it wasn't for the fame and the wealth and the mindless adulation of -- would you get out of here?!
Worked in a watch factory?
Oh Norville, I --
Hey! Where's that martini?!
Just give me another chance, Norville -- I can help you fight this thing. I know this last story was a lie! We can prove it! We can --
I filed it yesterday.
I don't know...
I've got an even hotter story -- The Sap from the City Desk.
Amy -- take a break. You've worked hard on this story -- heck, you broke it for us! But it's passed you by and Smith here has taken up the slack.
So ya see, I won't be in the mailroom long.
Absolutely, Buzz, I'm glad he --
Yessir.
Well, why don't ya read it.
I need that voucher! I told you a week ago it was important!
Disappointment? J'etais destroyee! I was in bed for a week! Positively sick with fury! I called in the gardener and said, 'Monsieur Gonzalez, either those azaleas come up next spring or you are terminee!
Mm. Ordinarily I wouldn't bother you with it, but -- this is embarrassing, kid -- it seems to concern you directly.
How's that, Sid?
It's not important in itself -- some elevator boy you fired came to me claiming you'd stolen the idea for the, uh, the hoop dingus from him --
...Her mother needs an operation...
He don't look wise.
That's nonsense, Alma.
You don't believe in it?
I asked you to let me explain. It's a long story.  And not an easy one --
Is she a doctor?
I like her already.
I went to school in Buffalo.  Paul went to school in England.
Of course.  It's been nice of you to spend this much time with me.
Why?  Everybody else knows it. Paul saw to that.  Sometimes I think he planned the whole thing from the beginning -- just to watch me squirm.
Please, Wes, do as I ask.  You must rest, you must sleep.
If I were as timid as you seem to think, Mr. Holland, I wouldn't have gone into the tower in the first place.
And what is so alarming about the tower, Miss Connell?
I took Mrs. Holland to the Houmfort.  I thought they might cure her.
What I saw the other night, I didn't dare believe, Betsy --
Yes, I said it, and I made myself believe it. But when I got here, Jessica was already raging with fever.
I believe there's a kinder name for it, Wesley. At St. Thomas, it's called the Institute for Mental Therapy.
It doesn't matter what you call it. I can tell you right now Jessica isn't going!
Foolish?  Tell them how foolish it is, Paul -- tell them!
Dr. Maxwell has very unpleasant news for us.
Gotcha George, not a problem. Tomorrow. Hey, you want to start covering the old filmed entertainment sector yourself?
Ben you know that's your territory - and I wouldn't dream to trespass - you're the expert. Hey, how do you think Paramount's gonna do with that Blatty novel, what's it called? The Exorcist?
Brilliant. Hey, you heading out a little early today?
Got a meeting uptown.
Don't see how. I think the public's had its fill of this gangster stuff. No, trust me -- disaster pics. And air hockey.
In Rhode Island with the folks. I'm a free agent tonight.
It's you Ben who needs to talk. I've had my say, and I'm waiting to hear back from you.
-- And you haven't moved out yet. It's because you're too lazy, Ben. Too scared or lazy to either deal with us or simply make a decision --
What do you think?
So early?
Um, yes.
You know Elena, I've been thinking--
Leave it -- I'll wash it for you.
I get you loud and clear... hey, you look nice.
See for yourself.
Elena, what are you're talking about?
Classes?
Anyone special? You know...
Hnnn.
You're boring me. I have a husband. I don't particularly feel the need for another.
What are you talking about?
How you take it isn't all that interesting to me, Benjamin. I'm sorry --
Nah.
Oh for crying out loud Ben, you don't mean to tell me that your marriage is going down the drain now --
But what?
Jesus, Benjamin, you're still as gullible as ever.
I thought I'd start trying. If you don't mind. But I am going to Florida and I do have a new nurse.
Sure is good shit. It's opiated. I had it in my chamber for a while. I was smoking this other --
It's what?
Don't fret, Benjie, it's --
My husband is probably passed out in the bathroom, or at least he wishes he were. I've been married to him for 17 years and I don't have any intention of going in there to get him... so what I'm proposing is that since your wife has gone off with a boy, and since you are standing here alone, I'm proposing that you and I do what makes sense. Stay warm. Pass some time. That's all.
Jim, maybe we should just go. I've got to look in on the kids. Paul is supposed to be coming back in from the city.
Of course.
Oh Wendy.
I'm that predictable? No, you don't have to answer that. It's just that with the kids almost grown --
Reverend Edwards. Philip Edwards. You came by and checked out the congregation a couple of times last year.
Well I of course flatter myself that our church is not exactly what most people would call organized religion -- at times it's the disorganization that's liberating -- and of course I've begun to minister much more in what one might call therapeutic environments, in small groups, and one on one, couples --
Francis. You gonna leave the seeds in there? In the binding like that?
Let's see!
My what?
It's like very positive, and I feel a real special feeling, because you really --
And I have a special feeling too, because I do. It's special.
Good thinking Marge.
I don't have a girlfriend.
It's freezing.
I don't know.
Wendy!
And?
Shit. I can't really talk about it. I guess I better get to the train.
The ones you built?
What are you doing?
Just thought I'd stop by.
Communist Viet Cong.
You never tasted the stuff?
One more shot?
Huh?
The bartender at Darrow's.  He was there Friday night.
Call all of them from here to Anchorage. Tell them we now know that Kay Connell left the party with a dark blue knapsack, but we haven't recovered it yet.  We can get it in by the morning editions.
How much closer would you say you were?
I don't remember.
Don't worry.  I'll have a cool scar.
That's why I'm here.  I need to know exactly what you saw yesterday, Farrell.
We'll get the other one, though.
What?
That's right.
That's right.
She'd come to me, sometimes in the middle of the night.  Bruises all over her back, her upper arms.  I pled with her to let me call the police, but she wouldn't hear it.  Wanted to keep it a secret.
That's right.
Cut some kind of a deal.  I heard that's what Flynn's doing...
What did he look like?
We're under investigation now.  Back in Seattle.  Hap wanted to talk.  As soon as we got back.  Thought he could work out some kind of deal.
Huh?
Thought you might find that.
Yes down at the station.
Expensive dresses.  A heart necklace.
Who made us what we are?
Surely you know the one who made you...
You mean we are not children of Satan?
I have not spoken to him...
He knew nothing. He just didn't care.
She is.
Like moths around the candle of the age. Decadent, useless. They can't reflect anything. But you do. You reflect its broken heart.
No.
Be glad I made you what you are! You'd be dead not if I hadn't.
You are neither, Claudia. Now stop this --
Yes. Should I take her, Louis? Among her dolls? make a doll of her in turn?
No. She's frightened. She doesn't know where she is.
Do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word? When he put me in that trance...
So you felt it too!
And if I don't?
Fascination...
I'm not interested in you. You disgust me. I'm interested in my own nature and know I can't trust you to tell me the truth about me.
What do you imagine you are Louis?
I don't pretend to know.
Don't you understand, Louis, that you alone of all creatures can see death with impunity... you alone under the rising moon can strike like the hand of God.
Vampires are killers. Predators, who's all seeing eyes were meant to give them detachment.
NO!!!
No...
Is God merciless? Greedy and cruel?
I didn't want to kill her.
That's enough, cherie. Stop before the heart stops.
That's what I do. I interview people. I collect lives. F.M. radio. F.F.R.C. I just interviewed a genuine hero, a cop who -
You followed me here, didn't you?
I'm a vampire.
We can't begin this way. Let me turn on the light.
It's over, I'm telling you...
No.
Storm is what makes it interesting. Thass why all the fish are up. Less hook us a couple big ones.
Yeah, right -- whatever.
Would you relax? We've been dating three months. He ain't stalking your butt.
Yes.
The dockhand guy. Hanging by his neck from up there.
Just kidding.
Can't what?
It's okay.
Tyrell, you are an unstoppable force of nature.
I thought I was over the dreams for good. I really did. I hadn't had one for months.
It's...the anniversary. That's what's going on...Take it easy on yourself.
Right. Now I remember.
I said, this...Do you want a drink?
Right. Planes get hit by lightning. They get hit by meteors. They hit other planes.
No -- it's not that. It's...I'm just a little on edge. I'm really sorry.
Me, me, me. It's always about you. I'm having bad dreams. I can't sleep. I'm not doing well in school. I'm having trouble with my boyfriend.
Just for a minute, baby. I got something I wanna tell you.
Come on, I'll take a break and we'll all dance.
Yeah, a great weekend. Forget the weather!
Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for my friend, my very best friend, Julie James.
Well, I'm in school and --
Well, there's some flaws in her...
The rest of us see bathrobes.
You know, the greenhouse effect has caused the gulf stream to shift and almost every meteorological expert expects a dramatic increase in tropical depression --
Hey -- shut up, okay?
I think she went to bed â€”â I saw her going toward the house
If only we could get away - - you and I. The others are strangers, they mean nothing to me
How kind you are. It is so comforting to know that someone cares.
That should decide it or you --
You were father's secretary -â€ I never thought - -
Mr. Davis seems a good prospect â€”â”young handsome, sympathetic -- ready to listen to you and feel sorry for you - -
You will not say one single word. I know your secret.
You'd do anything to get Oliver away from Thea. But I'm going to stop you. I'm going to tell Mr. Davis exactly what you are.
That's superstition. That's something out of old tales -- about the dead who live â€- I'm talking of something else --cataleptic attacks -- apparent death that is not real.
Theodosia.
What is her illness?
This girl -- Thea â€- is not a servant in my household, sir. She is my daughter's companion. Now, sir, if you'll excuse me, I'll go have a look at Mr. Jacks.
It doesn't seem to bother you much, General.
Plague? There's no possibility of that, is there?
Dr. Drossos will tell us. We will know what to do then.
The General threatened me.
It is for that he hates me.
Merry Christmas.
Well, I guess they do those things. Well, I trust you had a good year.
Yeah, very funny.
It isn't me!
No wonder you jumped in the river.
I jumped in the river to save you so I could get my wings.
There is no George Bailey. You have no papers, no cards, no driver's license, no 4-F card, no insurance policy . . . 
If you know where she is, tell me where my wife is.
That's the kid.
That's the best part of it. They've appointed George here as executive secretary to take his father's place.
You can keep him on. That's all right. As secretary you can hire anyone you like.
Well, this house ain't been lived in for twenty years.
Looks like we'll have to send someone down â€“â a lot of people are asking for help for a man named George Bailey.
Mother? What do you want?
Get over what? I don't take in strangers unless they're sent here by somebody I know.
Well, what happened to you?
Fine.
I see, a flying carpet, huh? I don't suppose you'd like this old second-hand job, would you?
Hmmmm . . .
Oh, stop that grunting.
Oh, it's wonderful.
Hope you enjoy it.
You see what I mean, don't you, Pop?
I know, but . . .
Well, how do you do. Congratulations. Congratulations. What am I doing?
That way, huh?
I just did, but they said you left. This is a pickle, George, this is a pickle.
How does anything like this ever start? All I know is the bank called our loan.
Get a tray for these great big important simoleons.
We'll save them for seed. A toast!
Yeah . . yeah . . . maybe . . . maybe . . .
I'd like to do that.
In the meantime, I'll draw up the papers.
I see. I've suddenly become quite important. What kind of security would I have, George? Have you got any stocks?
Money? Yeah . . . well, a little.
Oh, no. Just right. Your age fits you. Yes, sir, you look a little older without your clothes on.
Ummmmm . . .
Well, not just one wish. A whole hatful, Mary. I know what I'm going to do tomorrow and the next day and the next year and the year after that. I'm shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my feet and I'm going to see the world. Italy, Greece, the Parthenon, the Colosseum. Then I'm coming back here and go to college and see what they know . . . and then I'm going to build things. I'm gonna build air fields. I'm gonna build skyscrapers a hundred stories high. I'm gonna build bridges a mile long . . .
About coming in. Your mother just phoned and said you were on your way over to pay me a visit.
Tuesday.
Where'd you get that dress?
No, I don't want to be rude.
Just a teensie one â€“â ninety-nine, six. She'll be all right.
What plates?
Well, then . . it's usually customary to bring the money with you.
Someone pop your balloon?
I hope that's the cousin.
That's awful.
What the hell.  Did your mom put all this together?
No big thing, we'll see who's out there, maybe picnic.
We'll take your supercargo.
There's a shark....
It's still there!
Abandoned?  It's a little early in the season for that.
Sailing?
Every day?
What else is there to do?
You could work out at the beach, make a few bucks for school.
Oh, c'mon.
Pop.  I'm sorry.
Sure, sure -- Jeff Hendricks brought in this camera, see, from underwater, and I didn't know how to get it open, but my brother-in- law, in Montauk, he works at a hi- fi store, and they sell cameras, so he....
Heck of a way to treat a taxpayer.  Don't you have any pull with the chief, here?
Is that what it is?  Dollars? Money?  I'll pay for it.  Take it out of my salary.
After we've looked, we'll talk.
What shark?
But that's what we're here to find out, right?
Do you?
Because this big fish has been bitten by some other big fish....
Better yet.
Damn.
That's what I said.  Is there any of that hand cleaner stuff?
What'd I say?
Because of today?  The beach?
No sweat.  A blessing in disguise. Back to the city, you can go to Bloomingdale's without waiting six hours for the ferryboat...we're surrounded by water here, you realize that?  Me, surrounded by water...Ridiculous.
Don't rush into it -- we may need the income.
Of course.  Look -- I've got some missing persons, fatalities, evidence of a large predator....
I know, I know....
There's always deaths in these waters that never turn up.  Are they all shark victims?
Perfect.  Look at this ---
What?
Get him the hell over to Amity Point, the old lighthouse.  Right now.
Last transmission said ten juve- niles.
Then nothing.  If you see him, tell him to switch to an operational frequency, or give me a status report yourself.
No.  Find your brother, okay?
What's daddy doing?
I'm not crazy about blind dates.
I will, I will.
Hang on, hang on...Okay, go.
That's a crock of shit.
Wait a minute.  Promise me something.
I'm going.
What the hell, they can't fire both of us -- someone's got to be in charge, right?  Which way are we going?
Anything?
Now you're talking.  Let's get out of here before we do find something.
Is there something I don't know about?
I'll be right there.  Wait up.
It'll be fun, come on!
Good.  I'll be on the dock at eight.  Eight o'clock, everybody!
You always go with Andy.
How was dive class?
Eat Cheerios.
Brody's riding his tower.
What the hell is he doing?
No, I'm fine, thanks.
Okay... Have them get it out of the tank.
Have you checked the bars?  The guy's irresponsible;  he's done this before.
Can't help you, Mike.  Don't have the manpower.
No.
Me?  I don't know.  Twenty, thirty.  I love them, think they're the greatest.
I guess.
I don't like what he does.
I can't leave now.  We taking Sean out?
Oh, yeah.  Very.
You sound like Houston Mission Control.  What the hell does it mean?
I talked you into this?
Are you coming...?
Get your reserve bottle and let's go.
Me, too.
It's my new perfume.  Great White, the Man-Eater.
Yes.  It's faster.
Michael, come on, don't be silly. This is the quickest way.  You're not going to walk all the way around?
Hydrophobia...
Yes, you can.
That's just it, Michael.  We don't!
Only to myself.
Yes, aren't we all.
Well then, can you have them jump to the camera over here?
Wait a minute.  These aren't kangaroos, Mr. Hutton.  They're dolphins.
I can have them walk backwards.
Well, I have to get this into the networks.  If you can't do it, you can't do it, that's all.
Three hundred million years of evolution have created the greatest butcher the world's ever known.
Afraid I can't do that.
Before, you were ready to feed this shark a hand grenade.  Now you're helping to nurse it back to life.
Brian, he's coming around!
Don't blame yourself.
Not good enough.
He's missing.
How long you staying?
As always.
I'm not acting!  I don't want to go in it, okay?
Take it up.
Taking my boyfriend to the airport.
Now what?
Calvin said it was all right.
Yeah, well I didn't!
That's how they do it, you know. Seizes its prey and shakes its body savagely.  Teeth gnaw through a man like a buzz saw.
That's Dad...
It's not that easy.  Worked construction every summer to get through school.  Three years apprentice in the park's engineering department, and two years to build all this.  Finish school first, Sean.  Then make up your mind.  If you still want to work with me, we'll have plenty of time.
No, really.  I've never met anyone like her before.  This is it.
Was Uncle Sean ever bad?  Did you ever spank him?
He was doing his job....
We need milk....
Off....
Do you and Michael ever talk about his work...?  About spending so much time working in the water?
Henny Youngman....
You're not interfering, Ellen....
I'd be afraid of losing....
I don't know what he thinks...I don't know what I think...I don't even know why I'm talking about it...  It's silly...I'm getting too old for this sort of thing....
That....
I'm not doing anything.
I won't....
It's too dangerous....
Where's the lady who brings the soda?
Mommy lets me....
Who's coming?
The water's coming in...The water's coming in....
You were a monkey....
Once he locked himself in the bathroom and your grandfather had to get the ladder and climb in through the window....
I'm worried.. We haven't had our....
Mostly it feels like driving.  You digging for buried treasure?
When it killed Sean it was like a stab in the heart.  I knew with absolute certainty that it had come for him. I knew that.  I know it's coming....
Nothing....
I dreamed about always being warm... Stay a while....
I'm sorry...I....
Yes you can....
Still chasing fish?
Will you leave me alone...?
Yeah, well, just stop yelling.
They put bombs on dolphins....
Holy shit!
Okay.. .we're done, man....
How long?
I don't remember.  One day he was just here....
You think he's not good enough for her?  You're right.  If she was my mother, I'd send her home right now.
I hear he flies a lot of private charters....
I don't like it....
Stop that!
You jump, you'll kill yourself....
I forgot my rubber gloves.  Let's do it.
Jake.
Don't flatter yourself.... 
Only me and Mom ..
We only got one .. He doesn't drive.
Maybe?
How'd you do it, old man?
Someone bet me a dollar ..
Let me just keep going a while. She might remember something?
We're going.
Pay me, and I shut up.
I don't want excuses, I want that weird-looking stuff called "cash."
It's not your friend. It keeps you sucking. Remem- ber the old Bum's lungs?
How come the F.B.I. don't put anya this together? They work- ed over "Jennifer" for months?
I dunno, I daren't go in there - just about get her wired up, and the fucking mayor walks in - mad as hell - what are we doing fuck- ing with his staff? We should be out chasing major violators ..
Car accident.
I'm asking it.
I dunno what I'd do with your help. I've gotta take her out of there ..
Don't thank me. Thank Margie.
That's just what I wanna find out.
It's twenty of three.
What d'you mean, "bits."
Sucked in officers from all over the county. And it was the worst six months this station ever had.
I'm not telling you what to do. What I will say, is <u>right</u> <u>now</u>, that child's tricycle there is more important to me than this ..
It could be anyone's hand. Illeg- ally disposed of hospital debris ..
She's <u>not</u> "missing." Did she shout? Did she scream? Did he coerce her? <u>No</u>. She left of her own free will .. And if she gets on a plane and goes to Peru with the prick, she's still not missing. You got no case, John.
Don't underestimate me .. the Mayor's pissed - but that's nothing to do with this - sit down - How many times have you been up at that institute?
<u>You</u> put it in there.
Well, I think I told you on the phone .. I went up to her room to say good-bye, and we just sat on the bed and chatted a while, while her friend was coming in and out collecting her things ..
Sometimes I look after friends dogs, if they go to dances, or something?
No, just a minute or two .. I knocked on your door - no one home, so I followed the music ..
It was probably the wind.
Oh.
Well, I'm glad we got the conver- sational side of lunch over with.
No, I don't pray .. Had a dream once, about God, just around the time I was getting well .. He was a nasty lookin little guy, moved into the apartment right on topa me .. I said, don't you listen to people's prayers?  He said, prayers? Not often. They're Junk Mail.
Why?
<u>Then explain it to me</u>. I got enough darkness, don't I?
Coz he thinks you're a witness.
He don't know that. I didn't.
I wanna be near you ...
The man from the F.B.I.
Then do me a favor, and keep this outta the newspaper - that dump serves a dozen different communities, we don't even know if it's ours? Till we do I don't want no one worrying about ..
You find something curious in that?
Then let me put your mind at ease .. Firstly, Amber isn't "blind" - she has some useful vision - and second, this isn't a prison, it's a college of higher education - a severe vis- ual disability doesn't mean my stud- ents don't value their independence as much as anybody else - and Amber was a very independent young woman - She decided to leave - so she left ..
What does that mean?
Dinner's another night, darlin .. This is a drive-by. I got an hour ..
Whass going on here?
A derelict.
Whatta you mean, "horrible?"
Oh Gawd, oh yes, it's never been better. Never BETTER!!
One of the accountants.
Well, no you didn't --
It's a plan --  -- _ 51.
What do I do?  How do I spin this?
Could you just stop moving?
Hmm.  Pretty good.
-- the part about "we should embrace what it is still virginal about our enthusiasm" --
My favorite aunt is hearing impaired. He said "you complete me." _ 40.
Absolutely.
Shit, it's just so frustrating to not be able to talk to Avery --
Happy for us.
Call me later, hon.
Happy. He said "happy?"
Look, the other night, I want to apologize.
No no no.  I just underestimated her...  her temper, I guess.  Why are we even talking about this?
Let's not tell our sad stories.
Good night.
Thank you.
Ten seconds, Rod.
It's either going to be Denver or San Diego trading up to take him.
I'm sorry, I --
You feel bad you tested positive? Quit doing blow!  You feel bad about your baby girl? Why did you leave the mother?
Another drink please.
Yeah, man, it means love, respect, community... and the dollars too. The package.  The kwan.
You.
You're hanging by a very thin thread, dude.  And I dig that about you.
No.
What's that supposed to mean?
You don't want to go home, do you?
Look.  I'm happy to entertain you, as always, but I have a question for you.  Are we really "friends?"
Only 'cause my wife likes your wife!
Go.  Flee.
--so our first date, she told me about her favorite place in the world, the seven pools of Hana on the island of Maui...
A year-and-a-half later, we were both in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl. Now I've always hit a wall at 18 months.  Every serious girlfriend lasts 18 months.  It's like --ka- boom.  The curse of 18 months.
How sad --
Jerry.  You two will be together forever.
Damn right, and you can start by taking Rod's poster and putting it where people can see it!
Alright, I'm freaking too.  But they need you to stay calm.  I'll call back. _ 124.
You'll always be my hero, Jerry. Always always always.  We're bringing other elements in, we're focusing on endorsements -- it's not about handholding anymore. We're no longer babysitters --
They do, my brother.
Wait.  I want to tell you more about my dad.
It's in a cage.  Do not be scared of...
Can you be quiet?
Don't worry, honey. We'll circle around and come back.
People change.
Eric...
No, it's...
Think.
I'm trying! That thing took him down this way!
I would completely support that.
Where is it?
I know. I know. I want to look for him too.
Reverse-Darwinism. Survival of the most idiotic.
They never got that big.
Alan, I want to tell you that I'm so sorry about the...
Billy, I can't talk to you now.
A well-accepted theory.
On the island.
Back then, they hadn't tried to eat me.
Why?
Then we go home?
She's the one person I could always count on. And she's saved me more times than she realizes. I owe her everything.
No. I couldn't see.
You know, I've been traveling and I'm very tired. Maybe some other time.
I guarantee it'll be worth your while.
No, no, see Dr. Grant, you're the best. You've seen these animals in the flesh. No one else has come close to you.
Mr. Kirby, trust me, on this island, there is no such thing as safe. We have to get back in this plane...
Dr. Grant, we're not leaving without our son.
It's no use, Dr. Grant. No use.
Ajay.  Go on up to my ranch, take a look around the trophy room, and tell me what kind of quarry you think could possibly be of any interest to me.
Like if you shoot yourself in the foot?  Wouldn't matter.  You'd be dead  before you realized you'd accidentally pulled the trigger.
Because I didn't know!  I don't have the faintest idea what they're doing here.
You'll need an animal behaviorist, someone with unimpeachable credentials.  I believe you already know Sarah Harding.  She's got theories about parenting and nurturing among hunter/scavengers I bet she'd be dying to prove on a scale like this.  If you convince her to go, it'll be a major coup.  When she publishes, the scientific community must take it seriously.
-humidity, I know.  Highest lead density on the market.
Not without a shot of the nest.
That was about a year ago.
No.  Richard talked to his parents.
On the side of that one truck.
Okay.
There are no versions of the truth! This isn't a corporate maneuver, it's my life.
Piss.
DAMN IT, BE SURE!!
He doesn't need a friend, he needs a shrink.
JUMP!
What now?
Wait a minute.  What exactly does this mean?
'Bout thirty seconds.
How am I supposed to transport them?
That's up to your guy on the boat.  Seven o'clock tomorrow night, at the east dock. Make sure he got it right.
I got an eighteen minute window.  Eighteen minutes, and your company catches up on ten years of research.
Six weeks?
The what?
- - and swallows fresh ones.
Ellie, get the gun!  Try to reach the gun!
The other car!
No?  Non-linear equations?  Strange attractions?  Dr. Sattler, I refuse to believe that you are not familiar with the concept of attraction!
Oh, imperfections?
Must go faster, go, go.  Open it up, 5th gear, 5th gear! Here it comes!  Stand on it!  Fifth - stand on it, 5th gear, go!
You're telling me that we're facing a $20 million lawsuit from the family of that injured worker and Hammond couldn't even be bothered to see me?
Why not?
Yeah.
Relax Donald, relax.  They're scientists.  They ought to be curious.
Thank you.
Oh, yeah - - great.
Tim.
Triceratops was a constant browser, and constant browsers would be constantly sick.
Tim, are you okay?
That's a good idea.
It's good protein.  Come on, Lex.  Why don't you touch it?  Look at his nose.
Tim, you're going to have to let go of the fence.  Tim! Get down right now.  Get off the fence!  Now!
Me?  Oh, hell yes.  Three.  I love 'em.  I love kids.  Anything at all can and does happen.
I must've touched something.  This happens all the time. It must be my fault.  Machines hate me.
Yeah, they hate me.
Well, I didn't ask.  Why wouldn't they be?
Kids get scared.
What's to be scared about?  It's just a little hiccup in the power.
For today, I guarantee it.
Alan Grant.  Tell me, what kind of metabolism do they have?  What's their growth rate?  rate of growth.
Do they show intelligence?  With the brain cavity like theirs we assumed - -
I'm trying to use psychology to get you out of the drain, you know!
It's safe.
It's safe.
Go  that's the way we're going to go.  What do you say?
They're just doing what they do.  Well the other kind - -  - - just do what they do.
Bet you'll never look at birds the same way again!
I'll keep an eye on it.  Maybe it'll swing south like the last one.
Ray, start the tour program.
Ken, it's Bruce. Listen, we've got a nibble on the Pendleton financing.
Hey, smart-ass, I'm up here right now in a... luxury alpine retreat, with a two million dollar view of the lake.
Just a deer, Mister Biller. Part of the local wildlife.
Who is this? What's going on?
Yeah. Ken said there was another guy there... _big_ guy... then he dropped the phone. What's going on?
Who's there?
And we're in the center ring.  You sure you want to wear that blazer?
Fuck you.
I thought that was Ted Bundy.
I think it's our best bet. They're taking apart his house right now... they found weapons, blood, a mountain of evidence. We can't say he was framed.
Doesnit sleep?
He wets the bed?
It's rare... but there are cases where people go for years without sleep.  They diagnosed Jason with simple insomnia... but that's not what it looks like to me. He has every indication of having _insomnolesence_.
Uh-huh...
Alone... but with a murderous fury inside him... which led him to kill dozens of people.
Great. Now there's _two_ serial killers on the loose.
You have been hearing the sordid side then.
You could say we represent the <u>un</u>official view of a well-ordered society.
You were his friend.  One link is all they need.
I'm trying to find things out myself -- that's the whole point.
What an extraordinary request!
It's my last and final one.
Not necessarily.  A <u>wife</u> would.
I've never seen him.  I don't believe there is a keeper of the files.
Not today, Burgel.  Send one of your memos, write up one of your communiques, but for God's sake don't bother me today.
You're just doing your job.
I did not realize it was obligatory.
Oh, I know you got along with that poor fellow -- what was his name?
-- Eduard --
He would have.  You were his best friend.  A better friend than me.
That he was -- satisfied in that regard.  I didn't want to pry.
This morning it was suggested to me that my own sense of office fellowship could bear improving.
As long as it's on their terms. If your work and your private life don't correspond to their specifications you're labelled a dangerous agitator -- with no recourse whatsoever.
The very fact that they're authorities should give you reason. People will do anything to protect their own interests.  For all you know he was killed at the <u>hands</u> of the police.
-- What could he have done to warrant that?
And you ...?
He was murdered.
At the cost of others?  You accuse people of murder without trial -- apparently without irony.  Did you go to the Castle with Eduard?  Then you have no idea what really might have happened that night at all -- even before or after he got there.
Of course it could -- Burgel's been trying to get me thrown out as long as I can remember.  <u>He</u> could've killed Eduard.
And Burgel is the bringer of messages, isn't he?
Usually.
Now Burgel's one of the authorities?
Should I tell you why I joined our late lamented nihilists? Why I became a murderer? Because murder ... is bliss.  It's easier than you might think to absorb and assimilate Evil -- once you've adopted its procedure.
I know better than you what people will say when they have to.  When they brought me in for questioning I informed on my friends the very first day.
Engaged in the manufacture and distribution of ... pills and so forth.
I don't think he really had any. He had no family either.
What makes you think so?
Anyway, I'd like you to reflect that in me you have -- I won't say a friend, because we're complete fencers, of course -- from distinctly incompatible social classes -- but to some extent, shall we say, an interested third party.
-- Should you happen upon anything that might be relevant.
I can't make a simple statement without him taking issue with it
It's a farce.
I had the grandest of financial plots in mind, the most malevolent of personal motives, conspiracy theories extending to every ... authority I could see.  And I find you.  A body snatcher.
Dr. Murnau was the bravest of men. He spent an entire career in those backwaters with no regard for personal gain.  A great loss.
These laws have been with us for centuries -- how can you doubt them?
Oskar.
Gabriela Rossman was here looking for you.  Do you know her?
Amerika for us!
You're outta your depth here, Miss Darrow!
Photography teaches you nothing, Ann! Click! One second and you've seen all you're going to see. I want you sitting here with your paper and pencils ... I want to see every chisel mark reproduced with painstaking accuracy. Understand the carving and you will understand the people! That Ann, is the key to archaeology.
There's nothing fast enough to catch that. Forget it. It's over.
I'm not sailing with this thing on board!
I tell you it doesn't exist!
They' re dead.
The girl's dead, Driscoll. There's no point continuing on.
I can't get back to the wall! I'll get eaten!
Coz of something I lost.
Oh you've got to. He does such fun things with imagery. And I've been reading The Fall --  -- The Fall by Ahlbair Camoo -- it's the same thing, you know the imagery --
She was with you after she left Frank.
Well she's not now.  I did everything for Arlyn. I loved Arlyn I took her right into my apartment, my own sweet apartment on First. But she wouldn't stay off it -- the junk -- and I wept and I pleaded and I held her in my arms - and she started taking things, my things, and selling them for horse. My clothes. We could've had everything together, everything -- and then the bitch sold my mink!
And nobody could tell me who he was -- an exiled prince or a mercenary or a bullfighter or -- but I felt it stirring inside me, this -- this wild, pagan feeling --
Do you always have to repeat?
Didn't want you.
You said someone killed them, you said you know who, you said that.
Is that why Klute didn't tell me?
No, that's not --
All right, then, an ordinary matter. I'm a quite well off man, I have a -- position to respect. I would feel personally uncomfortable to be connected with a -- certain kind of woman, I'm sure you understand. Do you? Well I'd like to buy Jane McKenna's book.
Yes.
Excuse me Miss Daniel?
But you can't say that Dumper was Tom Grunemann.
I can't say he was anybody!
What about everything since?
Mm? Oh, he was my old man. We broke up.
No.
Didn't he tell you what you wanted?
Yeah, you got to me.
Oh don't be all hypocrite. Or do you really like other kicks? Is it more just having power over someone? -- so you don't really need to --
What the hell do you think's the matter.  I could wait for you someplace.
Just let me know when you are going out and where --
I told you before, you wouldn't understand.
Arlyn was a junkie; I'm not on junk!
No, you can find some other way.  Explain it to me. Bree, show me any sense to --
I am.
Look at me. I'm pretty and sort of clever and very well intentioned, and dear God I'd tear your heart out!
Well there's a couple --
It has to be Tom. You said he ripped up his own pictures, he --
Not Tom. Whoever it was left a kind of souvenir, I told you, in her clothing. Semen. The laboratory got a blood group reading from that. The man was blood type 0; Tom was an AB.
You were hired to look for Tom, not someone.
All right. All right --  John, just sit tight will you? I'll read your report, I'll discuss it with the others. I'll be back next Thursday, we'll talk the whole thing over then. Nothing til Thursday, all right?
Two years ago? Sorry.
OK and one of them  Jane McKenna -- she blows a little jealous of Bree - you know? -- Bree comes first? And evidently she knew the freak --- that he was a dumper -- she conned me into passing him to Bree, you know, so Bree'd get hurt. I didn't know. Till afterwards.
I want to know how Tom Grunemann got mixed up in it.
Did she talk about him to you?
Has she talked with you since prison?
He called this morning from Tuscarora. Asked me to meet him at 3:00 at the downtown heliport. He's on his way to Chicago.
Unknown, unidentified and unwanted. And there's more every day man, there's more everyday.
Yeah.
Yes sir, we know he --
What about your mommy?
Welcome to the... 
Soon.  Very soon.
Sorry.
Mom, I mean dad?
I guess...
Uh huh...
C'mon, Billy.  I'm trying to work for God's sake...
Je-sus Christ!  I catch all kind of shit at the office because I'm not pulling my weight because I'm busting my butt trying to be a decent goddamn father and--
That's terrific.  That's really terrific, but I notice I'm the one that's cleaning up this--  Oh, crap, I'll have to do this one over.
I'm sorry.
No.
I don't care.  I hate it.  I want pizza.
I love you...
It's okay, son...I'm here... Just a little more to go... Don't worry, son...I'm here...
Right.
No, she never did.
What did you do when you were little?
Where will my toys be?
Sustained.
Overruled.
I do not, your honor, however--
This is an isolated incident, counselor, unless you can prove otherwise.
And would you describe those years as happy?
The first couple, yes, but after that it became increasingly difficult.
Yes.  I tried to talk to Ted-- my ex-husband--about it, but he wouldn't listen.  He refuses to discuss it in any serious way. I remember one time he said I probably couldn't get a job that would pay enough to hire a baby- sitter for Billy.
Because my son is here.  And his father is here.  As a mother, I don't want my child to be separated from his father.
Objection!
And yet you fired him.
Look, you don't understand.  I need a job.  I've got a kid and--
Call up the people at J. Walter Thompson.  Set up an appointment at four.
No.
More than three, less than thirty- three--permanently?
We were married two years before the baby.  And then four very difficult years.
So, you were a failure at the longest, most important relationship in your life.
I consider it less my failure than his.
Okay, okay...What is it this time? What did I do now?...
I'm not taking him with me.
He is...  You sat in that coffee shop across from school--
Are you out of your mind?! You're the one that walked out on him, remember?
Joanna, I don't give a--
Ted, do you love him?
Oh, God...Oh, my God...
No more waiting in Coffee Shops ...I promise.
I don't know, Jim...
Are you firing me, Jim?
Oh, for God's sake, Kramer. You have got to be the world's most naive human being.  Murray has gone in and changed every single ad you've done on the entire Fire and Ice campaign. Every layout...Every idea...Every single thing, right down the line.
Kramer...There's something I ought to tell you.
No.  Uh, uh.  Tell him I asked for it Friday.  I want it Friday. Period.
I can't tell you how sorry I am.
It's going to cost.
Ted?  Are you there?
Any prospects?
No.
I'm gonna keep him, why?
Thelma, I've lost my wife, I'm not losing my child.
You're on your own, understand?
D'you think you and Charley'll ever get back together again?
Look,  I know this isn't gonna make any sense, okay?  I mean forget the logic part...But I keep thinking if Charley really loved me, he wouldn't have let me divorce him.
Not for a couple of months. The last time I heard from her she was living in San Francisco.
Sure.
What?
Where are you from?
Your people are very brave. They are fighting the Chinese. No one can stop them. Not even me.
Khambas are wild men.
Where will you keep them?
I will buy them for you.
The People's Liberation Army pays for all food and lodging.
The Sera monks have surrendered?
With much bloodshed.
Far, far away.
I miss my brother.
My first and foremost duty is to protect my people. I feel sure of this. And, things change. Maybe not right away, maybe not soon. But I believe this -- things will change.
Is that true or pretend?
The people will cry when they learn you are gone. But they would all want you safe.
Do you remember the day I came to your monastery, when I was a baby? And you comforted me?
Hmm.
Like my mother.
Oh yes.  I killed him.
No.  Do you?
We won't let him get hurt, Ma'am.
My department doesn't have any record of that, Mrs. Bickerman.
<u>No</u>, <u>I</u> <u>did</u> <u>not</u>.  The crocodile <u>did</u> kill him, though. But it was all... it was a mistake.
Thank you, Officer Fuckmeat.
Go ahead.
Thank you.
Deep down, gut check.  I'm growing fond of <u>you</u> and it's liberating to say so.
You don't want to cut me down. 'Cause I'll kill you.
So profound and fat.
I just have this feeling everything's totally safe.
I see blood.  Maybe you got him, Hank.
He never said "go".
<u>Forget</u> <u>it</u>.
Are you sure?
Yes.  You may.  But maybe... I don't know...
So I don't like tents, why--
Excuse me?
When you get scared, the brain releases a chemical, same chemical it releases when somebody's...  in high school, the thing to do was to take the girl to a scary movie.
I couldn't believe... did you see the size of that thing's mouth?
Just gotta pull it a little tighter.
We seem to say goodnight a lot.
<u>Calm</u> <u>down</u>.
Okay.
Good idea.
Keep firing!
He heeds a tourniquet.
Ready.  A museum in New York sent us some additional back up.
You gonna dig up that lady's husband?
Other than to eat us?
Sorry.  I'm just a little unclear as to why the Museum of Natural History would send somebody here.
I got nothing against--
Was he swallowed?
You threw it at me!!
Look.
Look ten feet into the water.
Oh, well then I'm sure that's it, he got killed by a dinosaur, anything else?
I'm not going to Maine, I won't even go west of Forty-third Street--
Part of our research--
Not random at all, maybe. Like there's some pattern here...?
Safe, SHIT, he's got a gun! Getmeout. GET ME OUT!
Gun. Jesus. Turn in the ID as soon as you get back. The gun, too. Be on the next plane, Starling, there's one in 90 minutes.
But then he had to cover up, make her seem just like all the rest of them. That's what Lecter was hinting!
Good idea.
That wasn't me.
Oh.
Sir, that's a field job. It's outside the scope of my assignment. And I've got a test tomorrow on -
What he does with them - takes privacy... Time, tools... He's in his 30's or 40's - he's got real physical strength, but combined with an older man's self-control. He's cautious, precise, never impulsive... This won't end in suicide, like they often do.
Good idea. Meantime, try to get a feel for Catherine Martin. Her apartment, her friends... how he might've stalked her. I'm going to the other two clinics, Minnesota and Ohio.  Now's the hardest part, Starling. Use your anger, don't let it keep you from thinking. Just keep your eyes on Catherine. We've got less than 30 hours.
But I just became a private citizen. I can go anywhere I want to.
Yes sir. Thank you, sir...
No way. She had a guy, I'da known, believe me. Sewing was her life, she was really great at it. Poor Freddie.
You get to travel around and stuff? I mean, better places then this?
"We" being the Behavioral Science Unit, at Quantico. You're one of Jack Crawford's, I expect.
I am, yes.
We're talking about psychology, Doctor, not the Bureau. Can you decide for yourself whether or not I'm qualified?
Advancement, of course.  Go to Split City. See Miss Mofet, an old patient of mine. M-O-F-E-T... Now go. Go.  I don't think Miggs could manage again so soon, even if he is crazy - do you?
Why? Do you know something about him?
Ahhh... Why?
Or doesn't this all begin to suggest to you a kind of... negotiation? There's something Crawford can give me, and I want to trade for it. I even wrote to him, offering my help. But he hates me, so he won't deal directly.
I've been in this room for eight years, Clarice. I know they will never, ever let me out while I'm alive. What I want is a view. I want a window where I can see a tree, or even water. I want to be in a federal institution, away from Chilton - and I want a view. I'll give good value for it. Crawford could do that for me, but he won't. You persuade him.
By the book, he's a sadist.
No. He was strong, he lasted almost a month. My mother - died when I was very young, so my father had become - the whole world to me... After he left me, I had nobody. I was ten years old.
I - ran away...
I've studied the case file, have you...? Everything you need to find him is right in these pages. Whatever his name is.
Then tell me how.
Anger, social resentment, sexual frus-
No, he covets. That's his nature. And how do we begin to covet, Clarice? Do we seek out things to covet? Make an effort to answer.
We don't reckon time the same way, Clarice. This is all the time you'll ever have.
Yes...! They were screaming.
Dr. Lecter -
Why did they turn back?
The Bible. Monarchy. Many wrong ideas about the government of men. My father's people already know each man is his own nation. And only he can have dominion over himself. Not kings. No man is better than any other man.
Miss.  May I?
Do not.  Promise me.
I don't know. Whatever happens you stay with your father. You stay among the officers.
You do not know what you are saying!
Day and a half  Where did you get... the guide?
Came across the war party, tracked 'em.
Fort Edward, then?
England does not protect me and does not war against France on our account. She uses us to war against France on her own account...  of greed for land and furs.
We'll see in the morning...
Easy for you to suppose. While it is their women and children, not yours, alone in their farms!
You forget yourself!
I know.  One has to give Americans "reasons" and make agreements to get them to do anything at all.  Tiring, isn't it?  But that's the way of it here.
I thought British policy is 'Make the World... England', sir.
Yes. You may.  You there. What does Munro call you?  The "Scotsman" has sent one of his Indian allies to guide you.
And who empowered these provincials to pass judgment upon England's policies in her own colonies? To come and go without so much as a "by your leave."
Death and honor are sometimes thought to be the same. Today I have learned that they are not.
Fire!
Gifts?
This interview's over! The militia stays!
Munro would. But General Webb will not send their soldiers across the salt lake.  Having let them go, I fear I will only fight the same men again when I move south.  And yet, I cannot break the terms of the capitulation and sully the lilies of France...
Carry them to England to your King with pride.
Well, I'll be on the golf course in the morning.  Then, if I don't have any babies to deliver--
Pretty good imitation of a hangover and I ought to know.
For this...you don't need to be.
Well, if they were perfecting an aquaman, then why's there a dead one onboard that Russian ship?  Why isn't he out swimming around?
What?...
One of those chunks of Sixpack!  Like a big leech, with those teeth!...
I am thinking, man!  You think I want to die!  I am thinking!  I--
What?
Roger...  More light, Sixpack...
I can't see them!
You're only twenty-five tons off quota.  Barring an unforeseen problem you should reach it easily on the last day.  It's just a day off.  You don't have to take it, I just thought it might help.
Uh..Excuse me sir, it's the air recirculating system, sir...
Is this a contract violation, Mr. Cobb?
Okay.
Better let the Doc take a look at you, after dinner.
No...she killed herself.
What you don't understand is that my crew is in jeopardy.
Do it.
It wouldn't make any difference in there...He could be two feet away and on fire and she'd still not see him!
It...almost got you.
Itches like hell.
Take it off and let me have a look.
Shhhh...don't tell no one.  Job security.
Oh man, that's just great...
At the bottom of a bottle and has been for two days; it's hit him hard.
It's happening tomorrow morning. Get back here now.
That inspires confidence, that does.
I thought this was a pub.
We made a deal for everything inside the cabinet.
Yeah, Bazza, what?
Yes?
Er, yeah, sure, I'll have 'em.
No chance of you lifting this sunbed up is there?
All right, furry muff.
That's no way to answer the phone.
Shit, Dog, there's a lot. Don't you want to do this next door?
We're not going next door until we've flayed these dead men walking. Count it out the back. I don't want them seeing you fingering that money as soon as they walk in.
I mean it, there is only three of us here.
And the weed?
Well we have got about a hundred thousand pretty pieces of paper with the Queen on it. Will that do?
Where the hell are we supposed to hide?
Tom?
A hundred grand.
No, you need five hundred grand to see me.
Of course you are. All right, Ed.
Bloody hell, Tom! This is a bit heavy. This is London, not the Lebanon' Who do you think I am?
They look nice, I agree . . . but lacking in criminal credibility, aren't they? I might get laughed at. How much do you want for these muskets?
Tom, you're all heart.
Nick the Greek.
I would take a pain in the arse for half a million.
You would take a pain Ã­n the arse full stop.
We also need a fucking money counter, William! We have to get the money out by Thursday and I'll be buggered if I am counting it . . . and if you have to get your sodding fertilizer, couldn't you be a little more subtle?
And those stupid girls who hang out with them--
I can't take any more school.
Don't try to con me, Amado. You knew how they got all those things.
That makes it okay?
Save your breath. That line doesn't cut it with me.
Who's "they"?
Because it's a job?
Business is booming. Got your drugs, got your illegals--had a shooting the other night at Big O's--Soldier got ventilated.
Gonna pull a lot of jobs out of this county.
Who said anything about shootin' anybody?
Do I seem jumpy?
Least he never called me that. With me, it was always "high-strung." "My Bunny might have done something with her life, she wasn't so high-strung." Or "tightly wound," that was another one. You seeing anyone?
It wasn't just you, Bunny.
No, it wasn't, was it? You didn't exactly throw yourself into it heart and soul, did you?
Come on in--
Come on in.
There was a bunch of 'em You never met. Me neither.
Go out through the back.
The Trail of Tears.
So they stayed in Florida?
You know who I am?
I got a pretty good guess.
Well--
I mean, just 'cause he didn't--you know--
I finished that. I'm just messing around.
Fine. I'm pretty much moved in.
He does.
Made some money, came back here--
Something like that.
Looks like a lot of cactus to me.
Man knows a hundred-fifty varieties of beer, he can't tell a poinsettia from a prickly pear.
You get the feeling he doesn't want to be here?
Her parents acted like I was gonna blow my nose on their curtains--
Well--I don't see what's changed. No - PDA's, no necking on the obstacle course.
We should just do it.
You could take it--
Pleased to meet you.
You joke about it, Sam, but we are in a state of crisis. The lines of demarcation has gotten fuzzy--to run a sucessfull civilization you got to have lines of demarcation between right and wrong, between this one and that one--your Daddy understood that. He was like the whatchacallit-- the referee for this damn menudo we got down here. He understood how most people don't want their sugar and salt in the same jar.
You get much of that in here?
So tell me why I shouldn't make this place off-limits.
Well, you're the Man out there now, aren't you? It's your call.
I haven't seen anybody doing that.
Bandidos, Injuns--
No te molestas. Tenemos a ella. [Don't worry. We've got her.]
Don't tell me lies, Enrique. Que paso?
Tipico.
King wasn't Mexican, Fenton--
Bad enough all the street names are in Spanish--
--but Buddy Deeds was my salvation.
Bledso
He owned the colored roadhouse before Big O--
Forensics people are sure of it. You have any idea who might have put him there?
Charley Wade.
I got an idea what happened.
Steve?
All my mother does is work. That's how you get to be Spanish.
The old-high-school-heartthrob Sheriff. I thought you were crazy about each other. He's available, you're available--
Maybe you're just getting less patient.
If you spent a little more time training them--
Did you come here to tell me how to run my business?
What? Become a nun? You didn't want me going out with Anglos--
So you must remember Sheriff Wade.
You had to deal with him in running the club.
No. Is he sick?
I have new respect for some of my kids, meeting the parents they've been dealt--
I could name five girls at school who have one just like it--
Oh, my mother wanted to keep me away from away from boys.
You stop growing that loco weed at your place, you'd see a lot more daylight.
And your mother was a saint. That summer I built the patio at your house? She made me lunch every day.
I can't name anybody she does like these days.
A real palace. She rattles around alone in that thing--
Yeah.
Nice-looking kid.
Pilar--
Yeah?
Try a year and a half. He bands her an old snapshot. PILAR looks at it--
I remember thinking you were the one part of my life Buddy didn't have a piece of--
Everything that went before, all that stuff, that history--the hell with it, right?
Gotta be in person.
Just doing my job.
White man just using you to keep the Black man down.
Sure.
For Frontera? Hell, I can't remember dates no more. I do recall it was after an affair of the heart had gone sour on him. He almost took some poor fella's head off at the Legion in Arroyo Grande, and figured it was time to move on.
The other one? Hell, at my age, every time you learn a new name you got to forget an old one. Your head's all crowded up--here it is--
Tell him he can keep them. The Bellboy looks puzzled.
Nix?
It'll be something hokey.
I mean, there's no instructions--  What do you mean, they're not tricks?
Yes.
Did your husband know Quaid?
You don't?
I can be very persuasive.
Just curious.  Back to business.  Ever heard of a man called Nix?  Dorothea?
Okay.  I'll keep digging.
Yes.  You do that.
It was more than that, I think.
I told you --
No.
No it isn't.  You can't help me.
And Pimm and Swann.  Only Nix was ready for them.
I left three messages already.
Sure.
No.  I'm not going near him.
I think we walk a narrow path, between... between...
I heard he was the best.
Fuck you.
I need to speak to you, Mr. D'Amour.  About last night.
Illusions are trickery. Magicians do it for real.
I don't think the dead much care.
Left alone?  Somebody's been murdered.
No.
Yes.
And then... because I was getting too close to something --  --or someone, you called Swann
... Looks like you're going... to lose... one more.
Yeah.  You could say that.
The Puritan?
You shouldn't have followed me, D'Amour.
Or murdered, like Nix.
Didn't know you read minds.
And you're not?
Looks that way.
Yes?
I don't want to think about it. If I think about it he'll hear me. He'll find me.
Swann?
Yes! Yes!
I should have been honest with you, right from the start.  I wasn't born to show people the error of their ways.  I was born to murder the world.
Ok, you're scheduled to leave Saturday, but we'll hold a seat Thursday in case, but first class is full, you're waitlisted for an upgrade... there might be a seat on Lufthansa...
Philosophy.
Hi. Did you have a nice swim?
No way.
I see them every morning.
No, yes, it does...
But, I'm mean.
That's too scary.
But, it's great being with them, after they can talk, and can do things with you.
That's nice. My parents were always traveling, they weren't around so much.
Yeah, look at that thing.
Yeah.
Do you know where we are?
Around.
Tomorrow.
That's what you said the other night.
I'm just leaving.... do you have my jacket?
Yes, no.
Can I enter?
That's ok.
Tomorrow.
Do you want I send it to your room?
What?
No, I thought it was funny. Forget it.
That's ok.
Oh... that's nothing, someone gave it to me.
You don't have to be embarrassed.
It's probably trivial.
Weird.  The book again.  Sex spelled backwards...
I must really be slacking off.  Hungry?
Says she can get me in to see this killer.
Claire...
This is the person...you were talking about?
Quiet.  Real quiet...
Just me.
My secretary?
Of course not.  They put him through severe mental stress.  Causing this aneurysm.
It's the patient's request, doctor.
Father Jeremy and Deacon John Townsend of St. Ursula's, and our associate, Maya Larkin.  Secular assistants are permitted if regarded as qualified.  Maya is eminently qualified.
Maya, for the last time, I will not tolerate these obsessions.
He will.  He has great faith.
You know how I feel.  The world is random.  The only certainty I believe in is death.
You killed my parents.
...art sank, sun set, ark sank again...
Peter...Peter Kelson.
Peter Kelson?
Listen, I'm sorry, but I'm running late.
That there is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."
What if I told you I was a malignant narcissist?
Well, by saying that, you're acknowledging the existence of a higher power.  Which, to a narcissist, is impossible.
Well, then it all seems to be working out for you.  Listen, Ms...?
What's that got to do with you?
What do you mean?
What's the...OH SHIT!
I see things.  My worst fears.  You need to know something, Peter.  I was possessed once.  Like Birdson.  It took Father Lareaux six days to pull me out of it.
Maybe that's my problem.
So, what does it mean.  The ark sank and the sun set?
Sure of what?  Who cares if this guy is devoid of faith or sleeps over a pentacle?  Results are what Lareaux would want.
I'll be at Bedford tonight, if you need me.
It's Detective Smythe.
Thanks for having me, Sally.
Of course.
It's another day.  I think I'm alright.
Had to let her go.  I see you thinkin' there, superstar. Don't.
Fine, you don't like this one, which one would you rather wear?
Nothing.  So good luck.
His mother had a cookout a few weeks ago. He could do a lot better if you ask me.
Find out where they're registered and send them a gift.
How is she alright looking the way she does?
What'd you do?
It was the least we could do.  And I love to cook.
You love to pose so much, let's see it again.
I want you to stand like that until you're sick of it because I don't ever want to see it again, you hear me?  Dora, take her spot.
We've got our final games against Oregon and Oregon State and I want to shake things up a bit, so I'm starting you at point again.
You could make a career by telling me where.
You might be the only one with a job.
I don't know sometimes.
Just cause I don't kiss her booty like you...
I told him you looked like me.
Oh, great.
Yeah, once I cut them off.  Why?
But?
What's up, Sidra.
I wouldn't know.
My Mom says she doesn't know where I come from 'cause I act different.
He's alright, but my Dad can take him.
Man, forget you then, stupid.
Last time they won, Dr. J. was a nurse.
Yeah, an honest tramp-ass ho.  But I guess you'll stick your dick in anything.
Didn't know you cared so much.
He ain't Spalding.
I know, right?
Yeah.
I'm telling you, Coach wishes she was here instead of me.
I know a lot of brothers dog their wives, I just never thought my pops would do some shit like this...
I'm not up for running into anybody. Let's just kick it here, alright?
Nah.  I have curfew.
You weren't at my game.
We're going to get some food.
Cheap date.
I just said I didn't fuck around.  But you got your head so far up your ass it took a cheap date for you to notice me.
I don't think so.
Well, I tried sneaking in after college, but they found breasts during my physical.
Then why are you so upset?
C'mon, girl, you live next door.  Who's been creeping?
Well, can you give him this for me?
Nona, please.
Okay.
You hearing me?
Said he'd be home later.
Sorry.  You okay?
Anyway, I gotta get to this meeting. Tell your Mom I'm gonna be late.
Well, tell them to mind their damn business.  You're smart enough to get a degree.
You know how much higher the play level is in the NBA?  Give yourself time to develop, Quincy.  Get an education.  The NBA ain't going nowhere.
So now you're saying my mother trapped you?
Look, I'm busy.
Quincy.  I know you left school early to throw your middle finger up at me.
You ok?
Call 911, Mary, do it right now.
Nothing's wrong, I just got some guy on the phone on my other line, he's says he works for this guy, this guy who's Frank's father --
It's a helluva disease.
Sure is.  So why call me?
I'M NOT CRAZY.  You're the one.  You're the one who's wrong.  You're the one --
I'm dying, Claudia.  I have cancer. I have cancer and I'm dying, soon. It's metastasized in my bones and I --
Well if you keep listenin' to the music that loud you're not only gonna damage your ears but your neighbors ears.
No.
Who was it?
It's fine.
ok.
Yeah.
Arlight, then.  Cheers.
Okey-doke.
Oh, see?  This is great.  Ten o'clock.
Well, that's a natural thing, two people go out on a date, something.  They want to impress people, the other person...or they're scared maybe what they say will make the other person not like them --
So you've done it --
Well I don't go out very much.
-- well I'm a real...y'know, straight when it comes to that...curse words I just don't use much --
ok.
What's your name?
It doesn't matter.
Where's Richard and Julia?
C'mon, Dad.  We gotta just GET HIS MONEY AND GO, LET'S GO. Let's get the money --
Son, please, now....
No Can Do.
C'mon, man, just watch me, watch and listen --
Go. Hurry up. Let's go.
I'm almost done.
Check that ego - come off it - I'm the profit - the proffesor Ima teach you 'bout The Worm, who eventually turned to catch wreck with the neck of a long time oppressor And he's runnin from the devil, but the debt is always gaining And if he's worth being hurt, he's worth bringin' pain in - When the sunshine don't work, the Good Lord bring the rain in.
Well you lost me with the last couple of cocktail words spoken, m'boy, but I believe it's that sort of love. Sounds nice to me.
And I'm listening avidly, fellow.
My name is Donnie Smith and I have lot's of love to give.
This sounds Sad as a Weeping Willow.
"Why don't you shut the fuck up," is me to you, Chapter Right Here, Verse Right Now.
Phil's one of the nurses from the service?
Where is he?
Get a girlfriend.
When was the last time you talked to your son?
...cocksucker....
Do me a personal favor --
She's my love...my life...love of it... In school when you're 12 years old. In school, in six grade....and I saw her and I didn't go to that school...but we met. And my friend knew her...I would say, "What's that girl?"  "How's that Lily?" "Oh, she's a bad girl...she sleeps with guys..."  My friend would say this....but then sometime...I went to another school, you see? But then...when high school at the end, what's that?  What is that?  When you get to the end?
....getthat on the tv....there...
I'm looking for Frank Mackey.
Yeah.  You have the wrong number. There's no one named Frank here.
You got us a room so quick?
Like I said, yeah --
Are you asking me that?
Yes.
Mm. Hm.
Go ahead and waste your time.
You requested my time and I gave it you, you called me a liar and made accusations. And you say, "If I'd known I wouldn't have asked," then it's not an attack?  Well, I don't wanna be the sort of fella who doesn't keep his word.  I gave you my time, Bitch. So fuck you now.
Hollywood, mainly.
Well I guess it doesn't.
She's not here, she went out. I'm sorry.  This is all just so, I don't know what, what to do -- your Dad asked me to try and track you down. To get you and I did, I called the number -- Do you wanna come in?
For six months.  I'm the day nurse...
You're here.
Marcie.
Ok. Marice why don't you take a seat for me?
I said: I DON'T KNOW.  You can't just come in here and start pokin' around --
THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE!
-- do not do this -- my gun is drawn and If I Have To Open That Closet you will get shot -- Step Out Now.
Did your wife find out?
If she asks me any question I want to tell her.  I want to tell her everything I've done.
Find her, get her and tell her I want to talk to her, Mary.  Fucking hell.
I'm sorry, Stanley.
Slowly or quickly?
I went to see her -- some fuckin' asshole answers the door in his underwear, he's fifty years old, there's coke and shit laid out on the table --
I love you.
You feel like you want to be forgiven for your sins?  Honey, you're not on your death bed, yet....this kinda talk's gonna get you in trouble --
--- don't.  don't.  Please.  Just... listen to me...honey....  ...I've done...I've cheated on you.
The question isn't wether or not you cheated on me, the question is how many times have you cheated on me?
How long with Ellen?
It's over.  I talked to her this morning.
Do you have any children with anyone?
Well maybe.
I'm not mad.  I am, but I'm not.  Y'know?
But you can't say....
Yes you do.
No.
I'm Bob.
Like what?
Like a shrink, like if I go to see a shrink, I'm protected, I can say things -- fuck -- I don't know what I'm doing --
You can't change his will.  Only Earl can change his will.
Well.  Considering that there's no one else mentioned in the will...we'd have to go to the laws of intestacy, which is -- as if someone died without a will --
What does that mean?
Hang up the phone.
PUT THE FUCKIN' PHONE DOWN, HANG IT UP.
Phone number.
818-753-0088.
Ok. One of those.  And...um...Barely Legal?
yeah, I said.  Is that it?
That's it.
Total is $15.29.  Thirty minutes or less.
They just let me have my own study-time, my own reading time in the library.
I got an audition, I won't make it here 'till two, c'mon, I'll see you later. Love you.
What the fuck is goin' on, WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON?
You have prayed too much.  Your mind is weak.
My guards are useless!  Take her from me!
He can learn to be Phillippe in time.  But first he must learn to be Louis, and for that he has two more days.
You said you'd do anything, Athos, anything to replace this King.  So do it.
Hold your goblet with two fingers.
You're a fool!
Perhaps.  But of d'Artagnan I am certain.  What he did tonight was what he told us all along he would do -- be faithful to his King.
There are more important things than tits.
Forgiveness?
The Queen Mother.  Anne.
I don't know about you, but I plan to wait here.
At a ball, everyone watches the King!
You are right.  But it is a trap.
She died giving you to me.  And I want to die knowing it is one the finger of the women my son loves.
We were at her door.  I was just taking the ring from my pocket, for the third time today, when a young Musketeer brought the invitation for her to become a lady-in-waiting for the Queen Mother.
Never mind, Papa, it doesn't matter now.  She loved me once.  I want to die remembering that.
You can't drink with a friend you haven't seen in months?
Another?  How many times have you saved his life in this year alone? Three?  Four?
Raoul is everything to me.
I came to see you safely out.  Check for yourself.
Your mother's.
Just... water.
And you never knew why?
Mademoiselle Michelle Beaufort.  She is betrothed to Raoul, the son of Athos the Musketeer, who has served France through many tribulations.
Order Fromberge to keep him in safety!  It is the least you can do, to protect your own honor!
Thank you, your Majesty.
It shall be done, your Majesty.
Eh?
... Nothing.
Enough of this, our dinner waits.
This is more than you are used to. Your mother is a seamstress, your father is dead.  You have three younger sisters, two of whom suffer from consumption.  Don't look so surprised, Kings know such things.
You would do that, your Majesty?
If you don't want to be so appealing, why did you touch the rose to your skin?  Where was it? Here?
No, you may wait behind the screen.
I did not want to upset you.  It was tragic.  I did everything I could for him.  I ordered him positioned in a spot of complete safety, far from the fighting.  But he disregarded my wishes and charged into danger.
What do you need?
So what?
No I mean ours, motherfucker! If I go down everyone's going with me - you and your crew especially! You won't get protection, you won't get the trucks - nothing!
We're all gonna fan out!  C'mon, let's do a sweep of the alleys -
That's got to our secret agent man! Do we have an address?
She stole my car!!
Nothing!  He didn't do nothing!
That's great Zydowski, you tech guys are really on the ball.  Harding - call the print lab at the FBI, run the prints through their library, see if it's less screwed-up than ours...
They found the getaway Mercedes a parking garage north of Venice. It checks out.
Six months ago, a police lieutenant named Charles Fletcher was found dead in a hotel room - he blew his brains out - left no note, you may have heard of it...
I was there, and it was no suicide. He was killed by professionals.  I was in the bathroom when it happened.
Well where are ya, what are ya, drunk?
Tubbs listen!  I don't know anywhere else to go!  I need your help!
Look, Jimmy, you know, I haven't seen you in eight years, you show up to my door like you're on drugs - now the least you could do is tell me what the fuck is going on!
It was self-defense, Tubbs! They're dirty!  I walked in on something, I don't know what -
I have nowhere else to go, Tubbs, I need your help!
What?
I asked him not to tell me where he was going.  I told him I don't want any part of it.
Yeah, and that's all I'm going to say. If you want to arrest me, go ahead...
He doesn't think you run mind games on him.
He's an eideteker. He has almost total recall.  But I don't think he's psychic.  What he has it empathy and projection.  He can assume your point of view and mine.., and some other points of view that scare and sicken him.
Could he handle a direct contact?
The usual motivation doesn't apply to him, nor the way he uses them.  I don't have an answer for you.  Listen to me, my friend: leave this.
How are Molly and the boy?
Kevin and Molly are on their way to Montana.  Who the hell is he to do this to my family, Sidney? Answer me that...!
He'd know it from articles he's read about Lecktor...
That could be the tip of a 't.  Here and here. And here.
You're his friend, Jack. Why can't you leave him alone?
Nobody's better with evidence. But he has the other thing, too. He doesn't like that part of it...
How much do you know?
Blond, right-handed, really strong, wears a size eleven shoe. The prints are all smooth gloves. He's on a full moon cycle. Both times. His blood is AB Positive.
You don't need me. I wouldn't be useful to you anymore, Jack.
I am all right.
That's narrow?
There's no connection between the families.
There's some film cans in the far corner of the room underneath one of the windows.
They got shot a Telex. They're on if now...
Put your back against the door. Come forward three steps until you feel the tile on your feet and there will be a stool just to your left.
What's being photographed?
In eight days.
I'll see you later. All right?
Francis...?
No.
Was I in an accident?
I don't want to know.
Oh, God.
Absolutely,
Uh... sure...
Where did you get it?!
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Tenth and Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C.
3680 DeSoto Highway. Marathon, Florida.
And you said?
At the store. You doin' some good?
None you'd notice. I'm lonely...
Which part? That or the day-to-day.
Will you be in Atlanta for a while? I'm not buggin' you about coming home, I just wondered.
Good for him.  Thanks a lot, Freddie!  Kevin. We're going grocery shopping.
I'd like one of your cigarettes, please.
Will?  You could come up here.
Yes. Is Molly there?
Tell her I called.
Thanks.
Crabs would get most of the newborns before they made it to the sea, huh?
I'll hang around in here. I'll just be in the kitchen, Mom...
I was in the psychiatric wing. It bothers you, finding out I was in there... doesn't it?
We don't know that.
...yes.
Stuart is fine.
There are things you don't have. Research materials... I could speak to the Chief of Staff...?
Then by implication, you think that you are smarter than me, since you caught me.
You're insane.
Because, my dear Will, if this Pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the full moon, he might go outside and look at it.  Have you seen blood in moonlight, Will? It appears quite black. If one were nude, it would be better to have outdoor privacy for this sort of thing.
It's not 'interesting'. You thought of it before.
I haven't decided yet.
You know Lounds's enlightened me on one thing: your confinement in the mental hospital. My attorney should have brought that our in court.
When you were so depressed after you shot Mr. Garrett Jacob Hobbs to death, it wasn't the act that got you down. Didn't you really feel so bad because killing him felt so good?  And why shouldn't it feel good?! It must feel good to God. God does it all the time!
...commercially prohibited.  Number Twelve shot in liquid Teflon in a copper casing. On impact it all opens up in the target. Expect the recoil. They're hot loads.  Body armor?
You got it.
No.  Caspiar.
I told you, I'm not a comedian.  And sitcoms are the lowest form of entertainment: Stupid jokes and canned laughter.
That's alright.  Where...?
Yeah, we can have a garage sale. "Hey look, I got a floor lamp and a network TV Special for only fifty cents!"
But George, I like to push the boundaries...
Oh no!  Did he get hurt?
He is the Southern Heavyweight Champion.  He'll kill you.  First, you piss-off women.  Then you piss-off the South.  Then you get killed!  And I did the bookings.
It's visualization therapy.  He's helping me turn inward and fight the disease.
Do you wanna tour the clubs?
Yeah!  He's a psychic surgeon in the Philippines, and he's amazing!  He rubs you and sucks the disease right out!
Oh!
Do you wanna wrestle?  It's a good way of breaking the ice.  That instant physical intimacy really brings two people together.
I mean -- uh -- the colors in the sky are so vibrant.  I love this time of day.
I can shtop whenever I want...
Andy, you're not horrible.  You're just... complicated.
You're not listening to me --
So?  What do they know?
Absolutely nothing!  That's the beauty!  It's credibility.  You make them love you... and then later, on your special, you'll screw with their heads!
She'll say, "Now my son is a man."
And you say, "Santa, what am I gettin' for Christmas?"  And he says, "Cancer!"
I stopped drinking.  I gave up drugs.  And I'm meditating three hours a day.  It's the center of my life...
We are all impressed.
Yes -- we do not doubt your devotion to TM.  But we feel that perhaps... you and the program have grown apart philosophically.
So HELP ME!  All I wanna do is MEDITATE!!
Sure!  But WE think it's kickass! Now I get to be Tony.  I get to dump the glass of water on someone else's head!
Yeah.  They don't know whether to be sad, or angry.
Of course he's in his room.  All his "friends" are in there.
They're gonna lynch him!
Does that surprise you?  It was inevitable.
We have no choice but to continue as planned.  Deploy the sentinels. Immediately.
Lieutenant, you were given specific orders --
No way.  Not possible.
We're going to kill him.  Do you understand that?  He's going to die just like the others.
Yeah, 'course I'm sure.
Shit!  Apoc?
What if he isn't the One, Morpheus? How can you be so sure?
I know, Trinity.  Don't worry.  He's going to make it.
Hello, Neo.  Do you know who this is?
That you are a slave, Neo.  Like everyone else, you were born into bondage, kept inside a prison that you cannot smell, taste, or touch. A prison for your mind.
You've never used them before.
Do you think my being faster, stronger has anything to do with my muscles in this place?
Because... I didn't think I would?
The body cannot live without the mind.
Of the Resistance.
Don't think of it in terms of right and wrong.  She is a guide, Neo. She can help you find the path.
Yeah?  What about the other five guys?  The five before me?  What about them?
Trinity!  Go!  Get to the basement. Find the catch basin!
Yeah.
Not too bright though.
Trinity?  The Trinity?  The Trinity that cracked the I.R.S. Kansas City D-Base?
From what?
Easy, Neo.  Easy.
It disables any electrical system in the blast radius.  It's the only weapon we have against the machines.
Nothing.  Just had a little deja vu.
We have to!
There has to be something that we can do.
I'm not the One, Trinity.  The Oracle hit me with that too.
No, you're not.
They're hacking his mind.
Got it.
You're going to kill him?  Kill Morpheus?!
Follow me.
Look fella...this is private...
Let go of her.
Well, maybe they do that in Riverdale, but down here we take cash.  Now, you got it or not?
And cherry bombs...ash cans...and rockets?
Why?
You are with out a doubt the biggest, most pretentious bullshit thrower I know.  Like to see what kind of business you'd do.
Jewish...
So?
Not quite...but keep trying.
Charlie, I swear on my mother, you're not going to believe this.
Listen...I'm a guest here.
I'm sorry Charlie...I didn't mean it.
I understand.
Charlie, twenty-eight bucks is nothing.  The only way to do it is through your uncle...think about it will you?
Mind your own business.
Forget it.
That bad, huh?
Yeah, thanks, it's ok.
I'll tell you who you can pray for... Next payday, I'll be at Tony's Place...Johnny better show or I find him and break his legs...and I mean it.
Fine.
No, I'm serious...You're really good.
What was it?
"Francis Macomber."
Nobody knows anything, believe me.
CHRIST, you should have seen it. Unbelievable.  The kid would turn around and fire and he would just keep coming at him like Rasputin. That kid was scared.  Not half as much as we were though.
You missed the point.  The kid's a climber...not very bright...but if you get down to his level to look at it his way; he kills a guy who insulted a big man - he gets a reputation.  He thinks he's in good standing.
Watch your language.
Uhuh...probably a good idea.  Why don't you do it this time?
Of all people.  Now say the truth. Do I look like Che Guevara.  C'mon.
Now don't get excited.  Don't get excited!!
The girls like it loud.
Yeah, so things'll be even.
What'sa matter...forget your registration?
Of course!  A double for Michael, Tony.
And isn't it a lovely one?  So sturdy, so straight --
His wife?
Unfortunately.  I sat between them at the Bronx Zoo benefit -- it was better than Seconal.
Very.
Of course.
Do they, m'dear?
You know what I'm saying, Joe?
Well sir, it's 9:30 in the morning.
We've met before, y'know, that White House function, the President had you on his right and you know where I was?
Hello.  I'm Joe Black.  Nice to meet you.
Daddy'll do fine.  Besides, he's got Joe.  And so do you.
'Here'?
I'll make a note of it.  Anything else?
As close as a deal could be.
That's your privilege, Bill.  But given our needs, given the absolute necessity for growth, given the fu- ture, the truth is... joining John Bontecou is every bit as certain as - Death and Taxes.
But the matter's still on the table, Bill --
I'm feeling real uncomfortable right now because the guy who reports to me is threatening me.
The answer is no, quick enough for you?
Quince, m'man, thanks for the offer, but it's all set for just me and Bill. More people might --
Never mind Bontecou.  I've got some other merger possibilities up my sleeve, and I'm putting them to see old man.
Yeah.
-- But he was concerned about the timing?
I from dat nex' place.
Some spot you pick.
None facety, mistah.  You come for me?  Dat's good news.
Hi, Jennifer.
Good morning, Jennifer.
Didn't you call a Board meeting?
But she loves you?
Yeah, it's like you know every inch of each other's souls -- and then you're free.
What would you say if you knew it was me who brought down Bill Parrish?  I told Drew and the Board that Bill depended on you.  Drew led me on, but I had no business telling him in the first place.  He was setting up Bill from day one.  Drew and Bontecou are going to chop up the company and sell it off for parts. Bontecou was outside, Drew was Mr. Inside.  And I was the fool who made it all happen.  Oh God, what do I do?
Drew is none of your damn business. Nor is where I put my mouth.
I have a certain function to per- form, and that seems to take all of my time.  Bu sometimes - uh - I speculate - uh - I haven't left room for - uh - anything else.
Never tried, 'til now.  Joe, may I kiss you?
I don't know who you are.
Yes, he's tired.  I believe so.
Maybe it's the draft through the door.
Yes!
It beats a surgical, doesn't it?
You think so?
Closer than that.
And I won't tell anyone who you are.
You give your word, I give mine -- that we'll do what we say.  It's a truth exchanged between two people.
So you understand the concept then. When you're busy here, your work, what your task is, is being executed elsewhere.
There's one to every rule.
That's what everybody says.
I'm not everybody.
Yes.
Cold lamb sandwiches -- not as chewy as roast beef, not as boring as chicken.  She knew stuff like that.
And I don't need your goddamn permis- sion either!  You!  Drew!  I don't need anyone to tell me how to run my life.
I don't know.
How about you telling me?  When I ask a simple question, I expect a straight answer.  That's what I'm used to.  Anybody who doesn't give it to me, I fire.
Yes, and stop repeating everything I say, and turning it into a question. Spooning, fooling around, God knows what.  You arrive on the scene -- why you picked me, I still don't under- stand --
This universe?
What are you saying, that it's time to go?
How perfect for you -- to take whatever you want because it pleases you.  It's not love --
Then what is it?
Those were my words, Bill.
Well, they're mine now.
It's not necessary, Joe.  Drew's going to step aside --
I'll take it from here --  I am --
'...Yes --'
You're not Death.  You're just a kid in a jacket and a pair of pants.
I'm sorry, I --
'The one' to do what?
What the hell are you talking about?
In return you'll receive minuets, days, weeks, I'm not going to go into details ... what matters is that I stay interested.
Bontecou Day.  Going to close with Big John -- Look at you, Bill, all cool as a cat and over at Bontecou's, I'll bet he's shitting in his pants.
Yeah.  Or the week after.
Sir, I'll deliver the package.
Yeah - Bill - How are you?  You okay?
Fine, fine.  Big doing up here.  Why are you still down here?
The Board's working through the weekend, tying up the loose ends on this damn thing.  But I want to give it one more try, I'm still holding out some hope.
I appreciate this, Eddie, members of the Board, this will just take a minute of your time.  As the custo- dians of the company, you may re- ceive information from what follows that is valuable to you --  -- or not.  Either way, thanks.
Does Drew tell you everything?
Forget about me and Mom -- are you going to marry him?
Probably.
What were you going to say?
Listen, I'm crazy about the guy -- He's smart, he's aggressive, he could carry Parrish Communications into the 21st century and me along with it.
Oh yes, I am.  Not an ounce of excitement, not a whisper of a thrill, this relationship has all the passion of a pair of titmice.
I know.  But I'm the only father you've got.
What?!
Incidentally, 'Joe' what?
Cut it out, Susan.  You and I've got to talk.  Big day tomorrow, everybody.  Joe, let's go.
What is the nature of your interest in Joe?
It's something.
I don't understand.
I'm having a helluva time.
My kid sister.  She just broke up with her boyfriend and she's thinking about dropping out of law school.
I'm sorry --
Nothing to be sorry about.  That's the way with men and women, isn't it?
I would.
I've been thinking... I don't want you to be my doctor.  Because I don't want you to examine me.
Why not?
Like waking. Like you always just woke up.							 *
Just two. So far.							  *
Yeah, well you're not gonna remember, anyway.
Yeah?
I just want you to tell me how you came by that car.
Do you remember me?
Strip!
You did explain, Lenny.
Is that what your little note says?
Why?
She was beautiful. Perfect to me -				*
Sounds perfect? What do I owe you?
Who is he? What have you got me into?
Something feels wrong. I think someone's fucking with me. Trying to get me to kill the wrong guy.
Course not.
He went to meet somebody and didn't come back.
Maybe I can help you find him. I know a			* lot of people.
Yeah?
No!
What happened is that Jimmy went to meet a guy called Teddy. He took a lot of money with him and he didn't come back. Jimmy's partners think I set him up. I don't know whether you know this Teddy or how well -
What then? Love? What would you kill for? For your wife, right?
What?
Jimmy Grantz. Know him?
Did Teddy send you?
Lemme take you down in the basement and show you what you've become.
You're in a playful mood.
Mr Gammell?
Guess I've told you about my condition.
Lenny, you can't trust a man's life to your little notes and pictures.
No. No, just let me think for a minute.
Shut it, Teddy.
Yeah. I think it was your sinister mustache that got him.
Who's she?
The sort of questions you should be asking yourself.
Like how'd you get this car? That suit?
Yeah, well, thanks for the advice.
Like you've told yourself. Over and over. Conditioning yourself to believe. "learning through repetition" -
Why do you keep lying to me?					 *
No. You took them out.						  *
Why would I do that?						    *
My mother calls me Teddy. I'm John Edward Gammell. Cheer up, there's a lot of John		    * G's for us to find. All you do is moan.			* I'm the one that has to live with what			 * you've done. I'm the one that has to put		    * it all together. You just wander around			* playing detective. You're living a dream,		   * kid. A dead wife to pine for and a sense		    * of purpose to your life. A romantic quest		   * which you wouldn't end even if I wasn't			* in the picture.							    *
This bad cop. He checked you into the			  * Discount Inn. Then he's been calling you		    * for days, sticking envelopes under your			* door, telling you shit.						 *
I was the kids' godfather.
And...?
"And" what?
He any good?
Where's the new drop point...?
Sure.
No, you don't, Jim.  'Cause if I close this down, you got nothing to make a phone call about.  And my guys don't have a week for a Feeb bureaucratic process.  Every hour longer they're in there, they risk exposure.  So, right here, right now, they're back in or I pull them out and close you down.  What's it going to be?
Deal.
Really?  So, what is this, a party?
The Keys?
Are you afraid?  Good.  And you don't need a visa. Cause you're with me.
Angola.  My mother was being a surgeon there.  She volunteered. Mozambique and Mali, too...  ...those days, in those days...she was part of Cuba's gift to the third world.  She came from a bourgeois family with a house in Verdado...we still have the house. We will go there...
...'cause we have no future...are of today and not tomorrow.
Maybe I'm only one.
And the chopsticks and fortune cookies?
They're all the same.  "Financial security is around the corner." "Your friends love you."
Would you?  Because if you couldn't, I would be very lonely... I would have left the only world I know and have known since I was seventeen.  But none of this will happen.  So it doesn't matter.  Because we are on the Guajira Peninsula.  And all you see around you...look around... is Archangel de Jesus Montoya- Londono.  He is my man.  And you are a smuggler moving a load...
I'll be on board by noon.
Maybe.  Maybe with the crazy whites.
Sit.
What'd Neptune tell you?
He didn't.  Interrogation's not in our skill set.  So c'mon, what suspicions have you master-minded off these associations?
'Cause she will tell you.
We could try to run loads into these guys.  Run a few loads for Montoya into South Florida.  Into this group.
That way we do not waste AvGas or our motherfucking time.
What happened to the last transporter you <u>had</u>?
Hit a couple of jazz clubs.  Fell back to her place.
No.  Havana, Louisiana.  Don't we have a meet?
No.
Oh, that makes it okay, then.
And what does that level of spending on first-class, private- sector infrastructure signify to you?
Call the US Coast Guard:  "Come and arrest our ass."  And Switek resumes romancing Miss Ukraine...
Twenty on my man...
You're giving away your money, fool...
Detective Crockett.
A C.I. we cut loose to your Joint Interagency Task Force.  Name of Alonzo Stevens.  Now, he's YOUR informant.  Stevens, called us.  I haven't spoken to him for six months. I do not know what case you have him on.  I do not know what he is talking about.  But whatever he is doing for you, it sounds like it is going bad.  Right now...
What are you talking about?
If they ran the rental car or lease on this place...even if it's EPIC database in El Paso...they'd have to work through the layers of bullshit three weeks deep.  Then they'd find your deeper, hidden criminal selves...
Alonzo?  What are you talking about?  Where are you...?
We don't know.  And that's the point.  Maybe there's a mole. Whatever, it's a disaster.  And it's a Joint Interagency Task Force.  I have DEA, ATF, U.S. Customs components in on it.  So the penetration could be from any one agency.  What we do know is I have to suspend operations right now from undercover work through interdictions 'cause I have to assume our Operational Security is blown.
He's talking to you, bro.  What he means to say is he is reluctant to abandon the penetration of a major narcotrafficking organization...
He did volunteer one time...
Nothing.  Calling to say hi... What's up with you?
Good idea.  We'll grab a bite.
A good deal, like this with us, for Burnett will be good only temporarily.  He'll get restless because he believes nothing is forever.  Life is dust, make it while you can.  He's ambitious.
Meaning...?
Uh-uh.  No predetermined places and times to meet.  Give me their heading and radio codes and I will talk to them directly with the longs and lats and time which will be a last minute deal...
You're hoping to get a look at what?
Hers'n zodda meg a livig.
Men, they mostly faggots.
You sure are a pretty lady.
Y -- what in hell starts with Y?
Forget it.
You inviting shee-it.
I'm impressed. You're a killer.
You talk like a man with a tin twat.
What I'm gonna do, I'm gonna make a cowboy outta you, kid. How about that? Build you up a little, teach you couple little tricks'n turn y'out to stud, Rat-stuff.
Don't say nothing about you either.
Twenty bucks...
I'm scared.
You know what's wrong with you? You got fevers. You kinky as a bedbug. How you gonna get to Florida?
Just when everything's going my way, you gotta pull a stunt like this.
I don't even want you to go. Whaddya think of that? I got other plans for my life than dragging around some dumb cowboy that thinks he's God's gift to women. One twenty-buck trick and he's already the biggest stud in New York City. It's laughable.
Shee-it. You believe all you read?
Shee-it, you know, I got this thing all figured out, Ratso. I mean Rico. When we get to Miami, what I'll do, I'll go to work. I gotta do that, 'cause see, I ain't no kind of a hustler. I ain't even any goddam good as a bum. I'm a nothing, that's what I am. So reckon I'd better go to work and get me a goddam job. Okay?
It's so exciting. New York. The mad forward thrust of everything. My sense of time here is completely altered.
Oh, difficult, it's so difficult. You're a nice person, Joe -- I should never have asked you up -- a lovely person. Oh, how I loathe life. I loathe it. Please go. Please.
Money from home, see, there's your strength, you put things in earthy terms any man can understand, son. I warn you I'm gonna use you, I'm gonna run you ragged!
This Pensacola teeny-bopper -- jail bait -- but built? Ten bucks she wanted. Three of us made a deal for, twenty-five, see, big goddam bargain?
... and taxi fare for me.
Getchmis...?
Yeah... Only the room service is lousy.  Come on, let me show you the tennis courts.
...Don't worry about it.  I can punch you in the nose later. Right now we've got to get you out of here.  You all right?
Sixty Lira?
How much did you figure to make?
He sells insurance for Metropolitan Life.
Hashish.  Ninety percent of the foreigners are in for hashish.
Aslan, there... 
Seven years...
Yeah!
Two thirty.
Yeah.
And you ate two baclavas, right? I not to touch them, mine was awful.
What is it? . . . Billy?
Oh shove it, Ziat for all the money you have, you have nothing!
Yeah, and a loudspeaker so you can yell "Epidemic! Epidemic! You're all going to die!"
H-how do I get...?
I think so. One right, two lefts...
What?
Oh, you helped me here, all right, white boy.  You and your goddam memo. You needed to prove your point, uh?
No way we can outrun 'em together. Move it!
Okay. So you lost a great specimen-
Maybe they lied to you.
No, there's...
Right.
I know.  But if it was carrying something...there's a chance you could have been exposed.
Peter-
Try not to sweat?
Jump in.
Your arm, you can't...
I can.  We can do this...
Ah...
Talk to me.
I just...well, I had this cousin in Delhi.  She was having problems, too. She, ah...
I have no idea.  Are you ready?
No shit.
I know.  Help me get a sample.
I'm not much of a critic.
How does a nice cup of cocoa sound?
I didn't know it was going to be a big storm.
Nothing.
Well, it's brilliantly written, but then everything you write is brilliant.
Well, these are slum kids, I was a slum kid, everybody talks like that.
It's fine.
Then the roads are open...
Misery?
I DIDN'T...
If I knew this was gonna be the surprise, you could've gotten me to burn all my books.
Oh, but Paul!  I don't think, I know! Now that you've gotten rid of that nasty manuscript, you can go back to doing what you're great at--  --you're going to write a new novel-- your greatest achievement ever-- Misery's Return.
But mine cost the most so I don't see how it could smudge.
Annie, what's the matter?
You know goddamn well what I've been doing--I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE SUFFERING. I need my pills.
What? What happened to "I'll treasure whatever you do?"
Don't be silly. Of course you can.
Wait, let's do this right. Do you have any candles?
Why would I want to leave? I like it here.
What?
Paul, this will be our legacy.
I was fooling, silly.  You need a cigarette, because you used to smoke but you quit except when you finish a book, and you just have one, and the match is to light it. And you need one glass of champagne.  Dome Pear-igg-non.
Four or five days ago. Why?
Oh, I like that tone.
How many times do I have to tell you-- I have a system here.  Where the hell is that thing?
I'm sure you know Paul's been going to the Silver Creek Lodge for years to finish his books.
You think he might be missing?
So do I...
If I can.
Yeah. They're in the semis.
I thought you'd be thrilled. You're being taken seriously.
I am. Well, maybe not completely--
Hugh, take care of the Nekhorvich memory card.
And my room?
Billy, make sure Nyah's not followed.
And you're happy about that?
You know, that was the hardest part of having to portray you.  Grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes.
Somebody's been slipping you our mail. Come on out here, you bad girl.
She wouldn't  be here if it wasn't for you, Hunt.  from this moment you're responsible for what happens to her, and if you're looking out for her well-being, I suggest you advise her to pick up the gun and bring it to me.  Ball's in your court, Hunt.  What've you got to say? Nyah's waiting for your answer.
In other words, you're calling her a flake.
In any case we don't want your cash.
What manic invents  disease like that in the first place?  Why would he do it?
What can we do' mate?
Oh.  Well.  I think that can be arranged.
- this is very disconerting..
If you weren't going to let me get away with it, why did you let me go thru with it?
Not really.  I triggered the alarm..
This wasn't what I had in mind, Nyah.
Generally, I don't favor coercing someone. Not when there's a chance my life could end up in their hands.
You don't trust me.
Oh, I do.  But as we know I'm a very poor judge of character.
Just like old times.
Just about..
Annex is strictly off limits to me and they never come to the main house, Michael even takes their meals to them all but shoves them under the door.
Oh Ethan!..
What did you think of him?
The question is why?  What was this Chimera Nekhorvich was carrying?
Well you know Nekhorvich's history. You're the one who got him out of the Soviet Union was it still in bio- weapon business.
Go to bed with a man and lie to him? She's a woman.  She's got all the training she needs.
But that leaves another seven or eight pints of Chimera.
You mean that leaves Miss Hall.
No.  I can't afford to be curious.  And neither can you, Hunt..
Why not?  You've done just about everything else on this operation.
Yes, he knew.  Just..
I'm fine..
Ninety-seven minutes, twenty-seven seconds.
You know, I think it's a little late for that.  Do give my regards to Gradski if you see him.
I don't remember what happened!  We were at the bar, drinking, laughing -- having fun.
They'll kill me.
And if we donÃ­t find him - weÃ­ll search the whole train again.
WhatÃ­s Hunt doing on the TGV?
What kind of show.
Why the masquerade?  Why take the risk? Well, Claire, youÃ­ve asked the question and you are the answer.
I want to sleep.  Can I sleep here.
I wasn't.  I heard that Jim was in trouble on the radio.  He said someone was...
Did they send you...Did they send you?
Okay...
Yeah.
Why was there another team?
Ethan, I can understand you're very upset.
It's hard to tell.  I'm gonna have to be close.
I figured I'd let 'em reinstate my back pay, give me a promotion, check out my office at Langley and <i>then</i>, maybe, talk about it.
Why not?  You gave Job a hundred and twenty five thousand.
That depends.
It's quite out of the question.
The disk Job sold you is worthless.  It's bait, part of an internal molehunt.
Why should I?
Tell you what.  How good's the RF scanner you used in the car?
What was your deal with Job?
Bank?
IMF mainframe.
What about my coat?  I'll freeze.
If Max doesn't like what you have to say, you'll be wearing that shroud indefinitely.
I thought I'd take some now.
Not this week. This week he's flyfishing at the Oughterard Slough in County Kildare, with one of our best Irish guides.
He won't be back in a hurry?
No, not in a hurry.  What do you think? You think the plot'll work?
Can you lose him?
Tight security.  No guns.  Real plus.
Is something wrong with the phone?  Well is something wrong with the batteries?
Nobody. Loretta is getting married.
I don't know, Rose. I don't know where I've been, and I don't know where I'm going.  You should have your eyes opened for you, my friend.
I never seen anybody so in love like Cosmo back then! He'd stand outside the house all day and look in the windows. I never told you this cause it's not really a story. But one time I woke up in the middle of the night cause this bright light was in my face. Like a flashlight. I couldn't think a what it was. I looked out the window, and it was the moon! Big as a house! I never seen the moon so big before or since. I was almost scared, like it was gonna crush the house. And I looked down, and standing there in the street was Cosmo, looking up at the windows. This is the funny part. I got mad at you, Cosmo! I thought you brought this big moon over to my house cause you were so in love and woke me up with it. I was half asleep I guess and didn't know no better.
I know you don't. That's the point. I'll say no more.
What's your news?
The guy died.
I didn't give you away the first time.
Maybe.
What are you doing here?
You're my daughter. I won't have you acting like a tramp!
And what did they say?
You are going to marry my brother?
Yes. Do you want...
Seven years ago.
No. Unlucky. I have not been lucky.
All my life I have never reached a man. I knew that I would reach my husband, but I took my time and he was dead. Ronny.
I've got you.
Alright. Alright. There will be nothing left.
What did you do?
What?
Last night never happened, you hear me? I'm gonna marry him anyway and last night never happened, and you and I are gonna take this to our coffins!
But he wants me to come!
Beautiful. Sad. She died!
I'm here!
Let me go home.
Will you marry me?
Yes?
On the floor?
Pop don't like Johnny.
I got married before, you didn't sell.
Just like your father. I lied to him. He thinks you came home last night.
No. Are you drunk?
He's with his dying mother!
A miracle? This is modern times! There ain't supposed to be miracles any more!
I... a... slept with my fiancÃ©'s brother.
He owes her a wedding from the first time when there was none.
That was my father-in-law, who has a wrong idea in his head. Listen, Johnny, there's a question I want to ask you. And I want you to tell me the truth if you can. Why do men chase women?
Well. There's the Bible story. God took a rib from Adam and made Eve. Maybe men chase women to get the rib back. When God took the rib, he left a hole there, place where there used to be something. and the women have that. Maybe a man isn't complete as a man without a woman.
It was a miracle!
I'm not eating alone. Can I ask you a question?
Go ahead.
Why do men chase women?
We could go to my apartment. You could see how the other half lives.
He's a plumber.
You were a tiger last night.
No, no,  It floats.   Throw her in the pond Tie weights on her.  To the pond.
You've got two empty halves of coconuts and you're banging them together.
Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
Please!
And ... the Grail ... The Grail is there?
We don't have a lord.
You don't vote for kings.
Oh!
NI!   NI!
All right!  What do you want?
I move for no man.
A scratch?  Your arm's off.
Come on you pansy!
Come on then.
Had enough?
Had enough ... ?
My liege ... forgive me ...
I do.  You seek the Holy Grail.
You didn't bother to find out, did you?
Be quiet!  I order you to shut up.
Ah! NOW ... we see the violence inherent in the system.
Bloody peasant! 
What is your name?
Stop! Who approacheth the Bridge of Death Must answer me These questions three! Ere the other side he see!
What is your name?
Here's one!
That's all right.  See you on Thursday.
I dunno, Must be a king.
Yes ...  I'm very sorry ...
Herbert ...  We built this castle on a bloody swamp, we need all the land we can get.
No.  Until I come and get him.
Leaving the room ... yes.
Okay.  Fine.  We'll remain here until you get back.
Is that clear?
Mine is Zoot. Just Zoot  But come.
I'm afraid our life must seem very dull and quiet compared to yours.  We are but eightscore young blondes, all between sixteen and nineteen-and-a-half, cut off in this castle, with no one to protect us.  Oooh.  It is a lonely life ... bathing ... dressing ... undressing ... making exciting underwear....
Camelot ...
No, really, I can cope.  I can handle this lot easily!
I knew that someone would come.  I knew ... somewhere out there ... there must be ...
Well, let's not jump to conclusions ...
Stop saying it.  AAAArghh! ... I've said it ...
Well, It's got huge ... very sharp ... it can jump a... look at the bones.
I speak as I find, Archie.
Not down south you don't.
It's only grief makes her like she is.
What?
There's love and there's behaving like you do because there's nobody to tell you not to.
You work the system right, you could ask her yourself.  Just be thankful you're not working for Household.  The Queen never lets them out of her sight.  But wee spats like us can slip through the net, easy.
Aye, but will they?
She'll be worried about me.
Oh, I'm much more than that.
Come on, man, I'm telling you what you already know.
Mary Taylor, sir.
Yeah.
I don't think I've had that pleasure.
I tell you, if we don't stick together on this, you could find yourself First President's Opposition.  Du Royaum Uni.
I said, are you deaf as well as stupid?
The future King!
Out of my way!
Mama...
Yes.  I do.
Do you hunt?
I've been called back to London.  My last day.  I thought I might take a walk on Lochnagar.
Still, someone must attend you.  Your wife should not have let you out.
Ma'am.
Yes.  That will be company for you.
Yes, ma'am.
Those, over there, there.
Who by?
Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are charming.
I hope they didn't go to any trouble, John.
Yes, ma'am.
Yes.  Yes it was.
No, ma'am.
My dear Stanley, a Prime Minister with only a handful of friends must respect public opinion.
Excellent!
We think she can be dissuaded.  Have you had a glance at the diary?
No, indeed.
Yes, ma'am.
Why?
He thought, perhaps, Your Majesty might wish to be informed of the latest developments in government.
We were expecting you to return by six.
I have no idea.
They are demanding the dismissal of John Brown on grounds of drunkeness.
It's a tough game.  Hard to pin that bastard down.  Keeps on changing the rules.
How do you stop The Screamer?
Sure.
Yeah, who isn't.
Level Ten.  That's where you've got to unlock ARCADE's heart using the keys you've found.
Actually, no.  I was just telling Nick, here, that my t.v.'s busted...
Hey, kid.
It's twelve-thirty!
Greg never came home.  A few hours is one thing, Nick, but this is different. Something's happened to him.
I'm in the middle of it...
Turn if off!
It is.
It's two o'clock in the morning.  Go home. Go to sleep.  We'll figure something out in the morning.
Sure.
Then where do we go?!
I was afraid you'd say that.
I can't believe you made it!
No.  If you're smart, you run like hell.
I know.  It sucks.
There never is.
Good.   Cause I'd freak if you weren't.
And then keep on driving?
Of course I am.
Fucked up.  That's what they said I was.
I am giving her a chance.  Why don't you get off my back?
They fired everyone.
Sort of, funny boy. If I tell him the meeting's on you're to go to the top of Beachwood Canyon. There's a corral up there where he'll be.
I understand, Cynthia and thank you for the offer. I'll find a place. Now go ahead and give the Cowboy a yodel and get back to me.
A man's attitude ... a man's attitude goes some ways toward how a man's life will be. Is that somethin' you agree with?
So let's just say I'm drivin' this buggy and you fix your attitude and you can ride along with me.
But it said #12.
If you have a concussion you shouldn't sleep.
What do you mean?
You don't remember anything else?
No  There is something...something there I can't tell... I can't describe it.  There are things there.... but I'm... here.
"I can call them... I can call my dad... "
Hey, let's introduce the brand new you to Hollywood. We haven't seen the roof garden yet.
Well ... it's the second one I've had, but they were both the same......they start out that I'm in here but it's not day or night. It's kinda half night, but it looks just like this except for the light, but I'm scared like I can't tell ya. Of all people you're standing right over there by that counter. You're in both dreams and you're scared. I get even more frightened when I see how afraid you are and then I realize what it is - there's a man...in back of this place. He's the one ... he's the one that's doing it. I can see him through the wall. I can see his face and I hope I never see that face ever outside a dream.
Two men... two guns in the Caddy.
Where at?
Unreal ... so, you're looking good. Whatcha doin' these days?
No ... thanks though... I'll take a cigarette if you have one.
Please don't be alarmed, Ma'am.
I made this place..... now listen to me. I'll get out of this room, we have bigger troubles than this....
No !
Why should I ?
What ?
Then you didn't give him any passwords of any kind ?
I'm not listening.
Obviously, but what's the way out ?
But how do you know if the people are guilty ?
I do a very thorough background check. I go through police files, personel files, anything.
Then how come Matt and I showed up as guilty ?
There are other things too. They had everyone start taking those psych tests. Did they make you take one ?
I wanted to let his family know....
Know what ? That it was your fault ?
Fine...
I don't help criminals.
Because of my charming personality ?
I'd get out of the water if I were you.
Why ?
Ow...
Let's just see if he can make it into round two....
When I think you're ready.
He already had a balance of $600,000.
Any priors ? Any police record ?
I'm sick of playing. I've got a better idea.
We will start work on it now sir.
Not that well sir. I believe we have a few too many soft hearts in the building. Did we aquire a bank from Chicago or a charity ?
While I am not morally against these little, shall we say "hobbies", as long as I am on the payroll, but why not something like a yacht club ?
That's right, sir. He does a thorough background check and if he finds them to be criminal or guilty of embezzlement, then he will put them in the park. He has refused the last three suggested "guests".
Yes, do you think he would like a raise and a new position ?
Good, sir.
There was a bit of confusion on one of my last jobs.
No. I am not a homosexual.
Just a temp who pissed me off and a girl who turned me down for the night of her life.
Shit, I forgot about them. Well, I guess the boss man wasn't as tough as I thought.
What happened ?
Yes.
This is too easy, I mean I had a speech prepared, then I even wore these pants because I could get on my knees to grovel.
Thank you, won't you come in ?
I just want to have something that's mine, you know ? It's like living off of their money is fun and all. There are certain materialistic needs that I have that can only be satisfied with that extra little scratch.
Actually, I'm more interested in the man behind the wheel more than the manufacturer. So what is it that you have that makes you a materialistic fool ?
Wake up, we're in trouble.
What ?
I'm fine.
UCLA? My cardigan sweater period.
You're Vada right?
So, what's on your mind?
Oh yeah, right-between the power mower and the weed killer.
Dad I'm kidding, you can have the room.
What??
Thanks, I needed that.
I'll be back in 137 hours.
Have fun.
I will. How's Shelly?
Can I see him?
Listen, if a boy wants to do homework with you, it really means he didn't have nerve to ask you out on a date, so you'll get your homework together and pretend to be studying, and the next thing you know you're ordering pizza and talking about your favorite movie stars.
How about a nice glass of milk?
Hillary Mitchell? How's she?
That's all right, you know what? You sound just sounded just like your mother...she told great stories. Stories with crazy accents and...special effects.
See you? He can smell you from there.
He likes you.
Well actually I was born in Siberia and then they shot her and sent me home to my Dad.
Hi.
Ehh...I'm staying at the chateau and the guy who runs the garage there said that you're the best Jag people in town...so uhm.
Well Enrique is great and...we are the best.
I'm Sam Helburn. Sam.
Happy hunting.
I never met my mother.
MOM!
No THANKS!
It's the leather bindings, I love the fragrance of vintage books.
What if you don't wanna be found?
You would.
Does it work?
Don't force it, you'll break it.
Oh no?!?!?!
Here's Judy Garland!
That's 'cause I was cursed with the Sultenfuss Bear Claws.  My hands fit.
Maybe this Jeffrey guy is...is my real father. I mean...look at me, I have the hair of a dead person and...and my nose, no one in my family has this nose, it could be the nose of...a...of a complete stranger,
You're a good man Nicholas.
Well, wha...what kind of arrangement?
That's ridiculous, I'm...I'm very, umm, what do you call it?
Yes, it does.
Sounds like you're very organized.
Oh, are you a hairdresser?
I'm a pediatric cardiologist.
Yes, I do.
I bet your mom sang to you.
Is there milk in them already?
No, the milk comes when the baby comes.
Yeah, it would be kinda great.
But Dad'll never go for it.
Leave him alone! Come on, let's go.
How do I know you were gonna show us one?
This guy bonking you?
It's her home! It's where she lives!!
I'm impressed.
That can't be, I have all the classic symptoms.
You'd be doing hair and makeup and answering the phone.
I think she looks nice! Her lips are very thin so I used the gloss to give them a more sensual quality, and her eyes just needed a little definition, and her hair, I'm sorry, nobody wears this hairdo anymore in 1972.
Harry, I really think she.....
Okay, sure.
Are you mad at me?
Kiss me.
Yes.
Good.
I'm looking forward to that.
Look, you're not gonna take Shelly's camper.
You can get the general idea...
Pointing upwards Look...
Yeah, and when those suppers are disrupted because there's a car crash, or there's a fire, or a little boy steps on a beehive.
Dad?
It's for school, for summer writing class.
I love this guy! 
She likes to play bingo.
Ahh, Vada, just put anything you want in the cart, anything at all.  I don't know what's gotten into her today.
Soon honey, soon.
In a minute, look it's hot, sweetie you'll burn your nose, look out.
I told him not to tease those bees. Did he get stung?
Ahh, that little Chevy was your mothers favorite car.
Oh, you're dressing, uh huh, Harry Harry Harry Harry, don't you know it's not nice to lie to your big brother?
Hi, is Vada home?
Really? Already? The summer's just begun.
It's summer! You're kids! Go play!
Please.
Cause she gets scared of all those dead people in her house, and you know that saying, If you can't beat 'em, join 'em, well if she's one of them, she won't be as scared.
Can we look around in your camper?
Sure. I'll give you the royal tour.
Thomas?
No.
Hi.
Nephritis? It's a kidney disease, you don't get it from hot dogs.
Oh great!!
Yes!!
I'm hemorrhaging.
I'm eleven and a half.
I'm allergic to it.
To chocolate?
I can't, I have to go home.
Big deal, I can do that too.  Thomas J, you got something!
If I do it, can we go?
Uh huh.
That was Grammoo's. It's a phrenology chart, they used to study the bumps in your head to see if you had a good personality or not. Come here, i'll diagnose your head.
You have no personality.
Let's go to the church, they're playing bingo tonight.
For their meat.
My mood ring! It fell off! I gotta find it!
You're such a retard, it was an engagement ring.
I have to anyway, my mom will be worried.
Okay, seeya.
I'm gonna marry Mr. Bixler.
No.
Maybe we should, just to see what's the big deal.
Okay.
You should look like you dressed yourself.
Plus some guys whose food I don't like.
Is Newsday a real interview, or just some cute guy you're setting me up w...
If I didn't have to hate her, I'd adore her.
I'm taking my next book to Viking.
Hey, handsome.  Brevity this...
... garden sports, all.  Little swing of maybe fifty degrees Fahrenheit, represents a packing challenge, but there's fine food and cocktails at a choice of Embassy Suit...
But he sure can kiss.
Hello.
I love him.
You are <u<so right.  What a nerve on that guy!  Bring my dress to church, huh?
Nice meeting you, too, Walt.
Sir, this is important! Haven't you ever in your life cut one corner, to make something important turn out right?
I told him, get the important stuff, Kim's ring.  I'll collect the inconsequentials.
Well, somet...
W...
Mirrors.
Quite the little eccentric.
... all of it.  She's leaving her family, her friends, everything she knows.  She's putting her career on hold, and she seems a pretty ambitious, driven, kind of pers...
She would never.  Never.  Even think of that.
Have you.
It's more than that.
Except for the hot affairs we'll have twice a year.
I mean, you commit to a wedding. And then it seems like... this... momentum, you know?  You forget you... chose it.
We danced to it.  Just like this.
Yeah, Kim told me they were giving you their Dueling Scarlet's act.  Actually, they're sophomores at Juilliard.
ISN'T THERE A GUARD?  A JANITOR? A FUCKING CLEANING WOMAN? I'LL TAKE A BURGLAR!  SOMEBODY'S GOTTA BE IN TH...
It means a lot.
It's over.
A bad combination.
No, it's for the best, it really is.  We were so wrong for each other.
And your point?
Well, it happens.
... yeah, that.
Lower.
That is so romantic.
I'm just thinking of how she's hurting.  Lost.  Alone.  Like her life is over.
... me, yeah.  And she likes Tommy Lasorda.  Case closed.
... and you knew about this.
MICHAEL!!
... Mr. Julianne Potter, prominent New York drag queen.
Well, it better not happen again.
Feed, mostly. Thought we'd get something for the kids.
Well, I just wondered 'cause being from out or town I wouldn't be able to make anything.
I see.
Honey, it's okay... How do you feel now?
All those people...
Thank you-- Yes, I am.
You bet.
Your job, huh.
Minimum.
Sure thing. Put them here... I'll take them.
Harvard?
You go out in the woods and shoot targets -- Whoever shoots the most wins a live turkey
She sure sings nice.
Ah, hello. My name is Kenneth Fraser... And I'm here from Terre Haute, Indiana. Ah, listen ... somebody stole my handles.
I've been so worried, dear. where are you?
Well, I got to Nashville. That's pretty far.
I feel really good.
No. No, they're white. He's got a nice dog.
Your hair fell out? Just like your father. Weak hair.
I want to get the dog off my bed.
Keep warm, dear. Let me hear from you.
Isn't it unusual for you to be working with a black choir?
Well, can you tell me why?
About three years.
No, mostly his wife's. She's in Paris, France, right now. My husband Delbert is real friendly with him. Delbert's in law. Does work for him.
Do you like him?
Remember, about a month ago, your church choir cut a record?
Well, I met you that afternoon in the control room and we...
I've got a gig tonight.
Older.
Fifteen minutes?
They said go see the chaplain.
You sound different. Is that really you?
You're real favorites of his.
Out.
Yeah, you bet. You're really terrific. You know what I mean?
Oh yes, I'm John Triplette.
What?
Where is she?
No, we never did that
You do?
He ain't really new.
Southern California.
Spent time in Arizona. Why?
It's not bad.
You serious?
Sure thing.
Yes you are.
The style of fighting that Tim studied didn't believe in belts.
Yes, I did. That's why Tim studied it. Because it was Bruce Lee's fighting style.
Yes, they were.
Dewight McClusky of the California Prison Board. Take a seat please.
By all means.
How's it goin'?
She was born without a tongue.
Tough titty, it's mine now.
Not good.
Did you ever do one on Wayne Gacy?
Whose ratings were higher?
We've been waiting to do a follow up episode on you for a long time. And that time has definitely come.  I feel it's apparent to anyone who's hip to what's going on that the prison board has thrown the constitution straight out the fuckin' window. You and Mallory may be killers, but you're not insane. You belong in a prison, not in an asylum. The prison board is blatantly railroading you into a hospital for the sole purpose of turning you into vegetables. Now some people are saying, 'So what?' I am not one of those people. If we avert our eyes while they do this to you, we give them permission to do it again whenever they see fit. Today they wipe clean your mind because they feel your actions are dangerous, tomorrow they wipe clean my mind because they feel what I say is dangerous. Where does it all stop?
I'm keen with anticipation.
All right, Mickey.
Out front.
We are.  Your camera.
NO!!!
Fine. Roger, what the hell are you doing? You're bothering the serial killer.
Wayne Gayle!
Waitin' in the lounge.
But you'll never be whole again.
Everything's coming along just fine. Phil, I wanted to know if I could have a small word with you.
They got a asshole over here.  A asshole sitting down reading a magazine over there.  A asshole perched up there.  Assholes everywhere. Hey, maybe if we were doin' that kiss, kiss, bang, bang stuff we'd need all those assholes, too. What we're about is intimacy. We're about two people having a conversation. Say I was interviewing you. All I want you to worry about is what I ask you. I want a trust to develop. If you're thinking about all this...  ...you're not going to relax, a trust won't develop, we'll be talking a each other instead of to each other, there will be no chance for intimacy.
Lose 'em.
Phil, I'm just scared he's gonna clam up on me with all these sheriffs all over the place. They hate him. He hates them. What kinda intimacy am I gonna create with all this hate in the air. Even you and I feel it.
Two guys?
Stay up here and finish your interview, I've got to see what the hell's going on down there before I can take responsibility for you to film there.
Everybody givin' it away free, huh?
No, boy. Thirty-eight cents worth of gas. And watch you don't make it thirty-nine.
That dyin's gonna be done two ways.
Okay.
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
You a union man?
Well, what d'you know?!
Then do like I said.  Men - this boy here's got something to tell you-all.  Well, how about it?
Don't say much, do you?
Well, he worked around.
Cup of coffee.  I 'been meanin' to talk to you.
You working?
You work around town?
Oh yeah? That's my home town.
So what you doin' with a cat like me in a joint like this?
Well, that's a funny thing to say.
What is it?
Hell, baby, I bet you think we got tails.
I see. That beer made me dizzy.
It's hard to see any change. But I'm going to stay. Another year, anyway.
You almost got into trouble back there.
You have some very primitive ideas, don't you?
All right, so I'm primitive. So what d'you want with me?
Why did you?
What's he like?
Your boy.
Don't call them that.
Well, if you don't know I can't tell you.
Huh?
You jivin' me?
Yeah. Yeah, I know. I'm not really thinkin' about it. Anyway, don't want those white guys laughin' up their sleeve at me when they see me pull out.
You'll be better off without me. I ain't fit to live with no more. It's just like a lynchin'. Maybe they don't use a knife on you, but they got other ways.
Duff--
You gonna sit at home the rest of your life? Jesus!
Well, it's better than windin' up like a bum.
Wouldn't have known you.
I heard you.
Sorry.
I said, she's in great shape.
Well, you've got to go easy. We haven't had any trouble in town for eight years, and we're not going to have any now.
I'll be seeing you.
What d'you know about women, Pop?
I know.
Right here.
Don't give her the satisfaction.  Your wife is on her way...
Pity. Then you'll both have to die.
The Elders, mon...
Who's running the show, Armitage? This a government sting?
I don't call this fun, pal. You're playing God with my body.
You son of a bitch...
It hasn't yet.
Sorry, bullshit. We haven't even begun and you're already jeopardising this operation.
Did you trace it?
Stick with her. I want the process to become second nature to you. We fly for Freeside at dawn.
We won't have to. The run is tomorrow night.
Fine, Ratz. Thanks.
No girl? Only biz, my dear artiste?
Always...By the way, you know that girlfriend you don't have?
Jesus Christ, Kid. Nobody's ever cracked Sukura.
Founders of Zion. Builders of Freeside.
All things possible in Babylon.
What?
I'm workin' on it, Bro. I'm workin' on it.
How long, Dixie?
What?
And Linda...
I'll give it my best shot, mother fucker.
Because you've exceeded your shelf life, Case. Word on the street is you're a dead man walking. Nice time for an employment opportunity. Travel to exotic locales.
You want to hear the pitch, you gotta meet the man.
Sorry. That's not gonna happen.
Since Armitage sold them a program on it. Put them years ahead of the competition.
What about before that?
Won't that mean you're dead?
Okay fine. Let's get this over with.
Who?
Oh I know.
Thanks.
How would you like to join The Denominators? The Math Team could really use a new brain. We lost our best logarithm guy last year.
That's the old drive-in. They call it "The Court". Now it's just a continuous party for Guy's group.
I thought this was a 45-minute seminar.
Okay. That's bad.

Umm- I don't think you're supposed to wear white jeans after 1983.
Betty.
So. You and Roger in Op/Ed.
A flack jacket.
Geller, you don't want a reporter's life. They're very--messy. You're all about order. Control. And getting me my copy by five.
Geller, this is way out of your league.
Have you been to any parties?
You know what?  Why don't you just pick me up here? We could all share a limo.
Maybe because we're not supposed to be having sex with bananas.
Okaaaay....  That car's going to bankrupt you.
She just needs a new windshield wiper.
I know this woman. She works in admissions at Lakeshore Community? She might be able to get you in for the Fall semester. Maybe she could get you the baseball scholarship, and I could help and--
This--this is a luau that sells packing material!
Oh yay! And then I could be as happy as you!
I'll give you my Buick Le Sabre.
It was a long time ago -
No. They're at the Franklin Hint Expo at the Skokie Holiday Inn.
She's sixteen years old, Rob. That's totally and completely illegal.
But I think she wanted to be happy, that's why she wrote. I mean, she was still writing about love, right?
Oh I don't think so.
God, I would love to think I'm an interesting teacher. I mean, I had maybe one or two teachers in high school who had any passion at all.
You set me up. For a story.  You know what's crazy? I was actually considering waiting for you.
Now I don't want to! I bought all of your penguin crap. I thought I found her--the right one! And the problem was she was too young! No - the problem was--she didn't even exist!
What?
Why?
I don't know.
Nah uh.
No, I know. But, what if you don't make it? 'I mean, you don t Want to be working at a mail place the rest of your life. It's okay for an after school job, but, come on, "hi, I'm Rob and I run the Tiki Post"?! Totally lame.
<i>                      Three of a kind...</i>
I know.
Of course you do, and I want you to... but there's no need to hurry it along, is there?
That's twice this month you've slipped Deadly Night Shade into my tea and run off.  People might get the wrong idea and think you're unhappy at home.
Jesse's dead, Lisa.  Freddy's here.
He can't hold you Jesse.  He's losing his grip - you can get out.
Naw. Just killing time.
You gotta let me stay here tonight, Grady.
I'm scared, Grady.  I know it sounds crazy.  But, there's something trying to get into my body.
Let me look at your eye...
Traumas of a ten-year old.
Yeah, I know...synapses neurong...
Remember in the diary - Nancy said that she kept finding herself in a boiler room?  Fred Krueger worked here.  It's an old power- plant - a steam generator!
There's nothing to figure out.
Eggs?
Yor dad picking the music again?
Look, Miss Thompson, I don't know what you want from me.
I'll need to take her things.
I'll get it.  Please, I don't mind.
I had such an awful dream.
I gotta stay up, Max.
Yes.  I'm going to see her tonight.
I was on the team at school.  I was never very good, though.
That was different.
He's heavy in the halls...
Let's try this way.
Pulled night duty.  Trimble's sick.
A little basic, but nice.
I'll have a file cabinet in there before tomorrow.  The patient's rooms are down here.
It beats Dr. Simm's theory.  She thinks it's nothing but sex, drugs, and rock & roll.
Right.  They seem to share a group delusion,  a "boogeyman" for lack of a better word.  They're so traumatized, they'll do anything not to sleep.
So I've been told.  Practically an obsession of your.
Didn't get much sleep.
With Hypnocyl?
Do you think we can get the Hypnocyl in by tomorrow?
Then maybe you're ready.
Try me.
There's nothing we can do.  It's out of our hands.
They burned him to death in his boiler room, but they were smart enough to hide the remains.
Freddy Krueger.  He was a child murderer before he died.  After he died, he became ...something worse.  Six years ago Freddy killed my friends. He almost killed me.  I thought I got rid of him -- but I guess he was too strong.
What about Kristen?
You do volunteer work at the hospital?
Only one thing can save the children. The unquiet spirit must be laid to rest.  It is an abomination to God and Man.
My God.
That girl was Amanda Krueger.  Her child --
Freddy.
Accident my ass.  I thought this was supposed to be straight talk in here.
Doesn't count.  You gotta say the words.
Hi.  Good Lord -- you're the spitting image of...
Oh right.
Bye.
No, I've never played anything cool in my entire life.  Spike, who I'll stab to death later, never gave me the message.
Obviously.  Very difficult.
Thank you.  You are 'Horse and Hound's' favorite actress.  You and Black Beauty.  Tied.
Well, I've been on a diet since I was nineteen, which means basically I've been hungry for a decade.  I've had a sequence of not nice boyfriends -- one of whom hit me: and every time my heart gets broken it gets splashed across the newspapers as entertainment. Meantime, it cost millions to get me looking like this...
You know, I'm not sure.  I don't think they'd tried for kids before, as fate would have it.
I thought you were leaving.
You said 'whoopsidaisies.'
Exactly.  Here we go again.
Step aside.
Why?
I don't know.  It got to the point where I couldn't remember any of the reasons I loved him.  And you... and love?
Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer.
Would you like me to take you through your lines?
Would you?  It's all talk, talk, talk.
'Thank you.'  How many mistake did I make?
Cartwright.
Well, get a message through to him too.
I could have a stunt bottom, yes.
More than that actually, when you think about it.  You know, Meatloaf has a very nice pair...
Actually, I can't think really -- let me just have a quick look...
I don't know what happened.
Who knows, it may even help business. Buy a boring book about Egypt from the guy who screwed Anna Scott.
I don't want a goddamn cup of tea.  I want to go home.
I only found out you were here yesterday.
Yes -- I'm sorry -- I had to leave... I didn't want to disturb you.
No, don't open it yet -- I'll be embarrassed.
... Yes, that's fine.  Of course.  I... you know... of course... I'll just... be getting along then... nice to see you.
Nice surprise.
I haven't decided.
Rufus.
Does the girl have a name?
He wouldn't say.
Don't even ask.
Why not -- all that awaits me at home is a masturbating Welshman.
Well, obviously it's me, isn't it -- I work in the City in a job I don't understand and everyone keeps getting promoted above me.  I haven't had a girlfriends since... puberty and, well, the long and short of it is, nobody fancies me, and if these cheeks get any chubbier, they never will.
And we intend to use them!
I did.
No, well... he was quite a long way away.
Yes.  No, wait -- let's go crazy -- I'll have an orange juice.
That's not fair.
But I wish to make it clear I've turned a corner and henceforward intend to be impressively happy.
I'm sorry, we don't have anyone of that name here, sir.
Right.  Right.  Fair enough.  Thanks.
What are the choices?
Wouldn't want that...  Okay -- just one more.
Good luck.
Right.  Vicious circle.  And then I was like rooting around in your things, and found this, and I thought -- cool. Kind of spacey.
You want me to write down all your messages?
Absolutely not.
Which was?
I think she said her name was 'Flintstone.'
Sort of.
Hello.  I wonder if I could have a little word.
And you get on very well.
Yes.
Right.  Right.  You think it's the wrong moment.  Fair enough.  Do you mind if I have a go?
Right.
Billy, were you afraid of her, or of her love?
Mister Washington.
Yes, Mister McMurphy?
No, that's okay, ma'am. Down it goes.
The hell with the schedule, you can get back to the schedule next week when the series is over. What I want is a vote on it right now!
What the hell does that have to do with it? This is an important event and I want a vote on it!
So do I!
Thank you, ma'am.
Mister Washington, why don't we get a good head start on the day by shaving Mister Bromden and see if we can't avoid a disturbance.
Yes, Miss Ratched...
H-H-Harding, the m-m-man w-wants to t-talk to you, y-you're the pr-pr pr...
Y-y-yes, a b-b-bus!
Soo, fare-the-weel, darlin'. I'm gone on my way, My wagons are loaded, My whip's in my hand...
Yeah, Mack, what is it?
Tell 'er to go straight to hell!
So long, Freddy. Don't take any wooden nickles.
What for?
Now, what would I be trying to say?
A baseball game isn't worth the risk, my friend.
Okay, Harding, you're on.
I'm not talkin' to him! I'm talkin' to myself! It helps me think!
Well, it doesn't hurt him either!  Does it, Chief!  See, it doesn't hurt him.  Jump! An' put it in!
What for?
I refuse!
I just started!
Sure, Mack...
Well, if you gentlemen will excuse me, I have some pressing matters to attend to.
A nickel.
What is it?
Ah, it seems you have no other psychiatric history, Mister Murphy?
Just fine, Doc... In fact, I think I might've put on a couple of pounds since I got here.
Jesus, that old nurse sure wants my ass in a sling, don't she!
'Kay, let's see...  Cheswick first ... then Billy... Martini... Scanlon... Sefelt... Fredrickson... Taber an' the Chief... 'Kay
Breakfast! Hell, I know just the place where we can chow down an' thaw out before we shoot back on home. 'Kay?
'Kay...
How's your ass been holdin' up, honey?
Hit, you say? Well well well and with a king up, the boy wants a hit. Whadaya know. So comin' at you and too bad, a little lady for the lad and he's over the wall and down the road, up the hill and dropped his load.
This way, Mister McMurphy.
Ya know, I ain't never been in an institution of psychology before.
Asshole.
Shit, man, tha' ain't even worth considerin'.
Take you han's offa me!
No way...
Yes, ma'am...
Is he in an asylum?
Your mother.
It was late in arriving.  But it's here now.
What's she doing?
Really.  She thinks he's here. Even though she's never met him. Even though she's never laid eyes on him.
Is he some kind of celebrity or something?
Yes.  We did.
Exactly.
Ha un numero di telefono?
Don't be stupid, Larry.  If he's my destiny, then, obviously, he has to be alive.
But, Faith--
Hm.
If it's any of your business, yes.
Yes.
So?!  Is there something wrong with loving somebody who's safe?
He's a podiatrist.  Pain is your body's way of telling you something is wrong.  Your toe is trying to tell you not to do it.
Who says I don't love him?...
He likes to read...  Did he mention anyone in particular?
Mickey Spillane.
Just to that place down at the bottom of the stairs.  Nothing fancy.
Thank you, Peter.  Thank you so much.
What are you doing here?
I don't know if that's such a--
Well.  Congratulations.
Who cares?!  You hired an actor??
Gee, I'm flattered.  What an incredibly romantic gesture. Cancel the roses, I've decided to lie to her instead.
No, it isn't.  I called off my wedding all because of you.
Yes.
Oh, Faith.  My name's Faith.
Brunello di Montalcino, '85, please.
Really...
Yes.  You know all the shrinks on Donahue say that all those love songs about some enchanted evening are just a cruel hoax that feeds people's fantasies.
Yeah, well, Larry and his friends are hungry.  And I did say I'd try to pick something up.
I think it was sweet of him to pick it out.
Oh, I don't know.  I guess it's just not quite the way I always thought it was going to be.  You know, like in the movies.
That's the problem.  When you're a kid you think life is gonna be like the movies.  Dreams come true, the good guys win, people live happily ever after... all that crap.  Turn.
But it's July.
Live happily ever after.
Well, we're here.  And more importantly, he's here.  We'll cut back on everything else.
Faith, I've seen it already, okay? If I spot somebody who's got a head that's an eighth of an inch around, standing underneath a tuba, I'll recognize him from the photo. Otherwise, I'm telling you, it's not gonna do me any good.
So, maybe his room hasn't been cleaned yet.  Maybe there's something in there that might help us.  Maybe they'll let us go in and take a look around.
I told you.  If he sees me here with another guy, he's gonna think I'm here with another guy.  I just don't want to send any confusing signals.
He's sitting in the fourth booth down, on the left hand side, with his back to us.  He's wearing a navy jacket.  If you turn around, you can see part of his right elbow.
Right.  Okay...  It's meant to be right?  This is it.
A little bad luck?
You sure you'll be okay?
I'm sure.  And Kate, thank you for coming.  Thank you for being such a good friend.
I'll be back before you leave.
My God... you're right.
And he is living proof.
I thought this was supposed to be the one guy in the world you wouldn't need to change.
Or maybe it'll turn him back into a toad.
You are looking for a place to stay, no, Kate?
I thank you.
Well, there's nothing here to eat.
No.
It's not exploitation.  These people wanna sell and I wanna buy. How are golf clubs exploitation?  She takes one night class and suddenly she's a socialist.
Don't call me doll, Larry.  I hate it when you call me doll.
You used to love it when I called you doll.
It was just a joke.  I was pushing the arrow.  I wanted to get to the next question.  I wanted to find out who was gonna win the Series.
Good strategy.
Mania.
Aren't you gonna go introduce yourself?
Sorry...
I'm gonna take her home first.
And what in blazes have the nuns got to do with it?
When I was a mere spit of a lad on Ferry Street in Dublin the nuns used to say to me, "Nolan, don't be swallowin' ye words like fishballs. When you got something to sayâ€  â€”Talk with your mouth wide open," so if I'm loud don't blame meâ€ it's the fault of the nuns!
The Joey Doyle thing. You know how he is. Things like thatâ€ he exaggerates them. Too much Marquis of Queensbury.  It softens 'em up.
I know what's eatin' you, kid. But I got two thousand dues-payin' members in my localâ€ that's seventy-two thousand a year legitimate and when each one of 'em puts in a couple of bucks a day to make sure they work steadyâ€ well, you figure it out. And that's just for openers. We got the fattest piers in the fattest harbor in the world. Everything that moves in and outâ€ we take our cut.
So they're walking along and smiling. That doesn't mean he's going to talk. There's no evidence until he gives public testimony.
I ain't interested in his mental condition. All I want to know is, is he D 'n D or is he a canary?
What do you want me to do, Johnny?
Mmâ€”hmmm.
I always figured I'd live longer without it.
You don't mean you're thinking of testifying againstâ€ 
â€”ex-tanker who's walking on his heelsâ€ ?
Make up your mind, kid, I beg you, before we get to four thirty-seven River... .
I always had a bet down for you. You saw some money.
How could anyone do this to Joey. The best in the neighborhood... . everybody said it, not only me. Who'd want to harm Joey? Tell meâ€ who?  -- who?
You hear that, Terry?  Terry, did you hear that?  You lost the battle but you have a chance to win the war. All you gotta do is walk.
I better see you get there.
I better get home.
It isn't brains. It's how you use them.
I can get home all right from hereâ€
I only live up there and across the roof.
He had a few birds.  I got up and fed 'em this morning.
Want to go out and have one with me?
Hit me again, Mac.
A dive? You mean, into the water?
Naw, in the ring, a dive is-
Terry!
You've been off in daisyland, honey. Everybody's got a racket.
If you don't  Keep your neck in and your nose clean and You'll never have no trouble down here.
All right, all right.. I shouldn't 've asked you.
You haven't finished your beer.
I thought I felt mean tonight. But I'm notâ€ I'm justâ€ all mixed up... .
Why should I come hollering to you at all?
I'm tryin' to keep you from being hurtâ€ What more do you want?
Terry, what's wrong?
Yeah, yeah, it's up to me, it's up to meâ€ he says it's up to me.
It's you who's being hurt. By keeping it inside you, like a poison. Sooner or later it's got to come out.
I never mentioned the word before. In his agony he grips a glass standing on the night table.
Edie, I need you to love me. Tell me you love me.
I don't want to see you killed. I want to live with you. Live with you. Any place it's safe to walk the streets without... .
I thought you might want some hot coffee.
Edie, for years we pushed quarters into a cookie jar, to keep you up there with the Sisters, and to keep you from things like I just seen out the window. My own daughter arm-in-arm with Terry Malloy. You know who Terry Malloy is?
He tries to act tough, but there's a look in his eyes that... .
Pop!
It's like carrying a monkey around on your back.
Mind your own business, Father.
You go to hell.
D 'n D?
Are you on the level, Father?
So help me God!
Yeah?
Really?
... .and you'll tell Johnny Friendly.
You'd be off the pier for good.
A cheese-eater!  You're kidding!
You was our first Supreme Commander, Terry. Keep out of sight and I'll tell him you're out.
Easy. Easy, boy.
First things first.
Easy, that new checker faked the receipt. Here it is, boss. 
Forty-five bills.
Hey, Terry, front and center.
By way of Chicago?
Nothing happened, Johnny.
You mean Kayo Nolan, the old timer? He doesn't know much.
I said beat it! At the right time I'll catch up with you. Be thinkin' about it.
I was only talkin' to her.
A dime, Terry, a dime for a cup of coffee?
I can't believe itâ€ a small fortune.   You can't buy meâ€ you're still a bum!  'Bye, Edie. Lord have mercy on Joey. 
Look who says bum!
When we knock off let's have a bit of a party. We'll drink to God and Ireland, its whiskey and its women, to Joey and Edieâ€  and death to tyrants everywhere... .!
Patrick, me lad, I'm ahead of you.
Fiend is it!  You will not be so fortunate.  Your existence will cease within moments.  No one wishes to see a man dance...  And you, my dear, will entertain for centuries to come.
I do not joke in my proposal.
Sure there are--and I've tried them all.  Plays, love stories, westerns, dog stories.  Huh, now there was a good one, that dog story all about--
What can we do?
Be careful!
My guess is if we don't take the chance pretty soon, we're not going to have much life left anyway.
I'm frightened.  I'm so frightened.
You're talking nonsense.
That sudden?
Yes, that sudden.  If it weren't for you we wouldn't be hunting for an old cemetery on a night like this.  It's all your fault.
...And I thought you loved me.
Tie them that they may watch.
Oh, yes, a religion of sorts.
At the first sight of the morning sun's rays, we must be gone.
It would seem so, Master
Then see that it does not happen again, in the penalty of Everlasting Despair.  Now are there others?
Hahh, there is always time... All in good time...there is <b>always</b> time.  You shall have your pleasure.  <b>THAT</b>... I <i>decree</i>
For what!?!
You know better than that.
You are the keepers of the Damned.  You two know them all. And I am tired of this usual type of entertainment. I want...a decided change.
Yes, sir, Master.
I repulse you?  Very well.  It seems you have chosen your own fate. Live with it!  I should say <b>die</b> with it!
Aannnnaahhnn.
I said not as a rule.
Emil the Amazing.  The bastard fired me and hired another girl, a redhead. I'm working on a new business card, pass out to the cafes.  How's this sound--
Well, seeing as you have so much luck with cars, Buddy thought it might be better to bring two.  He got this guy he says you know from Lompoc, Glenn something.
Yes.
I know a Glenn.
I don't know.  He was different after he was sentenced, looking at thirty years.  Said it depressed him every time the younger cons called him an old timer.
Oh.  Uh-huh.
Listen to me.  I'm a good friend of Jack Foley.
She's coming with us.
I know exactly what you mean.  It's just a feeling.  You know, I could go for some wine tonight.
There's a store around the corner, I'll be right back.
We'll leave first thing in the morning.
In here with my suntan lotion and beach towel.  That's her place.
Sure looks that way.
Now you're talkin'.
I think Glenn opened his big mouth and now we got us another partner.
Or two.
They don't stay the night, Jack, 'less you pay for it.
Let's drive by where we're meeting and have a look.  Maybe take a look at Ripley's place while we're at it.
Did you give her a jump?  If you did I might begin to understand where your head's at.
I get that feeling, yeah.
I don't ski.
Yeah, hi.  Nice house.
All you gotta do is get in.
I'll go with you.
Jack --
Isn't that my report you're holding onto?
Really?  Huh.  He told me he didn't remember how many he robbed.
Yeah, but I had enough reason to believe he did, and I told you.  So you had to at least suspect him.
The time came, you shot him.  But you didn't shoot Foley or the guy with him.  They're unarmed, you had a shotgun and you let them throw you in the trunk. Okay, now you got your Sig in your hand.  You say in the report you couldn't turn around, he had you pinned down.  But when the trunk opened, how come you didn't cap the two guys then?
You say in the report Glenn didn't have a gun, but you let him get away, too.
Karen.  Where are you?  I been trying to get a hold of you.
Where are you?  I been trying to reach you.
I'm at Adele Delisi's.
What-- we already talked to her.  That's a dead end.
Oh.  Then this must be Adele...
Excuse me, Adele?
You were out running this morning, sticking to your routine, anybody happened to notice.  But you only did a couple of miles instead of your usual five.  Saving yourself for the main event.  Then I see you inside eating ten pounds of macaroni. Carbohydrates for endurance.
Christ, I know Snoopy Miller.  He's a fuckin' wackjob thinks he's Sugar Ray Leonard.  Hangs out with a couple other Grade-A nutcases over on the West side.
I'll need a last known address.
That's right.
Let's go outside and talk.
For your breath.  You could use it. Squirt some in your mouth.
That's funny.
I know the difference.  You were in Lompoc USP, the federal penitentiary. I've delivered people there.  So basically you've spent half your life in prison.
We still talk, though.
I don't recall his hat, but I've seen pictures of him lying dead, shot by Texas Rangers.  Did you know he didn't have his shoes on?
<i>Network</i>.  Yeah, she was good.
And the guy saying he wasn't gonna take any more shit from anybody...
Yeah, right.  Anyway, that scene where Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway get shot?  I remember thinking at the time it wouldn't be a bad way to go, if you have to.
Nothing.
With Robert Redford, when he was young.
That's my dad.
How do we do that?
Because you're having too much fun.
So do you.
Yeah, but in a nice way.
Where?
To warn her about Chino.
I told you, I'm not going back.
You guys-- come on-- this is too heavy!
You think he's lying?
Use your head.  The guys got five million lying around his house, you really think he's gonna tell some motormouth he just met in prison about it?
Oh, nuthin'.
I'd like you to go wait in the car. How's that?  Take her with you and put her in back.
In the trunk?
First of all, if he kills you, he's not gonna get any more money out of you.
Yeah, but who's gonna believe Glenn? I mean, do <u>you</u> believe Glenn?
What kinda man lets a woman answer the door, this time a night?
The brothers in Leavenworth gave me the name.
You must be some kinda walker, Henry.
Cheaper I guess, take us both down in one van.
Yeah, could be.  Or maybe she thought we'd have a lot to talk about.
Glenn?
Foley's not going to make it.  And if he goes down, Glenn, you go with him.
Nothing.  I just wanna get the fuck outta here.
Why's that?
Really?
Uh-huh.
It's Richard Ripley.
Right now, son.
Why'd he have to do that to that girl?
Yeah, Kenneth, why you have to do that to that poor girl.
Why would I do that?
I <i>was</i>...
You know your divisions.  You like the fights?  Like the rough stuff?  Yeah, I bet you do.  Like to get down and tussle a little bit?  Like me and Tuffy, before she got run over, we use to get down on the floor and tussle.  I say to her, "You a good dog, Tuffy, here's a treat for you."  And I give Tuffy what every dog love best.  You know what that is? A bone.  I can give you a bone, too, girl.
You find him, tell him the dog got run over and I'm out of grocery money.
Well, <i>he</i> ain't even here that much.  I like to know where he goes, but at the same time I don't <i>want</i> to know, you understand?
Got run over by a car.
Where do you think I might find Maurice?
Which one is that?  The ATF guy?
Technically.  They're separated.
"Hey, yourself."
Maybe.  But you're also curious about the man.  Twice last night you asked your married boyfriend Nicolet about him.  You were concerned, but you didn't want to show it.
You like the wild ones, don't you? Tillman, Nicolet and now Foley.  You know, I've always said there's a thin line between the cowboy cops and the armed robbers, all those guys that love to pack.
I couldn't swear to it, but I'm pretty sure he did.
The combination is three-ten-forty-four.
Yeah.  Sure.  It's all settled.
Where you been hiding, Dick?
Forget about her.  Tell me where the money's at.
No, numbnuts, die.  You get your nurse alone, you look her in the eye, and say, "Baby, they're training me for war, and I don't know what'll happen.  But if I die tomorrow, I wanna know that we lived all we could tonight."  I've never known it to fail.
If Evelyn's here, the rest are here!
Not anxious to die, Sir, anxious to matter.
That was a nice little stunt you pulled, buzzing the base.
Sir?
You'll love it.  No base, no bars, just lots of sun and aircraft maintenance.
A m-missionary?
Well, you p-puked on his feet.
Of the four left, only one is full of fuel.
Land of the free...
I'm sorry, Danny, but they're only accepting the best pilots.
Some other time.  I don't feel like a party.
You left her.  How's that for a fact?
What's there?
Bet they don't dust crops in Japan.
What's between you and her is between you and her.  But here's what's between you and me.  Everybody has a hero, Danny. And you're mine.
They'll turn the ship into the wind before we launch.  That'll help.
I know.
Respect.
We're all going away.
Of course I forgive you.  I know what you feel for Danny is real.  And your choice is your choice.
It was.  I couldn't have you go away, wherever it is...to war...without knowing something.  You think I made a choice, of Danny over you.  I didn't.  I didn't have a choice.  I'm pregnant.
We must go ahead.  This is our moment.
God help them.
I'm not telling.
It's her 18th birthday, I want to show her off.
I'd take better care of my teeth.
The last one was six hundred years ago. It's about time for another one.
It looks great. Don't change the subject. You know how busy Saturdays are. And I can't do the icing. I always mess up the roses. You're not being very responsible.
I don't know. Reunions do funny things to people.
So he started having affairs, and you got depressed.
Wouldn't we all.
Yeah. You're so lucky. He really loves you, too. He's always telling Walter how wonderful you are.
Welcome to the singles' scene.
You better watch out for her. She's after Charlie.
I mailed it to you on Wednesday.
Not that I'm glad you were sick, but I had a chance to do some thinking last night.
Who?
Charlie. About last nights..
Why?
Look, I've got the hair, got the eyes, got the teeth, I got the car. I'm the lead singer, I'm the man.
I just can't trust you anymore.
It means I care about you and what happens to you.
Of course.
I'm trying.
God, Peggy, you're so unformed you're practically fetal. You're just taking pity on him 'cause he has no friends.
I beg your pardon?
Have a nice day.
But I'm remembering the future.
Maybe you're confusing his life with his work.
The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club.
They care about you. They're just a different generation.
I shouldn't have put you through that. It must have been agony. Let's do something.
Rita. I met her last summer. She's cool. You'll really dig her. She's got this great little cabin in the hills, just outside of Provo where she raises chickens. I'll write and the two of you can take care of the chickens to support us.
Peggy Sue's still stuck on treble without a cause.
Just a little. I've had a tough day.
Peggy, let me ask you something.  You're not... expecting are you?
At my age? Don't be silly.
This is not giving blood. This is drunk.
What's the matter? Did you two have a fight?.
What about?
The house payments.
It was nobody. Ah... he's a poll, taker. I'm thinking of voting Democrat this year. But don't mention it to your father. How was school today?
It was great to see everybody again. But it's so boring and regimented. Most of what they teach is useless. The worst thing was lunch.
I don't feel very festive.
You accepted an invitation, Maddy's one of your best friends, and I baked the Rice Krispie squares.
Come on! Mom said you were sick. You're never happy to see me.
Why not? They're my favorite.
You have an incredible memory.
I think you should give up diving. It's dangerous.
I know you are, but you have to stop. I couldn't tell you before, I didn't know if I should. But you have to stop before you hurt yourself.
Well, you showed them. You're rich and famous and successful. And you have a beautiful wife.
I guess part of us never really leaves high school.
I'm writing a book on kite construction. What did you want to talk about?
So you think time travel is possible? For people?
Listen, you've gotta keep this a secret. You can't tell a soul. Promise?
I don't know.
You look pretty good for a corpse.
Jogging. I was running, now I'm jogging.
That's terrific. You did it. You really changed the course of your destiny.
Cheer up. Now you can give some other guy a shot. Make it up to him later and buy him a yacht.
One... two... three.  You are now awake.
Oh, go feel up your hamsters! I hear rodents put out.
Not true.  I think I'm making real progress on the microchip.
Goodbye? Where're you going? What about our partnership? I'm making real progress with the microchip.
You were meant to  You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to.
The Creed cat, that's right. Bastard's name was "Church".  Let me guess. Your dog's tissue isn't healing, pupils aren't dilating... maybe you can't find a heartbeat?
I wanted to get Geoff out of L.A. Just start things over, you know?
I suppose so.
It's been a few years.
He did. We buried him.  There's a place out in the woods... if you bury something there, it comes back alive.
Sorry about your mom.  I couldn't handle not having my mom around. Just having Gus...
I'm not burying him here...
There's a better place...
What if it's not bullshit? If I bury Zowie there, and it works...  ...he'll come back alive.
I don't know but I'm not taking any chances...
I don't know...  ...maybe it depends on what you were like before you...
Couple minutes. I saw the last shot. That was pretty cool.
In a word, Bob...
Allright. Calm down.
Andy?
Yeah. Thanks, guys.
A reaction to AZT...
You're not smiling.
One hour!
I promise!
That shit's saving your life, you asshole!
CLOSE THE FUCKING LAW BOOK!
I'm not going to die.
No sweat, buddy.
I'm seeing him this afternoon.
Sounds delightful.
One week old.
Correct. I don't.
Arline?
Beer.  We need to go over your Q and A.
I've considered that.
Want to hear my favorite aria?
You're ready, don't worry.
What do you love about it?
In my work? Yes. Calculated risks. You have to.
That happened once. People weren't talking about AIDS then, the way we are now. Or safe sex.
You'd <u>heard</u> of AIDS in 1984, 85?
I'd heard of <u>something</u>. The gay plague, gay cancer, but... we didn't know how you could get it, or that it could kill you.
That is <u>not</u> correct. I never lied about it.
Ancient. How do you think I feel? Put that thing down and give me a hug.  Andrew, stop! ... He still doesn't listen.
Thank you. No more questions.
Your Honor, if Mr. Beckett was forced by his illness to use a wheelchair, would the defense ask him to park it outside? We're talking about AIDS, we're talking about lesions. Let's <u>see</u> what we're talking about.
Right.
Not by touching, or shaking hands, or hugging, using the same toilet... Even kissing someone with AIDS is safe. But it there's something in your past you're worried about...
Five months ago you characterized Andrew Beckett as caviar and now you're calling him a cheeseburger. Your standards have shifted a great deal, and I'd like to know why you've changed your mind.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... do you think... ? You think <u>I'm</u>...  ... gay?
Not especially.
Lots.
Duh...
Lisa, c'mon. One guy sticking his dick in another guy's mouth? It's disgusting.
Night, honey.
Going on... like...?
Joseph Miller, Your Honor. Macready and Shilts Legal Services.
No. We don't... However, as regards this witness, I'm going to sustain the defense's objection.
Your Honor? May I have ten minutes in re-direct?
You have to make a decision: is this guy partner material?
<u>What</u>?
Oh, sure. Why not? Sounds like a hoot.
You sure you can keep --
Here. Make it easy on you.
No one's gonna blame you. C'mon. Take my hand and save yourself, Carolyn.
Like the light is scalding it.
It hurts them. Light actually hurts them....
You see anybody else here? Just between you and me.
Ease up, ease up. JOHNS! Just tell me what....
I <u>am</u> sure. Look, murders aside, Riddick belongs in the Asshole Hall of Fame. He loves the jaw-jackin', loves making you afraid, 'cuz that's all he has. And you're playing right into --
I never said I was.
-- she tried to blow the whole fucking passenger cabin, tried to kill us --
I mean, I mean, chrono shows we're 22 weeks out, so gravity wasn't supposed to kick in for another 19. I mean, I mean, I mean, why did I fall <u>at all</u>?
And you're certain you can find the way back? Even in the dark?
No, I'm not. But <u>he</u> can.
Didn't say that. But least this way I don't have to worry about falling asleep and not wakin' up.
Like an emergency life-raft, right?
For what? The honor of goin' back to some asshole of a cell?
Not afraid of the dark, are you?
Well, what's it look like now?
Just realized that, huh?
Oh, you're a piece of art, Johns. They oughtta hang you in a museum somewhere. Or forget the museum -- maybe they should just hang you.
What are you doing there?
And now you know the truth.  Cornelius has beaten you, Doctor. He proved it. Man preceded you here. You owe him your science, your language, whatever knowledge you have.
Oh, Cornelius, be quiet.
But what about your theory? The existence of someone like Taylor might prove it.
How can scientific truth be heresy? What if Taylor is exactly the proof you needed? A mutation. A missing link between the unevolved primate and the ape -
Oh, Cornelius, show some strength!
These animals are dirty, doctor. They stink, and they carry communicable diseases. Why aren't they cleaned up before they're brought here?
Show this to the President.
Don't be silly. He's perfectly tame.
Huh?
He's trying to form words.
To Earth! That we've landed!
Forget it. Abandon ship.
Prove it. If we can't get back, it's still just a theory.
It's a fact, Landon. Buy it. You'll sleep better.
I'm prepared to die.
Climb off me, will you!
Don't bother
He wouldn't leave her.
Dr. Zira! Silence that man!
That's exactly what Zira and Cornelius claim. You're talking heresy, doctor.
Then you admit --
Of course, you could return with us. Our society might find a place for you and your mate.
I do not state it, sir. The prisoner does.
Sirs: our theories have a bearing on his identity.
That reminds me, I gotta take a shit.
Don you worry Bunny, youse a killer anyway.
Y'ever look at yoself in the mirror Junior, youse uglier than a dick on a dog man. 
Fuck this shit! I ain't dyin' in no white man's war! Ise didi-ing this motherfuckah!
What?
Then the worm has definately turned for you man.
What you got there - beers?
Nah...
What are the heads?
Well sometimes a man jes don' wanna go back. How you gonna talk to civilians man? People back in the world just don't give a shit, y'know what I mean, to them you're a fuckin' animal is all -
Who gives a shit!
I gotta didi man. Don't wanna miss that chopper. I'll send you a postcard. After I get me some. I'll send you some tapes too man. This new guy Jimi Hendrix man, whew... you okay Taylor? Just 'member take it easy now, don't think too much, don't be a fool, no such thing as a coward cause it don't mean nuthin. Jes keep on keepin' on. Okay my man...
So what am I going to do! Get one of my guys zapped so some fuckface fresh from the World can get his beauty fucking sleep!
Hey O'Neill why don't you cool it, you don't have to be a prick everyday of your life, you know.
No I don't. I don't know what the fuck you're talking about, Elias! 
This ain't Taylor. Taylor been shot. This man Chris been resurrected...
Barnes gets killed, his jaws'd go on clacking...
Bah, you're a child, Lerner. Rhah don't waste time on you.
These two holes are yours...
Yes?

Next time you try that, Mr. Mitchell...  ..don't. I'm warning you.
How long would that take?
I don't need it that badly. I don't enjoy crashing other people's parties.
I didn't say anything.
Don't take it so big... it isn't a tragedy.
There's one less tonight.
Certainly not to me.
Just who are you, anyway?
So have I.
From you, I like it.
Wrote it in the waiting room of the Hudson Bay Store.  With somebody's Pekingese trying to climb into my lap.  Perhaps you're right.  Perhaps I didn't mean it. All I know is that I'm licked.
That wasn't why I called you.  Why did I hope--when I hadn't any right to hope?
Killaine...
It did, but it never paid off-- until now.  I ought to be back within an hour. We can't leave until near dark anyway.
Killaine's wise to what?
I can still see the shoreline. The moon is rising.
That's right.
Larry Mitchell found out.  So you killed him.
If it was an accident, you could have told the truth.
No.  I paid him off.
Magruder obliged me.  No use my saying it wasn't planned that way. I had to clean up.  I'm not a dumb- smart college boy anymore.  Nobody in the world would believe I didn't plan the whole thing.
Don't go soft on me, baby.  I've got your note in my pocket.  You wrote it, all by your own self. And I have to use it.  It has to be found in exactly the right place.
So that I will never be found.
Me?
I'd like a dry Martini. Very dry, please.
Beer or ale, Miss?
You probably know the type. You find them in hotels and resorts all over the world. They always have clothes, and money, and usually have had three or four husbands. They dress and enamel themselves with great care. They worry a great deal about those little lines at the corner of the eyes.. And they demonstrate their incompetence at the art of living bet getting mixed up with people like Larry Mitchell.  Tell me about yourself, Miss Mayfield.
I was born in New York City. I grew up. And here I am.
Miss Mayfield, the humor of the situation escapes me. Within 24 hours I shall know officially whether Mitchell was murdered. Privately, I'm quite sure of it now. It happened in your room, and you came to Vancouver with him.. At any rate, he made your hotel reservation.. And you arrived together. Here in this room he behaved nastily to you, and you said something to him which might be taken as a threat.  A few hours later he was found dead on your balcony. Would it be too much too suggest that all these circumstances taken together are a little suspicious?
Would you be satisfied if I said I shot him?
Why don't you arrest me and be done with it.
Is it a crime?
We're 98 per cent certain Mitchell was murdered. There are a lot of reasons.  Was he very drunk when you last saw him?
If I understand what you meant by that.
I don't want to talk.
You wouldn't even try  There must be some copper in you, or you wouldn't be an inspector.
That's they're business.  Can I drop you somewhere?
I'm not sure I want anything from you. You might want something from me.
Information--protection--you might even want to hire me to go home and listen to the radio.  That's the funny part of my business-- once in a while, I get hired not to work.  Nice girl you were with last night. Known her long?
What are your rates?
Quit trying to scare me, Mr. Brandon, I'm neurotic.
You mentioned information.
That comedian?
How's life treating you?
Somebody Mitchell picked up on the train. I don't even know her name.
We do, when we get the chance.
Delightfully. Every time Miss Mayfield says something, I know less than I did before.  Well, I may as well knock off for tonight.  Good night, Miss Mayfield. Do let me thank you for your cooperation.
Could we discuss that some other time?
Mitchell was killed down here.  How could Clarendon get in to do it?  Or Margo for that matter.
How could Mitchell?  After that act he put on up here, is it likely she'd let him in?
You don't buy it.  Okay.  So I still want Betty Mayfield.  Where is she?
Where would she go, anyway.  Don't tell me you haven't got her covered.
Lay off what? This is my new girl friend. Met her on the train. She's very fond of me. Love at first sight. Wasn't it, baby?
You don't throw guests out, Brandon.
Mr. Mitchell.
Rather more than a little something, Mr. Mitchell.
Oh, shut up!  You haven't even got your spats on.
Or--since one is a well-known and respected guest--one could go to the desk in the lobby and say "Miss Mayfield seems to have lost her room key--have you another"?  They always have another.
You nasty, sardonic--
With what motive?
Thank you. It is rather late... and I'm not young anymore. Good night.
It's her room. She only got to the Hotel this afternoon,. With him.  I guess he took too much for granted. Here's the gun.
There wasn't any motive...let's try out the act.
I think so.
I've handled it.  Mitchell's handed it.  If I wipe it off, no suicide. If I take it out and lose it, no suicide.  If I leave it here....no suicide.
So?
I've got to find a way to handle it, openly.  Like Brandon.
If she didn't--if luck was against him--he wipes the gun off, reaches the wall up there--drops it on the chaise.
That depends upon your motive. You were in love with Mitchell, weren't you?
It does.  May I go now? 
How about Magruder?
A little of both, sir, and perhaps not quiet enough of either.
Identification on possible, Sir. Not conclusive.
I do.
You think I'm wrong about this bit of a girl.  Go out and prove it against me!
You already have the checks, darling.
In an hour, Larry.
Unsophisticated?  If I knew about this babe...
Well, I'd hate to be a nuisance.
Don't be silly.  I'll look out some more Suez material for you. You'll be very welcome.
You know the lingo.  Jolly good. So your language will have to be simple, not stupid, mind, but simple, very, very simple, and always remember it's an American readership.
Like I was saying, the American angle in Suez is very important. I wouldn't want to say they let us down.  I think that's wrong.  A good ally is one who doesn't back you up in your mistakes, who tells you when to pull back.  And the Americans were good allies.  Simple as that.
I thought it was tremendous.
I think it went on rather too long.
Good theory.  But I like my mother. I have no aversions to what she does.
No.  We talked about history, and Siberian Geese.
Yes.  Might.  Remember, you're here to talk to my mother.
That'll be fun
We were just chortling over that. BlasÃ© and epicene.  It perfectly describes the new Foreign Secretary. So--I hope you don't mind, Edward, I pinched it for my piece today.
I'll ring you.
I'm not sure.
They don't count.
Take a look at these.
Fifteen news items.  I got exactly the same running order as the bulletin desk.  They're all old pros.
Dad.
Yes, you said.
I'll ring you in the next couple of days.
U-huh.
You're so famous now.
Yeah, my knee got folded about 90 degrees the wrong way.
They're punks.  Nazis.  Their brains are wired wrong.  They hurt surfing because they give nothing back, and they have no respect for the sea. They just want to get radical.  It's mindless aggression.  They'll never get it, the spiritual side of it.
De nada.
Yeah, right, vision is highly over- rated.
You gotta earn trust.
Around somewhere.  Listen, I'm in kind of a hurry, Johnny U.  What can I do for you?
Jesus Christ, Bodhi!
All the food groups?  Avoiding sugar?  Caffeine?  I see to it that my people maintain cardiovascular fitness.  We stay off hard liquor, cigarettes...
I take the skin off chicken.
What?
Yeah, I get it.  Time to play let's dick the old guys, huh, Harp?
What that?
So you're gonna coast to retirement, when you could nail these guys and go out with come dignity.
Another month and we don't see 'em again 'til next summer.
Patience hotshot.  Patience.  It'll be subtle, if it's here at all.
Remember, all bank robbers are losers, but not all losers are bank robbers.
Cute.  He was inside for about 20 minutes.  The other guy, Roach, waited in the truck.  They were scoping it out, right?!
You sure?!
No, no.  See, all my life I've done things for other people.  In high school I played football because my old man expected me to.  Then my parents always figured I'd go to law school, so I did.  Football scholarship.  Graduated Phi Beta Kappa--
Tomorrow, 6 AM.  Here.  If you're a minute late I'm gone.  And Stud... I didn't take you to raise.  I can show you a few things but after that you're on your own. That'll be four fifty.
What are you talking about?
Tyler, put the gun down.
You tell me the fucking truth Johnny... did your parents really die in a car crash?  DID THEY?!
Carefully, tough guy.  Very carefully.
We take her and she'll give away our position, every chance she gets. No prisoners, Dillon.
We're going to need everyone.
This isn't your style, Dillon.
I'll take him.
Thank you, Sergeant.
The best friend I ever had.
What's that, General?
Mmmnnn...?
Same business, guerrillas hauling two guys from the chopper... followed by men with American equipment...
Philip!  We'll need shoes!
You're not getting any navy contracts.
Huh?  Oh... yeah.  S'okay?  Uhm... how're... business things going.
Hope to be?
It is <u>not</u> your company.  It's a public company.  And I <u>am</u> going to acquire it.  Either I buy from the other stock holders, or I buy from you.
Yes.
Actually, I'm a movie star out for a walk.
What do you want it to be?  Vivian, my name's Vivian.
Sorry.  If I did, I didn't mean to.
Edward.  My name is Edward.
C'mon, I might buy a company some day.
Don't drown.
Five full nights... days too?
Let's hope so.  You'll get some more clothes tomorrow.  I'll be pushed for time so meet me in the hotel lobby at seven forty-five sharp.  Got it?
We're the exactly the same!  Kit keeps telling me don't get emotional when you turn tricks -- that's why no kissing -- it's too personal. The key is like you're saying, stay numb, don't get involved -- when I'm with a guy, I'm a robot, I just do it.  Except with you.  At your price I give my all...
Well, you know those cold bitches that work in those stores and try to intimidate you?  It works.
Dinner can wait.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Vivian...
The opera.
Vivian, don't be afraid of what you don't know.  That's the fun of it.
I more than liked it.
It's all just business to you. Him.  Me.  Your life. Everything's business.
I'm leaving.  Don't ya see?  If I stay with you like you want me to, there'll always be some guy, your friends eve, treatin' me like that... thinkin' they're allowed to.  What are you gonna do, fight'm all? No.  I'll take my money now, please.
Vivian...
Of course, yes.  If you'll excuse me just a moment --
Edward, if the three of us sit down together we might as well announce our plans in the Wall Street Journal.
I'm here.
Our contract guys are working on the Kross pension funds. There's another forty million there.  We can bleed'm dry.
Come on, Bill, don't talk to me about how much money's involved. It's my money.
Hear me out.  I've known you a long time.  I see a difference in you this week.  Like that tie. I'm suddenly wondering if this girl's not the difference. Especially when I see her talking with David Kross.
Bill?  Stop panicking.  Kross isn't going anywhere and I don't need to spend the rest of the day watching his stock go down.  I'll be in the office tomorrow.
Promise me you'll read those contracts by then.
I'm up.
All this because of that whore!
Honey, you're not supposed to do that.
Dummy.
I pray for that.
Go for the bucks.
Thanks!  Consuelo, are all rich people so lazy they can't do this on their own?
You're a guest here?
I rather hoped you'd be wearing it.
I didn't want to get it messed. I got shoes too.  Wanna see?
Actually, some of the richest people I know have the worst manners.  Of course, Mr. Harris, being of old money, knows his way around a table.  All right now, pay attention please.  Salad fork.
Then you would use your--
Yes...
I didn't ask if it would fit. I asked how much it was.
No, I'm sorry, I don't.
I just might do that.
Don't worry.  I'll pay for it. What a you charge?  Huh?  Twenty, thirty, fifty bucks, <u>maybe</u>?  Are you a fifty dollar whore?
May I live a thousand years and never hunt again.
I swear it will be done.
Yes. Yes, of course. Naturally, not those four.
I-would-not-say-such things-if- Iwere-you-
I was giving you a chance. No matter where you take me ... there's no greater hunter than Prince Humperdinck. He could track a falcon on a cloudy day. He can find you
Nothing you can say will upset me.
Faithfulness he talked of, madam. Your enduring faithfulness. Now, tell me truly. When you found out he was gone, did you get engaged to your prince that same hour, or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead?
Hear this now: I will come for you.
The country across the sea. The sworn enemy of Florin.  Go!
You were supposed to be this colossus. You were this great, legendary thing. And yet he gains.
Perhaps not. I feel fine.
How long do we have to wait before we know if the miracle works?
Over the Albino, I think.
Open it up.
Keep your shirt on. Let me read.  Westley had no money for marriage. So he packed his few belongings and left the farm to seek his fortune across the sea.
The Eel doesn't get her. I'm explaining to you because you looked nervous.
No. You could read a little bit more ... if you want. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           17.
-- yes, you're very smart. Shut-Up.
You want me to read this or not?
Who gets Humperdinck?
Form a Brute Squad then. I want the Thieves' Forest emptied before I wed.
It won't be easy, Sire.
I don't think I'm quite familiar with that phrase.
The loser ran off alone.  The winner followed those footprints toward Guilder!
Shall we track them both?
Yes.
Let me explain --  -- No, there is too much. Let me sum up.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           99.
Are you the Miracle Max who worked for the King all those years?
Okay. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           97.
You've done nothing but study swordplay?
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to die.
Okay.
Well, it's the only way I can be satisfied. If I use my right -- tch -- over too quickly.
I'm not listening.
A good hour. Yeah.
Scared.  Can't talk.
Do the books!  Do the books!
Yes, sir.  Thank you.
Koff, koff ... ahem, ahem ... harrumph ...
According to the backer's list you raised $60,000.  But the show you produced only cost fifty-eight thousand.  There's two thousand dollars unaccounted for.
It's not cheating ... It's charity. Bloom, look at me ... look at me! I'm drowning.  Other men sail through life.  Bialystock has struck a reef.  Bloom, I'm going under.  I am being sunk by a society that demands success, when all I can offer is failure.  Bloom, I'm reaching out to you.  Don't send me to jail.  Help!  Help!
All right.  I'll do it.  I'll do it.
Well, it's very easy.  You simply raise more money than you really need.
What did I do?
Ahhhhhh!  But that's where you made your error.  You didn't go all the way.  You see, if you were really a bold criminal, you could have raised a million.
But what if the play was a hit?
What scheme?
You're going to jump on me.  I know you're going to jump on me -- like Nero jumped on Poppea.
What are you afraid of?  I'm not going to hurt you!  What's the matter with you?
I don't know.  Let's see.  We've had chocolate, vanilla, banana - let's go green.
Stop talking like that, you white mouse!  Nothing's going to go wrong. As a matter of fact, today I have taken steps to insure total disaster. At two o'clock we have an appointment with none other than Roger De Bris.
No way out.  No way out.  What?  Who?
Why don't we go over to the theatre and see what's really happening? After all, we've only heard from a small portion of the audience. Let's hear what the majority thinks.
Mr. Liebkind, wait.  You don't understand.
My play?  You mean, "Springtime For ... " you know who?
Yes.
You're not, as you Americans say, dragging my leg, are you?
Oh, sure.  I used to take him his hot milk and his opium.  Achhh, those were the days.  Vat good times ve had.  Dinner parties vit lovely ladies and gentlemen, singing und dancing.  You know, not many people knew about it, but the Fuhrer vas a terrific dancer.
That's because you were taken in by that verdampter Allied propaganda. Such filthy lies.  But nobody said a bad vord about Winston Churchill, did they?  Oh no, Vin Vit Vinnie!  Churchill, vit his cigars and his brandy and his rotten paintings. Couldn't even say Nazi.  He would say Narzis, Narzis.  Ve vere not Narzies, ve vere Nazis.  But let me tell this, and you're getting it straight from the horse, Hitler vas better looking than Churchill, he vas a better dresser than Churchill, had more hair, told funnier jokes, and could dance the pants off Churchill!
But he has long hair!
All right, but remember, if you damage the Fuhrer's reputation, I kill you.
Yes.  Amazing isn't it?
All right.  Finish the job.  Let's get outta here.
Good.  Let's fool around.  Now, I'll be the innocent little milk maid and you'll be the naughty stable boy.  Oh, this milk is so heavy.  I'll never reach the house.  Help.  Will someone help me?
Oh, the best one.
Until Thursday, then, Contessa Mio.
Rudolfo, you dirty pig!  Pull over.
Thursday.  I'll see you Thursday.
I shall count the minutes.
Til Thursday, my Darling, I shall count the minutes.
Wagner...
Good.  Good.  Now ve sign the contract.
"Deutchland, Deutchland, uber alles, Uber alles in der velt."
Who can we attack?  They're all too big.
Hey, man, let's stomp Switzerland!
Send for Goebbels.
Groovy!
I'm looking for a missing person.  My name's Arbogast, private investigator...  Trying to trace a young girl who's been missing almost a week. From Phoenix.  It's a private matter... family wants to forgive her...  She isn't in trouble.
No. No one has stopped here in weeks...
Very early. Dawn.
The following morning. Sunday.
Oh. My private parlor. She had an awful hunger... so I made her some supper. And then she went to bed and left in the morning. I didn't even see her leave.
Why should she? I'm sorry, I have work to do, Mr... if you don't mind...
I don't know what you expect me to know about... people come and go...
My mother.
I didn't mean that as a slur on your manhood. I'm sorry.
Not even a hunch. Just hope.
Five hundred.
Caroline...? Mary still isn't in?
Her sister's going to do that.  She's as worried as we are.
With you.
Don't you know?
What do you know about it?
Nothing! You're putting me on the defensive.
He must have had a darn good reason for wanting them kept out of it... All that cash...
Why not? Sam, is she hiding here? Are you two planning to go away with the money?
I didn't see her... and I didn't hear from her! Believe that!
It's been three.
Are we just going to go on sitting here?
He'll be back. Let's sit still and hang on, okay?
I feel better when you feel better.
That wouldn't be a wise thing to do.
Patience doesn't run in our family. Sam, I'm going out there!
Why can't I go out there with you?
Maybe he got some definite lead. Maybe he went right on...
Nothing.  Just... all the lights out... must be asleep.
We were going to get married. Are going to get married!
What?
Yes.  But maybe this proves that Bates found out about the money.
We could laze around here a while longer.
I pay, too. They also pay who meet in hotel rooms.
I knew you must have. No one stops here anymore unless they do.
I'll be in the office if you want anything... just tap on the wall.
No.
It's all for you. I'm not hungry. Please go ahead.
Why do you ask that?
No, not like me.
It's too late for me. And besides... who'd look after her? She'd be alone up there, the fire would go out... damp and cold, like a grave. When you love someone, you don't do that to them, even if you hate them. Oh, I don't hate her.  I hate... what she's become. I hate... the illness.
Frankly, yes.
No need to apologize...
Please.
Let's go out back and have some coca while the men are talking.
He's already been.
At this hour?
You must remember that bad business out there. About ten years ago...
He told you he wasn't coming right back cause he wanted to question Norman Bates' mother, right?
Better sign in first, hasn't we?
I always thought it was the people who are alone so much who do all the talking when they get the chance. Yet there you are, doing all the listening!  You are alone here, aren't you?  It would drive me crazy.
I didn't think so.
Leave me alone!
This detective was out there and Norman told him about the girl and the detective thanked him and went away.
You didn't even mention the suicides. Did you notice the beaut that came in today?
No, not exactly. Why the great anxiety? It must be something important.
[Perfectly friendly, my dear.] At last, I have really a secure living for us. We can travel or anything we choose.
Oh, no. It's my own idea. I'm in the business. In the fur business.
That's it. You get it quick.
I'd like to have a look.
Yes. Mr. Buckley thinks you treated him a little rough. He's in the hospital. How about it?
He isn't here.
That called ... commanded ...
Yes.
No -- I didn't. It was Igor at the waxworks.
I don't think you could have a real affair. You couldn't care for anyone.
What's the rush? There's no first act. They'll all be there and we don't have to appear at any particular time.
Well, thank goodness, that's settled.
Oh, you children, you happy children. You've quarreled and now you're going to be friends again. And that is as it should be. Never let any stupid misunderstandings come between you.
But it was really my fault.
And he will probably demand the life of anyone who agrees with you. Let him think it was his fault ... He should be along very shortly .. . But be very stern before you forgive him, especially if it is your fault  ...  While you're waiting for your friend, would you like to see some new figures I have downstairs?
If this kid was some unknown soda jerker, they wouldn't have pinched him. But he's George Winton and they're playing him up. It's a Roman holiday for every paper hat editor in New York.
Sleep on it ... we'll get it tomorrow.
I asked you to keep your trap shut!
Listen, Jo-jo. Does this mean anything to you? Joan Gale's body swiped from the morgue -- Did you ever hear of such a thing as a death mask?
That dear, innocent Judge Ramsey that you were so sure got bumped off for knowing too much has been located in South America.
Almost! I'll still bet I'm right, and let you write your own ticket.
Was there any art on Judge Ramsey?
Well, maybe it was. I don't remember.  You got to do something for me, I can't stand it any longer -- I can't!
I've got to make news, if I have to bite a dog.  Hey, Kelly! Oh, mi gosh, even he walked out on me.
Old Howard Winton's cub?
Say, if you're stringin' me, Old-Timer ...
What do you mean police dog?
No. I wanted to do it without saying anything. I think he's worth it.
Your dad has stood for plenty. Now let's get down to cases. When did you see the Dale girl last?
They didn't give me a chance. We had a couple of drinks and she was all right then. She seemed happy.
Well, let's get back to the case in hand. They ordered an autopsy and discovered her body had been stolen from the morgue.
Darned if I don't! 
She will undoubtedly keep her promise. If you'll grant me the privilege, I'd like to submit this work to the Royal Academy when I get back.
No -- I'm lying to amuse myself!  Now look here, I've an idea that will get us out of all this. We haven't twopence between us, but we've got these. 
Everything, my friend. And you hope to be a great sculptor --  A great sculptor. Look -- this forearm is at least two inches too long.
I will only be gone about half an hour.
Don't lose sight of him. This is the most important thing in my life.
Excuse me???
It's an experiment.
She isn't here. And I'm sorry, but Mr. Hillyer doesn't want her to have callers during working hours.
In what sense were they bad?
You know, that Daddy of yours is the funniest man, the things he says, you never know what's going to come out of his mouth next.
Hmmph. It has a nipple, all right.
Well, now that is just too bad! Curiosity killed the cat.
No! You ought to be ashamed of yourself astin' such a nasty things a child your age!
Yes, I do. Please, Rose, be a good sport.
No. No, I'm all right.  Oh, God, what have I done? I have robbed a cradle and fallen into hell!  I must be crazy, a child like you. Oh, God, oh, Lord. This is awful, this is terrible, I gotta get outta here!
I sure hope you don't.  I gotta get outta here, good night.
Buddy, Mr. Right is out there somewhere and I'm gonna find him!
Yeah.
Well, he might be that man who followed me home from the store the other day. But I don't know who he is, Buddy, I really don't.
Rose, you are too uncritical of people.
He did?
Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.
I don't know.
What's taking the rascal so long?
No.
I think Daddy suspects.
At least.
I can't see, let me see...
Is that all?
Buddy, I'm worried about Rose.
Then why does she act so dumb?
It's funny you would mention Rose, I was thinking about her all the way up in the car.  Or maybe it isn't so funny.
No, son, she is dead.
That's a hell of a thing to say. Why, Rose?
First, about the girl's history. Evidently she's been very promiscuous since early childhood, she has no control over her sexual impulses. Furthermore, she is permanently barren, she can't have children.
I have of course observed the girl in treating her.
What do you think of her, honey?
There are no flies on Rose, I don't know what you're talking about.
You're a wonderful woman, darlin'. As long as you're around, I'm sure the sun wouldn't dare go out.
No, darlin'. Just that damnable insomnia in reverse. I sleep like a baby for an hour then I'm wide awake. You go back to sleep.
You're not having lunch?
Well, time will tell, won't it?
I don't care where the polecat studied.
Sometimes the negativism and cynicism in you makes me want to vomit.  Your real trouble is that you're anti-intellectual. The irony is women are supposed to be emotional, but I never saw anybody who depended more on emotion and prejudice than you do.
The hell we can't.
Just a minute, Rose, you don't understand. This isn't a dirt farm like the one you were born on, it's nice. A neighbor of Cousin Hop's, I talked to him on the phone, a fine man... it's not a farm, damn it, it's a beautiful dairy establishment! Stop crying, Rose! Do you hear me? Stop crying, it's ideal!
It sounds like a farm to me. Calling it a dairy establishment, that's just trickery and flummery.
No, sir.
Um-hmmuhh. I never drink a whole cup, my nerves can't stand the caffeine. Ehh-hh, Lord awful insomnia in reverse last night. Lay there and sweated blood for hours.
It'll do just fine.  Bye-bye, see you later.
Yes, sir.
Wonderful. Except I can touch the place back there with my tongue, I wouldn't even know I had that tooth pulled.
Well, I know it, I just got the bill for it.
Umm. Well. Yes. But no more strange voices in the night, Rose.
Rose, darlin', you break my heart. But I am only a human man myself of the father variety. Rose, pack your bag, baby, as of this moment you are hired, mired and fired.
Yes, Tennessee, a lovely state!
What?
It's Dave Wilkie! I'm Dave Wilkie, don't you remember me?
Heh heh heh heh, same old Buddy, always jokin' around. Almost as much of a joker as your Daddy.  I saw your Daddy a coupla years ago, I was up in Glenville lookin' at a motel site. I guess that's where you're headed, huh, to see him?
Exactly, and that's why she couldn't possibly have come from such a farm.
No, you shouldn't have, it was needlessly cruel. She thinks she has cancer and is going to die.
Well, I am working on my thesis.
Oh, no, that's the style. It's meant to be clinging.
I know it was bad, honey. I'm sorry...
Well, you're real sweet to make it for me.  There never was nobody like you. And you don't need to worry, I ain't goin' out no more.
What... what makes you think you can order me around?!
Every person's got their own kinks, beef-cake.  What's wrong, Kittle?  You don't swing?
You don't.  It's a gamble.  But, not even in Vegas are you gonna get close to this kind of cash.  This is <U>two million</U>, Archie.  It's not three houses, it's twelve.  It's dreams come true.
Nothing, I guess.  Just an observation.  She's really something special.  You're a lucky fella.
No you can't.
I'd rather you guys didn't do this again.
What of it?  Haven't we waited forever... ?  Haven't we, honey?  Haven't we waited long enough to get this scumbag?
Yeah.
I don't know.  I could quit now if I wanted, I just don't want to.
It's just the way things are, kiddo.
Well, I would like to sit in front today.
Wha... ?
This is the police lock-up.  We're police.  How can we steal from ourselves?
Can't you say something nice once?
You going rogue on me?
Well, sir...
You're about an inch away from insubordination!
Just wanted to make you aware... before today's over, we'll be standing on top of your mountain of horse and pissing down on you.
Whoops... don't mind me.  Go ahead and finish up.
Shit.  You're right.
Out here.  On your knees.
Chalk up another victory for Billy-Boy's one man war on crime.
Who is that... ?
You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view.
Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.
Yes, my Master.
I gotta get you out of here.
Hold me.
It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.
Come on! Come on!
Let's see.
There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must. If I don't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance.
Then you know why I have to face him.
Give yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your friends. Yes, your thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially for...
Your father he is.
I told you, my car broke down.
And now he works for your Government, doesn't he, Brad?  He's attached to the Bureau of Investigation of that which you call U.F.O's.  Isn't he, Brad?
I've one thing to say and that's Dammit, Janet. I love you.
Everyone knows Betty's a wonderful little cook.
We must have a blow-out.
Oh...
Say!  Do any of you guys know the Madison?
It's alright Janet.
Janet!  Oh!  Yes it's alright.  Janet. Everything's going to be alright.
You know this earth - this person.
A decision had to be made.
Like this - like how?  It's your fault. You're to blame.  I was saving myself.
Makes you cry
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
My mother told me just the opposite. She said, 'You weren't born with much of a body so you'd better develop your brain.'
...I suppose.
It's all right -- You're my guest.
They're all the same.
But I'm willin' to make the best of this uncomfortable situation.
Yeah... But I think weak legs ain't bad sometimes, y'know.
Yeah...
It ain't so bad, 'cause I was a nothin' before --
That so.
I want 'im outta here --  Don't think I'm good enough to work for Gazzo?  That's what I think of bums like you an' Gazzo!  You're goin' up an' don't care enough to throw Paulie some crumbs!  I give ya meat, an' I give ya my sister, too!
Only a pig would say that!
What?!
...I don't feel heat from the name.
Sure -- He can hit -- Don't play no more -- Stick an' move, hear?
Don't play with this man, he's fightin' hard -- Let 'em feel some real heat!
Get that doctor.
You're hurtin', man!
Don't kill yourself, man -- Let the doctor stop the fight.
Don't matter -- That name. 'The Italian Stallion,' it's right on.  Who discovered America? An Italian, right? So, man, what could be better than to get it on with one of his ancestors --
You're referring to the much publicized bicentennial fight?
Where're you off to now?
Any quick advice for young boxing hopefuls?
Don't like yours neither.
Kiss my ass.
Move your shoulders down.
Wait here, gotta smooth this guy out.
That's it? -- Completely?
Ya still light seventy.
Ya sure?
He's always in a bad mood.  Count ya blessin's. Ya a healthy person -- ya legs work -- ya hands work --
Yeah.
I'm gonna do somethin with it.
No -- Just me.
What?
What'd you say?
Hey! When I was your age, there was only one girl who talked like that in the whole neighborhood.
C'mon, Rocky. I'm twelve.
Ya, somethin' like that.
'Night, Marie.
I said, how ya feelin'?
Dipper needed it.
The legs must be goin'.
Think about it.
Here's the card?
Ya got a good mind for dates.
Whatever I got, I always got on the slide. This shot's no different. I didn't earn nothin' -- I got it on the slide... I needed ya help about ten years ago when I was startin', but ya never helped me none.
Breathe deep -- Keep ya chin down!! Use the legs and drive through 'im. Attack -- Attack -- Attack!
Damn! How's it look?
Can't hardly tell. Don't swallow the blood -- Go for his ribs. Don't let 'im breathe.
Fine... That guy's great.
Yo, can I have my locker back?
Bullmastiff.
Every mornin', every night I pass by -- I smile. I say jokes. Nothin'. She looks at me.
Looks, huh?
Hey --
An' you're dyin' alone, too.
I don't see no crowd around you, neither.
Ya gotta have a guy help ya exercise, mebbe somebody to be standin' by with a towel or run errands, y'know.
Without havin' good people around, ya won't have such a good chance.
...Tight.
I thought I was doin' ya a favor -- C'mon inside -- Y'know, my sister really likes ya.
...It's cold outside, Paulie.
Do you have anything derogatory to say about the Champion?
You mean the rabbit?  They got him cold.
C'mon, Valiant, doesn't this whole thing smell a bit funny to you?  I mean, no offense, but how did a mucky-muck like R.K. Maroon find you in the first place?
Somebody took it from him.  That's what this whole thing's about.
Shoulda guessed.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
Then why'd they bother to crack the safe?  You can drop a Mosler 90 from Mount Baldy and it won't open.
Yeah, do that.  I'm gonna go rattle Maroon's cage.
What've I got to lose?  You okay, Dolores?
That's what this is all about?  Tell me, who's gonna use your lousy freeway? We got the Red Cars, the best public transportation in the country.
Eddie?  Jesus, what happened?
No, no, no... I love my husband.
He's right here in the...
A joker to the end.
So what?  He's already put me three weeks behind on the shooting schedule!
Only there's no business like it, no business I know.
So what do you want me to do?
A hundred bucks?  That's ridiculous.
As soon as is humanly possible.
Yeah, that's better.
Gee, I didn't recognize you... I've never seen you laugh before.  That your brother makin' the rabbit ears?
Him?  Oh, he was vile, heinous, despicable... a smear on the drafting board.
Get away from there.
How much is a shave and a haircut, Roger?
... I'd head for Cucamonga.
I will bite my thumb at them; which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
Have patience!
Tush, thou art deceived. Hast thou no letters to me from the priest? [Balthsasr shakes his head no.] No matter. Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee tonight. I will hence tonight.
Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
Why that pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline. Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
But new struck cuz.
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
Teach me how I should forget to think.
Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is; Shut up in prison, kept without my food, Whipp'd and tormented. Good day, good fellow.
Art thou hurt?
Young Romeo is it?
Content thee, gentle cuz, content thee. Let him alone; I would not for the wealth of all the town Here in my house do him disparagement: Therefore be patient, take no note of him
The world is not thy friend, nor the worlds law. Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
The last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
I have been feasting with mine enemy, where on a sudden one hath wounded me, that's by me wounded; both our remeidies within thy help and holy physic lies.
Marry my child next Thursday Morn. The gallant, young and noble gentleman, Sir Paris, at Saint Peter's Church, shall make thee there a joyful bride.
Talk not to me, for Ill not speak a word. Do as thou wilt for I have done with thee.
Farewell. God knows when we shall meet again.
[Within] Juliet!
Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I! O, my back! Other' other side,--O, my back.
Have you got leave to go to confession to-day?
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore? The garden walls are high and hard to climb, And the place death, considering who thou art, If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes, And but thou love me, let them find me here: My life were better ended by their hate, Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
O God, I have an ill-divining soul. Methinks I see thee, now thou art so low, as one dead in the bottom of a tomb. O fortune, fortune. Be fickle, fortune, for then I hope that thou will not keep him long but send him back.
Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
Not I, Not I believe me: you have dancing shoes With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings, And soar with them above a common bound.
If love be rough with you, be rough with love; Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
Meaning, to court'sy.
Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,
NO! Mercutio!
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir. And you will give me occasion.
You know it is.
Of course.
I don't want you dead, woman, I want the the truth!
The deal?  The deal is we leave for Nice at first light.
Now there's the Deirdre I know.
You're thinking with your gun, Seamus, and not your head...
Once.
I didn't think to see you again tonight. You were pretty pissed.
Nobody's saying they don't.
I probably do.  But for the time being, I'm willing to forget about it...
I didn't say I was.
Bloody fucking hell...
Next.
That was a mistake, trying to kill you. Mikhi did it without consulting me, I'd have never allowed it.
There's been a slight problem.
I'm shocked, shocked to think that you'd believe him.
I don't have it with me...
I'm in the middle of saving you people a great deal of money -- the least you could do is have the decency to pay me!
Because if there's more than one party involved, if we really are working for different people, then perhaps some of us are on different sides.  Your orders might be different from mine.
What's that?
And you respect him.
You should really let a doctor look at that.
Vincent's life is his own burden; he'll have to carry it for himself.  And I'm not any kind of Samurai.
Long enough to shoot back.
And you could stand to get a little smarter, ain't that right you dumb blonde fuck?
I blast the lead car into oblivion...
Is that right?
Not in mine.
I don't.  But the language he's speaking is universal.
I asked if we could give him anything else.
What's the difference?
I wanted to see who you were.
Because that's what I would have done...
You don't.  You just learn to live with it.
You're with Interpol -- you're a cop.
If I was a cop, a real cop, I'd have busted you a long time ago.  This isn't about you, it's about the job I have to do.
I'm going with you.
Thorough man.
Continue when it would be so much easier to give it up.
Something like that.
If our positions were reversed, would you leave me?
Yeah.  We need out fucking heads examined.
It's the one thing I've got left to hold onto.  Jean-Pierre is one of your closest friends, is he not?
Do you have a good answer?
Finish the job...
Gone.  Destroyed.
Gonna be tough.
You said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape?
It's a matter of respect.  Why don't you wait outside, this won't take long.
I can't get enough of it.
Never heard of it.
Hell, it won't be us!
I told Trudy we were coming down this way, that's why!
Suppose someone knows about the money?  They're bound to ask questions.
Who's going to question us? Dwayne?  Jesse?
I'll worry about that when it happens and if it happens, and it's not gonna happen!
What makes you so sure?
At the expense of six people.
Well we didn't kill him, he died on his own.
We assaulted a Federal agent.  We killed him.
It's the stupid thing to do, that's what it is.
He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
What are you thinking?
Forget the copies!  He could have made up the copies -- the only thing that incriminates us is the original.
I don't know!  Shit, give me a break!
Yes I DO!  It never woulda stopped, you know that.  Jesse's always gonna be making mistakes and we'd be paying for them for the rest of our lives.
He killed her...he killed her...
Dwayne had the opportunity, just like us.  He was at the scene.  He grabbed the cash.  Of course.  This is perfect!
Yes it is.  I'm calling it in.  Right now.
My point, well...
I'm all ears.
How much?
Two thousand...
By Friday.
Well I don't know what's going to happen next -- she's pressing this, another interrogation, another problem.
No.  It's not.
OKAY! IT'S UNDER MY DESK!!  TAPED TO THE BOTTOM SIDE!!!
He's irresponsible.
No.  But he would, probably.
Are you sure you're OK?
There isn't gonna be a next time. We're gonna get out of here.
Great...
I don't know, Booth.
I'll be there for you.  He won't try anything while I'm there.  I promise.  I'll protect you.
I don't believe it.
Sounds like you don't trust me.
What?
Yeah.  I told him I'd be there before five.
Dwayne.
So there was money there!  Who the hell's money is it?!
Not exactly.  It's some lingerie store on the strip.
Yeah, racy stuff, you know the kind, right?
Anything...specific?
Have I seen her?
Yeah I'd say C...C.
Oh, that's ok, a lot of men feel uncomfortable when they come in here.
He probably figured she was on her way out anyhow, no drugs in her system, no foul play.
Vegas!  Can you hightail it back here by three o'clock?
I  have complete faith in you. But don't you go speeding.
You walked in here looking like you just ate a shit sandwich.
What?
Yeah let's hear about your day.
Listen -
Well it's not here -- you're wasting your time and you're pissing me off!
Stop!  Stop!  I don't need the money.  You can have it all.
Are you hungry?
Money.
Hong Kong?  I'm not in Hong Kong.  I'm in Hollywood -- right at Sunset and Vine, two minutes from the station.  How about I pick you up right now and take you to dinner?
And I got mine, meaning you.  Nice how that works out.  I'm serious this time, I'm closing this place down.
One of my regulars lost fifty thousand dollars at the table here last week.  I was about to send my boys down to tune his ass up, when the guy comes in and pays off the whole thing.  Including the vig -- brand new sequential hundred dollar bills.  I knew something was wrong.  Cause this guy's got a regular job, no way he comes up with fifty grand in cash. But I tested the bills, infrared.  The whole thing.  And they checked out. 100%.
Red Dragon?  You sure about that?
Throw us in jail?  I'm about to bust you right now.
Bathroom.
Are you kidding, they love me.  I'm a star, Lee.  A god to these people!
I'm sorry.
No.  You are a civilian.  In China, I am Michael Jackson, and you are Toto.
You mean Tito.  We had  Toto for dinner last night.
You're sorry.  I got somebody's old chopsticks stuck in my ass, so don't tell me you're sorry.  Just take me home.
I'm calling for back up!
You're pathetic, man.  When's the last time you had some fun?  When's the last time you took a night off, had a date?
Detective Yu?  Never met him.
I'm okay, you go.
Remember I told you my father was a policeman?  Ricky Tan was his partner for ten years.
I thought you'd think it was crazy.
Yeah, what about when Godzilla was coming?  You people were screaming your asses off.
I don't need a turn!
Get it out of here!
We can help you.  I'm a detective in Hong Kong.
You got that right.  And we ain't brothers.  Maybe we should just end this right here.
I don't believe in reincarnation.  So I won't see you in the next world.
Fine by me.
No.
What about a little king pao chicken?
Go ahead.  Sing your ass off.
Buddha is the symbol of luck and good fortune.
Dancing?
It's okay, I got lots more.
Come on, Lee.  Stop being a cop for five minutes and live it up.  There must be something you want.
Amen to that, brother.
Hey, you, Secret Service Man, what are you --
Look over there.  That's the eye in the sky room.
Dip me!
No.  But I'll help you.
No.  Freddy Ching's, in Crenshaw.
Tell me why they killed the customs agents.
Do I look like I'm movin'?!  What you're seeing here?  This is not movement. This is my "still".
This is pathetic.
Yeah, that's right.  Now that we understand each other... show me how you did that.
Look, you want to work in this country, you gotta know this crap. Okay?  We're gonna be in some deep shit here.  Working the danger zone. And you need insurance.  Cause, you know, you might be starting some riots and shit.
That silly-ass look on your face.
Bullshit!  You were trying' to lose my ass again.
Yes, I think so.
Yee-aww.
Excuse me?
This concrete?  This is still America.
Oh yes.
You drop my gun and you lose my i.d.?
Good. That's standard military packaging for plastique. Get a look under it.
In Charge.  Just me'n him.  No interference.  They don't even want to hear from us until we're done.  I love the F.B.I.  I love the F.B.I.
Well...listen, if you need any help, you know, back up, call me, OK?
Oh baby, don't worry, I'll call you. You can count on it.
That's it! You can attack me, but when you attack my car, I cannot forgive! You in the back, girl!
He is the situation.
Shut up!
Can I speak with her?
Han?
Yes.
Pack it into black garbage bags. Throw the bags into a garbage dump in the alley behind the Fang Shan Restaurant in China Town.  You have twenty-nine minutes left.
And Mr. Lee?  Where is he?
I'm just bragging about how great you are.  I'm the luckiest man alive.
What did he ask?
And what did you say?
God bless you, Maggie.
"Nothing but net."
I left four messages.  You don't return my calls.
I merely write the stuff.  You're the one that serves it up.
I'm sorry, too.  Wow.  That only took us between years to say.
Justice, yes.  Paid, I don't know. They like the idea, but my hands are tied with budget restraints.
I don't know.
Yeah.
Then you'll be my best man.
Splendid dissection of Maggie Carpenter, very professional job.
And you defending her?
Oh, please!
Excuse me, sir.  I have an actual fact for you.
Looking for Maggie.
Yep.  Maggie -- Someone to see you.
That must have made you proud.
You know, your daughter seems...
Despite what you think, I don't do it on purpose.  And I have no intention of doing it again.
How do I do it?  I'm not that beautiful.
Oh, but making up the facts as you go along is ethical?  Actually, I meant you.  You probably got severance or expenses or both.  I'll take your check. No credit cards.
You've seen the post-its.  I've already got more juicy material than I need. Why should I pay you dollar one?
Seven-fifty.
Excuse me?
What!?
Come on, it'll give you a great view. It's perfect.  Hey.
A little longer for me.
I don't know.  I, uh -- I frankly don't even want to talk about it.
Yes, I did.
Yes.
But I'm weird.
No.  You're quirky.  Quirky and weird are two different things.
See, this is a mature relationship. She's really found it.
Want to go to Butch's for a drink or something?
Maggie, it's just a joke...
Is there somebody else?
He's got a houseboat.
I hate boats.
Even when you were young?
I know.  It makes no sense at all.  Thank God my life is in place.
And then I'll see you in New York --
Walter, there's something I have to tell you --
Oh? Oh, really? Now we're getting down to it.
... movie.  That's your problem.  You don't want to be in love.  You want to be in love in a movie.  Read it to me.
"I am not the sort of person who listens to call-in radio shows" --
I'm going to marry Walter.  I just have to get this out of my system.
I don't know.  I mean, what if I never meet him? What if this man is my destiny and I never meet him?
No.  That's the weirdest part about it.
You know that dream where you're walking down the street naked and everyone is looking at you?
I saw her.  She looked just like this --
"Dear Annie: Thanks for your letter.  It was great.  We're very excited about meeting you in New York on Valentine's Day and seeing if we are M.F.E.O. Sleepless in Seattle."
I love the symphony.
So you want a financial, is he a deadbeat, we can do a D&B --
Howard.
Any time.
I know.  He's wonderful, isn't he?
Magic.
Of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department, so don't be worried if it takes a while --
Mom, we already...
Sure you do --
Magic.
Who is this?
Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of Network America.
Jesus, are we on the air? Jonah, for God's sake --
I think it's hard for him to talk to you about all this. Maybe we could talk and it would make him feel a little better.
No.
Why not?
Got me there.  What's your Christmas wish, Jonah?
She died.
Okay, but if I get yelled at, I'm never gonna listen to this show again.
Fair enough.
It is not --
Well, okay.  What's the big deal?  If she'll forget the new fireplace, I'll marry her. Just point me in the right direction.
Well.  Things are different. First, you have to be friends. You have to like each other. Then you neck.  This can go on for years.  Then you have tests.  Then you get to do it with a condom.  The good news is, split the check.
I don't get it.
But how am I going to get there?
It's never happening again. Right?
P.  Dad?
Just out of curiosity, do you have any friends whose names don't begin with a J?  I feel like it was a failure of the imagination on our part naming you Jonah.  What is marjoram? Does anyone know?
Somewhere in the middle.
I'm starting to notice that.
What do you think?
I don't know.
Her name is Annie.  Annie Reed.
Oh, right.
This is not a joke.  Thank God Victoria doesn't know.  It would really have hurt her feelings.
I'm never going to meet anyone who's going to measure up to your mom in your eyes? What do you think? There's a perfect woman walking around out there?
Thank you, Jonah.  But the point is, I am not asking permission.
Shut up.
This conversation is finished.
Hi.  Sam?
Move on.  Right.  That's what I'm going to do.  In a few months, boom, I'll be fine, I'll just grow a new heart.
I really wanted you to call me, and I thought you were never going to --
He's good at it.
Sure.  Sure.
Why didn't you give a warning signal?
You're welcome to one.
No thanks.
You haven't tried locking them up!
No, just the ring leaders. The fire-eaters. And the ones with big families ...  Barton -- where's that boy?
No, no, it's the president of the company himself -- come all the way out here to make Jenkins general manager. So why you acting so mean?
You know the beef. This new rule of yours, that we work alone. We're taking it up with the Super.
You weren't even there. You were back at the station. Kalinsky told me ...
Don't you worry. We'll get some action.
With RamÃ³n it's ... pride. I spoke out of the bitterness in me. And he was hurt.
I did forget. LuÃ­s told me.
You are no good to me -- in jail.
I don't want your dead body. I don't want you back in jail either.
But it's yours. I won't let them ...
Can't you see they want to start a fight so that they can lock you all up at one time?
NO, she wants to be there.  And there's Mrs. Kalinsky.
That meeting only lasted ten minutes.  The first night I'm home, and you run to the beer parlor. What is it? Can't you bear the sight of me?
No.
You mean you're ready to give up?
Me, I'm a camp follower -- following this organizer from one mining camp to another -- Montana, Colorado, Idaho. But did he ever think to organize the women? No. Wives don't count in the Anglo locals either.
Well, you're the organizer. You work out strike strategy -- and most of the time you're dead right. But when you figure everything the rank-and-file's to do down to the last detail, you don't give us anything to think about. You afraid we're too lazy to take initiative?
New York? You're not the Company President by any chance?
She's coming. Charley Vidal gave her a lift.
You've got to help around the house!
You should have helped her without being asked.
You ... You ... I'd expect it of an Anglo, yes ... but you ...
You think my kids have enough to eat, you rat?
I know, it's wrong. Just let me go. I'll leave town ... just let me go.
No.
How about in the house?
No, Why?
First rate, ain't it?
Because I don't know him and I don't really know you, partner.
Get used to it.  You're in a very tenuous position on the food chain, hoss.
I can't.
There's nothing to understand. The guy is a pig.
Don't worry. He's out of town.
Like you?
Nothing.
I don't want anything. Why are you so suspicious?
It gets me through the day.
You really need to lighten up.
Who the fuck are you? Dr. Joyce Brothers?
You always been this stubborn?
It's Tom.
Maybe I am dealing with it.
Lead the way.
I hadn't noticed.  I've seen you around.  What's your name?
My features. They're Finnish.
See that?  That's just what I'm talking about.
You. You're smooth. You use words like dire and shit.  You got language skills, man.
Can your man handle that?
The Del Ammo Mall mostly.
It's you! I didn't have a picture or nothin' so I had to describe you to the guy. Not bad though, huh?
You never did like me much, did you Verne?  And you can't stand it that I walked out of there alive and Liz didn't. You think I'm a coward, don't you?
Secret recipe.
But you're a friend of Jimmy's. I think of you as a brother already.
Big Bill.
Yeah.
What the fuck are you gonna do about it, dickhead?
Somebody has to help you lazy bastards.
Tell me what?
Soon. I promise.  We'll get the charges dropped and you can disappear.  In the mean time, trust me, he has no idea that you ratted him out.
Bubba.
News-flash, Tanner. I'm a fucking rat.
Who is it?
Turns out he's connected.
I still don't know what you're talking about.
Hell, yes!  What the hell do you expect zapping Mr. Johnson with that crackler?
With you clowns watching my back? What do you think?
Really?
Come on, where's your pioneer spirit?
I wanted you to ask back there.  You know, before you got us lost.
That is so unfair.
Good work, Flynne.  You're a first-rate rat.
Sector four is secured, we put out the last three German one-fifty-fives, found them about two miles in from Ponte du Hoc.
A company, Wehrmacht, no artillery, we took twenty-three prisoners, turned them over to intelligence.
But, sir...I...I...
As a matter of fact, I am.
Shut up, will you?
Looks like a flaming asshole to me.
Of course, sir.
You didn't volunteer, Jackson.
My guess, too.
Gives Wade the second shot.
White-walls?
You think the rest of us were?
But, sir...
There you go again, that's whining, that's not okay.
You tryin' to get yourself killed?
Twenty minutes ago.  Miller Damn, I'll go see if I can find another one.  You get Reiben, Jackson and Wade, meet me at transport.
Maybe.
They're fine.  As long as they can gripe, they'll be alright.
And what about you?
Rolls to his feet.  FIRE another BURST.  KILLS the last of the German riflemen.  Doesn't pause.  RUNS onto the field.
Yeah.
And what about your own hand?
No problem.  A pair of deuces?  Less? So what?  I bluff.  It used to tear me apart when I'd get one of my men killed, but what was I supposed to do?  Break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do?  Of course not, so I bluffed, and after a while, I started to fall for my own bluff. It was great, it made everything so much easier.  Sarge Is that why your hand's been shaking?
Not in so many words, but they tell you you can have all the firepower in the world and if your men don't have good morale, it's not worth a damn.  So if you're scared or empty or half-a-step from a Section Eight, do you tell your men?  Of course not.  You bluff, you lie.
Simple, numbers.  Every time you kill one of your men, you tell yourself you just saved the lives of two, three, ten, a hundred others. We lost, what, thirty-one on the cliffs?  I'll bet we saved ten times that number by putting out those guns.  That's over three hundred men.  Maybe five hundred.  A thousand. Then thousand.  Any number you want. See?  It's simple.  It lets you always choose mission over men.
John, I've got to tell you, I think you're about used up.
Well, if we had ten times the men and a lot more ammo, we might stand a chance, but not against those tanks.
Trust me, you're the best.
Yeah, how so?
There's to be a bright side, look for it.
You have orders, too.
What if our guys open up, sir?
I coach the baseball team, too.
This bridge cannot be held.  The Germans have two companies less than three miles from here.  They have tanks.
Upham and Jackson, what were they like?
Get lost.
We know.
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
Pardon me?
Well, take a look around the house.  Is everything nice, but not too nice?  Are there lots of, uh, rugs, pieces of art, stereo equipment, uh, furniture, a lot of things bought with cash?  Does he give a lot of gifts?  Do the major items in your house cover around the nine thousand-dollar range?
Understanding the following rights...
What family?  We never heard from them.  I sold her house for them, made them money.
Jesus Christ.  I get in a good mood.  How hard is it just to decide to be in a good mood, and then be in a good mood?
Yeah.
Forget it, forget it, it's mine, it's mine!
Lloyd, listen to me.  EVERYTHING has changed.  You've had sex. No matter what you might think, nothing will ever be the same between you two.  You might be sixty.  You might be walking down the street, and you'll talk to her about something, whatever. But what you'll really be thinking is 'We had sex'.
I already did.
If she wants me, she can come to me.
Look at his face, he did the deed.
Look, why don't you just call Diane again?
Tell me, is it bad news?
Are you kidding?  You're not kidding?  You're not kidding!
Well, I don't think he's really been embarrassed by it.
I'm fine.
Do you wanna make things easier on me?  Now tell me where you were because this is, this is bullshit.  You can say anything to me, I hope you still know that.
You're going.
Bon voyage.
Dad, I love him.
Swear to god, I need to know the truth.
Honey!
I trusted you.  I stood up in court five years ago and I picked you.
Take it easy how mad you make me, I'm the only dad you've got.
Yeah.  I just wanted to congratulate you on your scholarship to England, and I wanted to tell you that I thought your speech was really incredible.
Yes, we sat together at Bell's Square.
Yeah, I have to help my father.
What about tonight then, are you going to that party at Valhere's?
Look Diane, I'm sorry, but I can't allow you to leave the country without going to Valhere's graduation party.  This gentleman, he's twenty-two, and he comes out of hiding once a year for this occasion, and he dresses up as the Lakeside rooster, and he,
No tips.  I won't give you any tips of any kind.
I'll go.
They're Bavarian Death style  pretzels.
Yeah.  I'm so glad we did this.
Yeah, but that's an old story, you don't want to hear it.
What?
You're a great date.  I've never really gone out with someone as basic as you.
No, I'm serious.
Come on.
Friends with potential.
Here are some blankets.  This is a good song, this is a really good song.
Your letter came yesterday.
It did?
How do you know what I'm going to say?
Okay, how much time do you need?  I mean, you know, I mean you'll be leaving in a little while, so that's answered some questions. 
We'll see.
Lloyd, we shared the most intimate thing two people can share.
No I didn't.
Is this because of your dad?
Did you talk to Corey?
You told your dad?
What do you want?
What?
Alright, personalised flight care from Corey.  Books, cassettes, magazines, anything?
Oh.  Okay then... Lloyd Dobler, 555-1342.
Spend as much time as possible with Diane before she leaves.
You mean like career?  Uh, I don't know.  I've, I've thought about this quite a bit sir, and I'd have to say considering what's waiting out there for me, I don't want to sell anything, buy anything or process anything as a career.  I don't want to sell anything bought or processed, or buy anything sold or processed, or... process anything sold, bought or processed, or repair anything sold, bought or processed, you know, as a career I don't want to do that.  So, uh, my father's in the army, he wants me to join, but I can't work for that corporation, so what I've been doing lately is kickboxing, which is really a, uh, new sport, but I think it's got a good future.  As far as career longevity goes, I don't really know, because, you know, you can't really tell.  Your training sticks  as a fighter, you know, but it's no good, you know, you have to be great, but I can't really tell if I'm great until I've had a couple of pro fights. But I haven't been knocked out yet.  I don't know, I can't figure it all out tonight sir, I'm going to hang with your daughter.
I know this part, keep reading.
So what's up?
You missed every one of your career counselling sessions.  Call me obsessive, compulsive, but let's do this right now.
How many people really know what they want though?  I mean, a lot of them think that they have to know, right? But inside, they don't really know, so, I don't know.  But I know that I don't know.
Yeah, hey, oh god.  Listen, I wanted to... I don't know you very well, you know, but I wanted to ask you, how did you get Diane Court to go out with you?
Yeah, but how come it worked?  I mean like, what are you?
This is great, this gives me hope.  Thanks.
Wow, man.  Well.  Listen man, I need you to be the keymaster.
Diane, everybody loves that you showed up.
I got a question.  If you guys know so much about women, how come you're here at like the Gas 'n' sip on a Saturday night completely alone, drinking beers, no women anywhere?
I'd love to, it'll have to wait until I get back.  I have to leave.
You're kidding.
Well, you've been through it.  You know. You could make things easier for me.
The guards aren't allowed on the factory floor. They make my workers nervous.
I asked for metal, you gave me glass.
Look it up.
I work hard for you.  I'll continue to work hard for you.
I mean where have you been? Nobody's seen you around for a while.
Whoever.  They're the ones.  They'd appreciate some kind of gesture from me.
I think most people right now have other priorities.
Any reason to think next month will be worse?
Christmas presents.
Are you losing money?
I'll admit it's a weakness.  I don't think he enjoys it.  All right, he does enjoy it, so what? What do you expect me to do about it?
More.
No?
Would it do any good?
Of course he's stealing from me, we're in business together.  What is this?  I'm sitting here, suddenly everybody's talking like this is something bad.  We take from each other, we take from the Army, everybody uses everybody, it works out, everybody's happy.
We're aware of that.
Who is this?
Who do you want to speak with? Nobody's here.
What if I said you?
You wrote me a letter. Very cordial. Very appropriate.
It helped me realize one thing.
What?
You have a right to be angry.
No, I don't.
Look, I know you kinda hold me up as your career template and it gives you some anal charge to challenge me but you win. Okay? I'm not interested in the scoop anymore. Excuse me.
Enter Cotton Weary.
I'll get my jacket.
Let us decide that.
Good question. You took the bait.
Aren't most serial killers seemingly harmless?
We have our own website now. We dedicated a whole page to you.
Weâ€™re hoping for the death penalty. I have this whole DEAD MAN WALKING swan song exit planned.
And now, drum roll please...
So we found a compromise.
Just for you, Sid.
Tuitionâ€™s expensive.
I've been trying to reach you but you haven't returned...
No, what you are is a money hungry, fame- seeking liar and--forgive me for saying-- mediocre writer who has a cold storage shed where her heart should be.
He's already gotta be a part of Sid's life. What do you know about this Derek?
A bloody knife. A ghost mask. Something like that?
That's not the way it's done.
Over here.
Humor me, Sid.
Watch your back.
Oh my God.
Stay under the safety light. Help is on its way.
No, girletta, I don't leave your side.
I'll stop by the Deltas tonight.
..we only promote safe rubbered sex.
..it's really about family and tradition...
Closer than you think.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry but I had to. It was too easy.
Listen to me. We've got to get help. The Killer's here.
What are you talking about?
Anytime. Sorry it sucked. It just had that been there done that feeling.
Asshole, Can't talk.
Maybe so, but right now, we play the game. First question, Your girlfriend's counting on you, Name your girlfriend's character in STAB 2?
Very good. Now we play ROUND 2.
I wish that was all Miss Weathers, but there's more. The killer left a note.
Oh. I thought you wanted me to stick around.
Hmm.
Oh yeah, how?
What Rielly?
There's someone here who wants to help.
The killer called her.
No.
Don't worry Sid I'd never leave you like that.
What so you can just exploit her again with another book? Sid doesn't need you Gale.
You mean OUR past as in Me and Sid. This has nothing to do with you Gale.
Again, I am the author of the definitive book on the Woodsboro murders.!  What about you?
What's wrong with just being Gale Weathers? I liked her!
Brace yourself, Gale, all of this is actually not About you.
I'm sorry, this is too good!
And who is that?
Jennifer?! Wait, where are you going off to?
You're not a detective.
Fuck!
Sid, this is detective Kincaid.
I work better alone.  Why don't you do some snooping around the set?
No point, I'm just gonna give Detective Kincaid a call.
Well it's a honor to be here amongst so many fans of the genre. And I must say that any of you worried that Jerry Rapp, or Tori or David not returning to complete the STAB trilogy, have no fear, Roman is here. Aided with my excellent cast of newcomers I believe we're going to pull off one of the best Stabs yet.
Dewey, what the hell is she rambling about now? What's wrong Jen, see yourself on one of those USA NETWORK winners you did and realize how badly you suck at acting?
Wait a second, whoa! Calm down! Number one there were five different versions of the script given out. Ben Damon was given a fake script because he was only being offered the role. It only had fragments of real scenes from the actual script. And what, I die in STAB 3?
I am Gale Weathers!
And as a sane person.  For you that must be quite a stretch.
Who's this.
I can't take it anymore. This Hollywood exploitation of the nightmare I lived has to be stopped. I did this to make you all repent for your sins, and now I'm pleased I've got my message across. Good-bye.
You're not happy with your part.
Why don't we just read the scene?  Candy, is that like candy cane or candy apple?
It is in my script.
No. You didn't kill my mother. Billy Loomis and Stu Macher did.
The question isn't who I am.  The question is, who's with me.
Go there.
WHERE?
It's good to see you again Sidney. I was growing real impatient. Go ahead. Explore. I'll catch up with you later.
Are you sure?
Well then the people you need to call are the police.
I was just asking. Why are you always at me?
I was hoping Sid and I could talk.
That's right and now that you're no longer a virgin. You gotta die -- those are the rules.
No, it's not.
And last night? Sidney said you crawled through her window last night too?
What are you doing here?
See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember?
You know that's not true.
Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.
So... I'm sorry. I've been a selfish shit and I'm sorry.
Gotta find me first, you pansy-assed Mama's boy.
Who is this?
I'm sorry. I guess I dialed the wrong number.
I'm getting ready to watch a video.
Uh-huh.
They'd never make it in time.
I'm getting scared.
That all depends on you.
Please go away! Leave us alone!
Well... uh... yes ma'am. For the time being.
No, not yet.
Deputy... good evening.
Mind if I join you?
Can I bring Kenny?
Nah... it's just this town's way of not taking me serious.
What about Gale Weathers? I sound like a meteorologist...
Hey, I saw that movie. True story, 'bout some killer in Texas.
Thanks, Dewey. But with my luck they'd cast Tori Spelling.
How is everything?
She's tough.
She's with my sister. Should I bring her in?
Hold off for now. Just stay close to her.
She'll be with her friends over at Stu Maker's tonight.
Watch her. Don't let on -- just keep your eyes out.
What is it? Where's Casey?
The phone's dead.
If I'm gonna blow this up -- I need hard proof.
But it's so much easier when we make it up.
What's the delay?
Forget it.
Has his story changed?
I like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.
Your front porch.
No you didn't.
And what would be your motive?
He came to make up.
Wanna another beer?
Hey, Stu? Didn't you use to date Casey?
No way.
Later.
He was there, Tatum.
It's alright. I'll get it.
You can't prove a rumor. That's why it's a rumor.
Well... you can only hear that Richard Gere-gerbil story so many times before you have to start believing it.
During foreplay, I sing the theme song to myself. "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." It's a real turn on.
For once, Stu, drop it.
So far it's all dead ends.  No credit history.  No employment history.  His bank account's only five years old and it started as cash.  We're even trying to trace his furniture, but for now all we know is he's independently wealth, well educated and totally insane.  We may never know how he got that way.
I can breathe withour pain now, so I guess I feel great.
We figure you need all the tools you can get to fix up that piece of shit you call a house.
I'll see you.
Where was the prostitute?  Where was she?
Okay...
I mean, at this point, what would it hurt if you told us a little about yourself?
You should be thanking me.
We would have gotten you eventually.
Sit back.
I'm here for the same reasons as you, I guess.  Or, at least, the same reasons you used to have for being here before... before you decided to... quit.
Not here.
Whoa, whoa... what?!
Can we talk about this in private?
I just have to say, I can't respect any man who's never seen "Green Acres."
Well, his body was found Monday night, okay?  But, get this... the office was closed all day Monday.  Which means, as long as the gluttony killing was done before the weekend, our killer could've gotten in here on Friday.  He could've spent all day Saturday with Gould, and all day Sunday.
For now, let's just consider the books as the murderer's inspiration. The books and sermons are about atonement for sin.  And, these murders have been like forced attrition.
Bear with me.
Oh, that's all.
I've seen the same.  I'm not the country hick you seem to think I am.
In this city, if all the skeletons came out of all the closets... if ever hidden body were to suddenly rise again, there'd be no more room for the living.
The fingerprints.
Sounds like he knew what he was talking about.
They pay cops for the inside scoop, and they pay well.
Sorry about that... I just...
And so what?
We had him.
Looking around... I've got a bad feeling these murders are his life's work.
You do your job...
You follow the law and do the best you can. It's all there.
Well, I have to tell you...  I think I've fallen in love with you.
I guess I won't be showing it to him then.
I don't know why I asked you to come.
I want to have children.  It's just...
When the patrolman came she was trying put his head back together.  She was crying too hard to say anything.
Yes.  Look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here.
This is a done deal.  All but the paperwork.
How should I know?
That old goat still creakin' around?...Whyn't someone bury him?
Well, that's seven we can score up to your brother, Ethan.
In that case, give the boys room...
Why?  You wanted for a crime, Ethan?
Amen!...Put an 'amen' to it!
There sure is! I'm going to tell you somethin'...I wasn't going to speak of it...But I'll tell you now. Did you notice them scalps strung on Scar's lance?  Did you see the third scalp from the point of the lance? Long... wavy hair...
God forbid...No, son, you flog on back and tell your pa where we're at...and where he's at...
Why Colonel Greenhill is Colonel Greenhill, sir...Commanding Officer, Fifth U.S. Cavalry...I'm Lieutenant Greenhill, sir.
Yes sir...We've received information about a band of Comanches under a chief named Scar...
Well...I know there were some captives recovered...
No...our turnin' back don't change anything...not in the long run. If she's alive, she's safe...for a while...They'll keep her to raise as one of their own, 'til she's of an age to...
An Injun will chase a thing til he thinks he's chased it enough...Then he quits...Same when he runs...Seems he never learns there's such a thing as a critter that might just keep comin' on...So we'll find them in the end, I promise you that...We'll find them just as sure as the turning of the earth.
YOUR cattle?...<U>DEBBIE'S</U> cattle!
Oh...
You all settled an' comfortable now?
He just couldn't wait...
Scar?
Think it might be...?
Oh no! Tell her she's got to go back...
I don't know...Somethin' tied his hands...maybe hospitality...
You can keep your will!  I ain't forgettin' you was all set to shoot her yourself...What kind o' man are you, anyway.
There's one thing. We recovered a bushel of trinkets in that camp... cheap stuff...trade goods...Couldn't help noticing that most of it was Mexican...Maybe if you could talk to some of those Mexican traders along the border...What do they call themselves?
I am...I am...It's just that I know Martha'd want you to think of her boys as well as her girls...And if the girls are...dead...Ethan, don't let the boys waste their lives in vengeance!
Yes!..Yes, I remember!..Have they found her, Ethan?
From the beginning...
'Dear Miss Laury'...He spells it with a Y instead of an I...E...Wouldn't you think he'd know...
You talk like a feller might just as leave run around nekkid...
You do and I'll die, Martie...I will! I'll just die!
You're not a doctor, you'll hurt him!
Oh God, Tommi...
Me and the muse, of course.  How is your book coming along?
Oh, that was upstairs.  A real antiquity!  I think it's great.
My father was an electrician. Already forgot that?
I just had a really strange experience.
Ellen, what are you trying to prove, anyway?  That we've created ourselves a ghost?  Come on!
Okay, so the house has a history and there might still be a couple of corpses in the moors.  "There is something negative about the place..."  What the hell are you trying to say?  Come on!  Spit it out!
Your book - that's why you were always in the cellar!
Wait, won't you join me for a cup of coffee?
I appreciate your concern, but we live in that house.  I need to know what happened in there.
What?
And you are a Warwickshire shit-house.
Writer, is he?
The title?
Put his feet in.
A share of the profits.
Mr. Fennyman, I think you may have hit on something.
Yes, but very well.
Aphrodite Baggot who does it behind the Dog and Trumpet?
Fifty pounds? What for?
By God, Will, if you do not, who does? Let us have pirates, clowns, and a happy ending, or we will send you back to Stratford to your wife!
I don't know, it's a mystery.
Good title.
"Ay me, sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?"
I will.
When the Queen commands it.
Fifty shillings.  Pounds.
"Go ask his name--If he be married, My grave is like to be my wedding bed."
You left it in my bed. Come to look for it again.
Burbage has my keeping but you have my heart.
But your voice  Have they dropped?
If they find you here they will kill you.
Moonlight!
There is time. It is still dark.
Oh, but it will end well for love?
I am aware of it, but it is beauty's privilege.
Your father should keep you better informed. He has bought me for you. He returns from his estates to see us married two weeks from Saturday.  You are allowed to show your pleasure.
Ah! My lady! The tide waits for no man, but I swear it would wait for you!
My hat?
Does she say so?
No. And yet she does where the ink has run with tears. Was she weeping when she gave you this?
What of her bosom?
Yes, by God! Love knows nothing of rank or riverbank! It will spark between a queen and the poor vagabond who plays the king, and their love should be minded by each, for love denied blights the soul we owe to God! So tell my lady, William Shakespeare waits for her in the garden!
I was a poet till now, but I have seen beauty that puts my poems at one with the talking ravens at the Tower.
By God, I'll fight the lot of you
I'd like to ask you about your hobbies.
It's asick idea, Alex. It's sick.
You know what. Who's going to do it.
Yes. Now come on, all or nothing.
You're sure? There's lots more.
Not eating what?
Looking for you? Yes.
I'm glad you're so certain, Alex. It makes us feel a whole lot better.
They know.
Yeah, I was phoning your mother.
Your idea? Well, that fits. I mean, the two of you, that fits together. I should have seen that long ago.
Well?
Are you recording it?
Yes, thanks.
Good. Well, you've seen the flat?
No. Be someone else like him. One is enough. And what happened to that girl, that friend of yours, the one that came round. I liked her. I really felt we had something. She could have moved in. We had chemistry.
Alex.
It was you, Juliet, it was you --
Know and love?
Why not? What's wrong, Juliet? Aren't you curious? Don't you wonder what he died from?
It's not for me. It's for love and happiness forever.
Don't know. No one said anything. ALEX Rendered speechless with desire. I recall that feeling, from the days when I had such a thing.
Yeah, you're making us all nervous.
Oh, good.
Where he can't get it?
Oh.
Well, I'm not expecting anyone either.
It's the only way.
As smart as you are, you'll need a little help.
Yeah, well, that's what she said. Interesting. That's why you're here, you see.
We understood there were four people living here. Not always, of course, but now, four.
Someone lost the key.
That wasn't a question.
Oh, yes, I'm fine, thanks, just fine.
Two hundred pounds?
Sorry?
Right here?
Eh --
Oh, him. Well, he died.
I see.
Writing seems easy.
It's an improvement.
No, just leave it. He knows I must be at home. I'm working nights this week.
Do you think you have a good memory for faces?
Like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
What're you talking about, George?
I'm thinking of investing with him. He worries me.
My keys.
Does she have a pancreatic ulcer?
Gee, that's very serious...
I don't want to see you anymore.
But you don't know what happened.
Jesus, I don't know, baby, I been cutting too much hair lately. I'm losing all my concepts...
Whatever you say.
And I certainly wouldn't tell Lester.
No, that's okay, I'll do It now.
Well she...
Nobody can hear it.
Hey, I tried to get her off the phone.
Like what?
Are you in love with her?
Don't worry, honey, I'll protect you.
God, I adore you.
No thanks.
Gee, this is great.
No shit.
Look...  Do you wanna fuck me?
How is she?
You do know what money's like these days.
I've got heads here, Norman.
Somebody's going to have to wash Mrs. Young. Mary's not here.
You are today.
-- Maybe she'll come with us. If I tell her how important it is to me, I don't think she'll mind. Do you?
I don't know. Probably not.
No, I'm sure.
She's incredible...  She loves you, George.
Do you? You still see him?
Yeah?
You did, didn't you?
Yeah, baby...
-- oh yeah... what do you know about this guy?
No you didn't.
-- yes, honey, you've got to get out of here.
Lester's left Felicia. He's taking me to Acapulco on the five o'clock flight. He's asked me to marry him.
Don't leave me...
No, man.
Don't talk like a child. You're a pro, now get out there and cut!
-- you shouldn't do me like that...
-- please, please forgive me...
Hey, stop by the shop.
What's gonna happen?
What?
You said somebody... who?
No shit?
Fine. How are you?
What?
Right now -- I'm at the epitome of my life. Right now I feel so good I'm afraid something's gonna happen.
Hey, baby, what's happening?
Okay, but how did it go at the bank?
No, but I think they might.
Just a second, I'll be right with you...
They didn't offer you the job yet.
Right now?
Maybe I should get a dog... no, it would just shit all over the house and I'd never clean it up.
Commercials.
Let go of me.
What difference does it make?
-- it'll help me if you'll tell me.
-- no, it'll help me, really --
... honest. At least you're honest with me.
Stop it.
What did you say?
But Mr. Norman said --
No, they're a pain in the ass, there's no way of keeping track of anything. It's a cash business and you've got to watch your operators or they'll steal you blind, am I right or am I right?
Oh yeah?
Your hair looks -- well fabulous.
All night.
Look, Lester... are you unhappy with me about something?
I'm not anti-Establishment.
Why, why do you think that is?
Have a drink.
What?
Yeah, the clap. That's what she thinks. But who knows -- I don't know.
No.
I told you I get 'scared up here, so if you're not coming right now...  I'm not kidding.

A soap?
A daytime soap opera.
What was it, somebody's daughter?
Somebody's mother.
-- well, more than anything else --  -- I'd like to suck his cock.
Is that right?
I am?
Of course not.
Really? How about starting with tonight?
No.
Glad to meet you, Jill, Mr. Pope.
Jill Haynes, Jill Haynes, I've told you about Jill a hundred times, Lester, you never remember anything I say.
Jesus, she's my best friend.
See you later.
Who is that?
Jill, I'm just trying to be helpful.
But you have problems?
Jackie --
-- uhh-huhh...
-- Well it was very hot so I'd left the door open and the water was running so I didn't hear him come down the stairs...
All right, forget this filth. Continue about your friend.
Good for you.
Well did he go in there with Jackie?
That's fine --
Thank you.
Thanks for coming by.
Okay.
What?
Are you sure?
Who says you ain't supposed to?
Try to think what it was.
You're scared of Room 237, ain'tcha?
Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?
Yeah, I guess so.  Anyway, there's hardly anybody to play with around here.
Yeah.
No.
Danny!
Do you remember when you were brushing your teeth?
To my stomach.
Yes sir.  Look um... I think the best thing is to come along to the gentlemen's room, sir, and eh...
Yes, sir.
Eh... Mr. Grady... weren't you once the caretaker here?
Thank you very much.  I'll do that.
All right, sir.
I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did.
Pleasure to meet you.
Now I'm awfully glad you asked me that, Lloyd, because I just happen to have two twenties and two tens right here in my wallet.  I was afraid they were going to be there until next April.  So here's what: you slip me a bottle of Bourbon, a glass and some ice.  You can do that, can't you, Lloyd?  You're not to busy, are you?
Yes.
Fine.  Why don't you start right now and get the fuck out of here, hmm?
It's okay.  It's okay, now.  Really.
Absolutely nothing.  How is he?
I can't really remember.
I just want to go back to my room.
Stay... stay away!
Jack, stay away from me!
Well, that just happens to be exactly what I'm looking for.  I'm eh... I'm outlining a new writing project, and eh... 
Not for me.
shut in together over long periods of time.
No, my son's discovered the games room.
Oh, I'll say.
Damn near. Now I'll sit up with this stupid gun in my lap because I promised, but you two are going to bed. Go on, now, scoot.
It was Brady's idea, Jane. Honest to God. Please take the money. I want to make up.
Will you marry me, Jane?
Will you?
That's what my sister says, too. Pretty soon I'm going to start checking the mirror to see if I'm turning green.
Rats...
Let the boy finish the game, Nan.
Don't call me dear boy.
Uh-huh. Only in her case I guess it would be Queen Shit of Turd Mountain. Hand me that adjustable.
What?
Do I need one?
No- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face.
I told you!
I saw what I saw.
I think he's going to come for me. Not just because I know who he is, but because I hurt him. Only I don't think he'll try again as Lowe.
What about crack?  You a user?
Hey, Sisters.  Are you going in there?
Mary Robert, don't panic.  Remember what we talked about?  Experience?
What?
Vince...
We can still see each other.  Just like always.  It's a different kind of sin. Smaller.
You pig!
Yes?
Sure.
I feel sorry for you, Vincent.  And I forgive you.
Yes, Betty?
HE'S SO FINE.
Why?
But don't you get money?  From the Vatican?
Oh, right.  At my old place, we used to... wash cars.  Groom dogs.  So... nice loom.
Mary Clarence, could you?  Mary Lazarus, you're terrific, but...  Could you help us?
No way.  We're a choir, right? Headliners.  The big room.  Two days a week won't cut it.  Every day.
Hopeless I
Sing!
I... I brought you something.
A cigarette?
An extra heel of bread.  Please take it, you need your strength.  You've been working so hard.
She says I should wait.  She says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life.  She says that I'm not experienced enough to make the decision yet.  In a mature manner.
Now you.
Give me a C.  A C!
We're nuns!
It's true!
Oh my God.  This isn't happening, tell me this isn't happening.  It's a nightmare, I'm back at St. Anne's!
Beats me!  What do you think?  Smoking! Heavy petting, without a chaperone. Heavy petting, with the chaperone.  And wearing a black bra, under my uniform.  The demon bra.
Are you talking about me?
Check your driver's license.
Like to who?
Your cell.  Your room.
It's like the Stone Age.  The room time forgot.  What about a phone?
From all I've heard, just about everything.  Your singing career seems all but nonexistent, and your married lover wants you dead. 
In English?
Look... I know I shouldn't have, I'm incredibly sorry about Mary Robert, I wasn't thinking, I didn't know that would happen!
What?
No.  No.
The council of Cardinals is perhaps the most esteemed body in the entire Catholic church.  They command the utmost respect. Your more... secular entertainment would be wholly out of place.
You have a phone call.
I have submitted my resignation to Bishop O'Hara.  Privately.  I have asked to be relocated as soon as possible.
Very well.  I hold you responsible for all of this, For introducing a lounge act into my convent.  For utterly disrupting our way of life.  And for placing all of us in mortal danger.  Thank-you.
What about me, Reverend Mother?  I think you were right.  I'm just a bad influence.  Sister show biz.
Perhaps not.  Perhaps we can all use... a little Spandex.
When are you gonna get off my case? Have you got a search warrant?  What do you want -- cheap thrills?
Screw you!
Okay -- no limo.
Calm down.  Look, I didn't want to tell you this, but we've had some problems with our protection program lately.
You son-of-a-bitch!
You blew it -- big time.  She doesn't want you back.
Does she know people are trying to kill me out there?
Go in and talk to her.  It can't hurt.  Go.
Listen to yourself.  This isn't a career opportunity.
You re sort of... radiant.   your eyes are shining.  You're rea1ly different...
Nuns?
Really.
Vince is getting desperate.  Where is she, Eddie?  Where'd you stash her?
You know so much.  They've got Christy, and we've got to find her.  Get her 8x10, from in front of the lounge.  Fax it to every contact we got.
Yeah, right -- when I see it.
Dress rehearsal at four, performance at 8:30.  Sharp.
Yes?
St. Katherine's is a Benedictine Order. You have taken a Vow of Hospitality.  To all in need.
Well, unless your name is Baltus, you should not worry over mine.
Two days... ?  For murder?
What is that?
You need rest.
What of it?
Yes, sir... but, do you have these?
A fine idea.
Master Hardenbrook...
He drowned.  Anyone could see.
Must we again hear these heretical rantings?
Even though I have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused, often quite literally?
Not for lack of trying.
Just so.  Granted.  And so you take your experimentations to Sleepy Hollow and catch the murderer who has tainted the place.  Bring him here to face our good justice. Will you do this for me?
I deserve to help you.  Don't you see how much this means?  My father... he... he was a good man...
I'm sure I don't know.
His teeth.  Someone had cut them and chipped off rotten pieces far back in his mouth.  The Lenape could not have done that for himself.  Someone out there cared for him.
Look again.
I have others.  All I need is this.
Then, who murdered the Old Crone?  And why?
Good questions, deserving answers, of which we are in short supply.
Man or woman?
Yes.
Intestate.  Your farm... all the farms... they belong to no one.
Baltus Van Tassel.
It is nothing.  She comes to read books, so her father will not find her.  It is absolutely nothing.
Things have become complicated. Katrina is at the mill.  Ride ahead, find her and bring her to meet me outside the church.  Find her at all costs.  Quickly.
My suitor?
Which may explain his temperament. To have asked twice means the answer was "no" at least once.
Extra ordinary, yes.  But first, you tell me about the Headless Horseman.
Are you so superstitious?
It would be interesting to find out.
Don't you see why?  Look closely a moment.  Put your intellect aside.  Can't you see what is inexplicable?
If these are the random stalkings of a monster, what good am I?
No stone may be left unturned.  It may appear harsh...
If it had been surgery on a living person, done to save that person's life, you would not question it.  Not for a moment.  So, let me be the first to tell you, dear girl... on the other side of these sheltering mountains, a whole world has advanced beyond such plebeian thinking as yours.  And someday, no matter how much you fear it, that world will come to roust Sleepy Hollow out of its slumber.
What troubles you?
She is not your birth mother, is she?
She died.  Her lungs were diseased... two years ago.  What is this about?
What did you say?
Yes, I have seen that, and I told you why I hid them.
Speak the words, Constable.  What is stopping you?  What has happened to your ability to transcend sentimentality?
Use caution.
As my husband says, a wife should be always like an echo, and at the same time, quite unlike an echo.  Like an echo, she should speak only when spoken to, and unlike an echo, should never try to have the last word, or, at least that is what he believes.
I didn't see none.
What did you say?
You do not want to be here.  Go home to your father.
Yeah, me too.
Well, I'm gonna pay you today for this comin' week, so you'll have some walkin' around money. When you get off this evenin' you better go buy some toothpaste and cleanin' up supplies to have back there. Some hard candy and some magazines. Somethin' to keep you busy at night.
Aw, pretty good. Kids are drivin' me crazy and Phyliss is gonna put me in the poorhouse. Can't complain other than that. Wouldn't do any good if I did.  Do you know Scooter, Jerry?
Karl, come over here. I want you to meet your new boss.  This is Bill Cox, runs this place. Says you can work here and stay in the back.
Catch you later Freddy!
You know what we ought to do tonight?
No Doyle. Vaughan don't want to come to a party with you.
Karl, you better clap your hands or he'll just keep on.
Leave.
It went real good.
I know Albert. We're friends.
I heard you was more than friends. I heard Dick Rivers caught y'all all bowed up and goin' at it in the same room with poor, little, old Mizz Ogletree and her dead as a doornail layed out on a gurney.
You're just crazy in a retarded kind of way then.  It wouldn't matter to me if you did do violence on somebody 'cause I ain't afraid of shit. You think I'm afraid for you to stay here. You're just a humped over retard it looks like to me. Not really, I'm just jokin' with you. Welcome to our humble home, buddy. Frank needs all the friends he can get. Frank's a real weak little kid. His daddy taught him how to be a pussy.
Pick up the fuckin' phone and call 'em, I guess.
Childers.
Why'd you live there?
You told me to come by.
Did you want to play ball with us?
He never did want to. I figure he ain't changed his mind much.
It ain't the truth. He shot hisself with a shotgun on purpose.
Yeah, I did.
It's okay if you're lookin' out for yourself. If it's self-defense. Was it self-defense?
Yeah.
I was wantin' to ask you somethin'.
Pull on your works. Your privates.
You ort not to pull on yourself that away.
Yes sir. Right then it was.
Bible says the same thing about killin' others, too.
Them boys was tryin' to pull me down pretty hard.
That feller's a whole sight meaner than me. He'd just whup the tar out of me.
Ever'thing's okay, boy. I kindly want to put my arm around ye for a minute and then I'm gonna go on and leave here.
I don't know. He just said he'd eat out there.
I guess. He went to the garage. Poor thing, he's probably never seen such a crazy mess. He probably wants to go back and live in Mr. Cox's shop.
Huh?
I stay on my feet all the time at work. I just can't find shoes that's comfortable.
I ain't got no boy.
You better go get 'em.
No, I mean your past. About why you were in here.  I'll take you first thing in the mornin'. You have anyplace you can stay tonight at all? I just can't let you stay here. It's the rules. If something happened well, I'd be liable.
Yes sir.
Do they know about you?
Karl, this is my boyfriend, Doyle. Frank, why don't you and Karl go out in the garage and fix him up a place or play a game or somethin'. Vaughan, you ready to go?
I'll be dog.
Right now?
Okay.
All right then.
Thank ye.  I'm just getting around to tellin' you, but I fixed your warshin' machine.
I's horned and raised here up till I's twelve year old.
I reckon Mr. Woolridge got me hired on to work for Bill Cox's outfit.
Homosexual. I like men. Sexually.
This evenin' I want you to go get Mizz Wheatley and that Frank and have them stay with you tonight.
I don't reckon you have to go with women to be a daddy to a boy.  You've been real square dealin' with me. The Bible says two men ort not lay together. But I'll bet you the Good Lord wouldn't send nobody like you to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades.  That boy lives inside of his own heart. Hits an awful big place. You take care of that boy.
No, we have to get this story.
Y'all have a seat. Is this all of you?
Well, yeah, it's for the school newspaper. But it has pictures. I mean it's a regular paper, you know.
Well, what do we do? We drove all the way out here.
That's really strange. What does it mean?
I hope the best for you, Miss Dwiggins, with your school and your paper and all.
Wonderful. When your next book is published, maybe you could come into the store and do a signing. I'm sure we could get a lot of people to show up.
Better make it charge. 
It's just a summer job. Something to help pay the bills while I finish my dissertation.
Visions of Utopia in Nineteenth-Century American Fiction.
Uh ... actually, it might be better if you read the story first. Call me when you're finished, okay?
It's simpler, that's what. It makes things go faster.
Definitely.  I suppose it all goes back to Queen Elizabeth.
I guess you could call it a hobby. It doesn't take me more than about five minutes a day to do it, but I do it every day. Rain or shine, sleet or snow. Sort of like the postman.  Sometimes it feels like my hobby is my real job, and my job is just a way to support my hobby.
It's kind of overwhelming.
You'll never get it if you don't slow down, my friend.
Help? Hmm. It's possible. What did you have in mind?
No, he's not. You are.
It's Tommy's. The sucker owed me a favor.
Uh, better make it one.
That's a feather in your cap, man. The paper of record.
Ready. Any time you are.
Yeah, probably.
I mean, it's a good story.
I don't want to talk about it.  If you really want to know. I lost it. And I'm not sorry I did. That eye was cursed, Auggie, and it never gave me nothing but grief.
And you think it looks better to go around dressed up like Captain Hook?
Don't rush me, okay? You're jumping to conclusions before I've even said anything.  And besides, it's not for me.  It's for our daughter.
I know what it means. That still don't make it a good name.
You weren't so lukewarm yourself. At least at first.
You don't give up, do you?
It was the only way, Auggie. Otherwise, she wasn't going to let me see her.
Look, I'm not saying you don't have a daughter. It's just that she's not my daughter.
And what's that supposed to mean?
She looks just like you.
I don't have much choice, do I? It's pretty clear she doesn't want me around.
Not if you got her into one of those rehab programs.
Are you calling me a liar? I'm telling you I'm broke. I don't even have insurance on my goddamned car.
I'm sorry, baby. I can't help it.
No problem, Vinnie. Everything's under control.  I could run this store in my sleep.
She made a play for me after I got back, but her glass eye kept interfering with my concentration. Every time we got into a clinch, I'd start thinking about that hole in her head, that empty socket with the glass eye in it. An eye that couldn't see, an eye that couldn't shed any tears. The minute I started thinking about it, Mr. Johnson would get all soft and small. And I can't see getting married if Mr. Johnson isn't going to be in tiptop shape.
Speaking of which, are you still going ahead with that deal on the Montecristos?
It's all set. My guy in Miami said he'd have them within the next few weeks.  Are you sure you don't want to go in with me? Five thousand dollars outlay, a guaranteed ten-thousand-dollar return. A consortium of Court Street lawyers and judges. They're just drooling to get their lips around some genuine Cuban cigars.
I've got to get moving. Terry will bust my chops if I'm late. See you in September, Auggie.
Come around to the cigar store tomorrow morning at ten o'clock and we'll talk about it, okay? We'll see what we can work out.
Huh?
Okay, Auggie, I got it. You don't have to yell.
It'll keep them fresh. If they get too dry, they'll break. And you don't want that to happen, do you?  Tobacco is a plant, and it needs the same loving care you'd give an orchid.
Damned if I know. But it has a nice ring to it, don't it?
I'm looking for my nephew,  Thomas.
You mean Rashid?
And his parents?
It's a free country, isn't it? As long as I'm not trespassing on your property. I can stay here till kingdom come.
Just passing through.
Five bucks! You mean you're going to charge me five bucks just to look at it?
What's your offer?
Benefits?
You named the kid after yourself, huh?
Help? What the fuck do I need your help for? I've got a man, don't I? That's more than you can say for yourself, Hawkeye.
Management. Those guys are walking around with their heads up their asses.
Jesus, Tommy, it ain't science, you know. You got your good trades and your bad trades. That's how it works.
I don't know, Tommy. You think anyone gives a rat's ass about Kuwait? I read something about the head sheik over there. He marries a different virgin every Friday and then divorces her on Monday. You think we want to have our kids dying for a guy like that?
So what's the time?
I can't believe I did that ... Christ. I'm walking around in a fog ...
No, wait. You can't just walk off.  You saved my life.
Well, maybe just one. To be polite.
That's true. But I also owe you something, and I'm not sure that buying you a hamburger is going to do the job.  What is it? Family problems? Money problems?
Uh-huh. One of those cozy bed and breakfast places, probably.
Yeah, that's right.
I used to have one, but it broke a couple of years ago and I never got around to replacing it.  I'd just as soon not have one anyway. I hate those damn things.
But then you don't get to watch the ball games. You told me you were a Mets fan.
How long have you been here?
That's because we don't belong anywhere. You don't fit into your world, and I don't fit into mine. We're the outcasts of the universe.
Fair enough. We wouldn't want to get carried away, would we?  Now call your aunt Em and let her know you're alive.
Once a story gets hold of you, it's hard to let go.  Besides, I'm making up for lost time.
Just so you don't overdo it. You don't want to die of sleep deprivation before you finish.
Yeah, right. The inspiration. It's a true story anyway, so I don't suppose it can hurt, can it?
I just did.
Pick two or three. Now that the coffers are open, you might as well take advantage of me.
And started to run.
And started to run.
That's just it. I didn't think. I just did it.
Six thousand dollars. Five thousand eight hundred and fourteen dollars, to be exact.
That's it. In a nutshell.
Well?
It wasn't my fault.
Wow. They sure did a job on you.
Do you have real iced coffee, or do you just pour hot coffee over some ice cubes?
Everything is real in here, honey.  As real as the color of my hair.
You want another one of these, too?
That's obvious.
No bits of bone, no particles of scalp, no strands of hair?
None.
Did he see some <u>danger</u> from defen...
Your husband returned at, what, seven o'clock?
Of course not.  We're just not quick to run and boast.  In case something went wrong.
But if truth was on your side, whatever were you worried about?
Well, it seems to me...
Look at my face.  It's the face of the people who did that.  My father hardly speaks English.  We're in bad trouble, you have to see that.
I did.  But the jury won't s...
From Carl Heine's boat.  All his were like this one, three-strand manila, new condition, braided in loops.  Not bowlined like Miyamoto's.
You bet.  And if Miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off, he coulda left this line behind on Carl's boat.
And replaced it later with the new one.  That's your inference?
Oh, yes.
That's curious.  I was <u>appealing</u> to their intelligence.
Oh, yeh.  But this is nine year ago, I had my healt, I wasn't wantin' to sell.
Carl Heine came.
Have a look.  At nothing.
Because the second lantern, the one on the mast.  Was never found.  So we have to ask...
He figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there.  So he climbs up.  To cut it down.
Maybe Carl picks up something about the freighter on his radio, which is now working.  Same report Milholland heard.  And <u>that</u> makes him get the lantern fast.  Before the freighter's wake can bang it around.
But you <u>could</u> be wrong.  He <u>could</u> have climbed up earlier.
I'll take two.  One for later.
Naw, I had that around for a while.
You mean, do I like to take the offensive?  Or hang back and wait.
Right.  In the middle.  Of the floor.
Does it now?
A little.  Yes.  You have to wonder.
But he had a spare D-6, you said. Right there.  Why not use that?
<u>You</u> said that.  That was <u>your</u> testimony.
Yes, you can tell me about the minor cut you found on the deceased's right hand.  The report says 'recent origin'.  How recent?  As much as 24 hours before death?
I...see.  I'm not sure I quite get your...point...
Spirit?                          Oh!  You mean "AQ"..."aggressive qualities"?
Yes.  And that one, too.
Bye.
Because I'm working the night shift - and I got a bottle of gin stashed away - and as soon as there's a lull -
I don't know - but I can feel it right here.  That's one good thing about ulcers - it's like a burglar alarm going off inside you.
They wouldn't be caught dead in Chicago - so we'll finish the job here.  Come on.
You're right, Joe.
Of course I am.
But suppose he loses?
Quiet - I'm thinking.
Shut up, will you?  I wonder how much Sam the Bookie will give up for our overcoats?
Don't you remember?  He has this bad tooth - it got impacted - the whole jaw swole up -
It did?  Boy, did it ever!
Yeah, that's what he means. Good old Nellie!  I ought to wring her neck!
With those legs?  Are you crazy?
What are you afraid of?  Nobody's asking you to have a baby.  This is just to get out of town. The minute we hit Florida, we'll blow this set-up.
Down, Daphne!
Then pull the emergency brake!
You wouldn't hit a girl, would you?
I got pinched in the elevator.
Well, now you know how the other half lives.
Blow where?
All right, all right!  But how long can we keep this up?
Daphne, you're bothering us.
What message?  What motorboat?
Oh, he does!
That's right.
Why do I let you talk me into these things? Why?
Have I got things to tell you!
What happened?
Then we'll get a quick annulment - he'll make a nice settlement on me - I'll have those alimony checks coming in every month -
Daphne got a proposal tonight.
There's our shaving stuff - and there's Sugar.
I may throw up.
What do you mean, your bracelet? It's our bracelet.
No.  It's nice and cozy.
And you've got cold feet.
Let me warm them a little.  There - isn't that better?
What did you say?
Maybe I'd better go before I catch something.
Just a little trick I picked up in the elevator.
I mean, your shoulders - and your arms -
Oh yes, we do!
No, no, Sugar - wait.  I have a feeling she's going to show up any minute.
I hope so.
Of course not.  As a matter of fact, it was just the other way around.  You see he needs help.
That's what I call a louse!  If I were you, Sugar, I'd throw that bracelet right back in his face.
This is our manager, Mr. Bienstock. I'm Sweet Sue.
Oh - those.  I don't know.  Mice?
I thought you said three years.
What's the big idea?
We could dye our hair.
- and you got to be girls.
Look, if William Morris doesn't come through -
Me too.  Bye now.
Let me carry one of the instruments.
I'm not surprised.
Bull fiddle.
You're a pretty hot little firecracker yourself.
Flower girl.
Well, to begin with, I'm not a natural blonde.
But you don't understand!  I'm a MAN!
Well, it is to me.  Will you give her a message?  I'd like her to have a little supper with me on my yacht after the show tonight.
To Urbana.  It's a hundred miles.
Nellie baby, I'll make it up to you.
Because I got some plans -
And you'll be in all evening?
You need a bass and a sax, don't you?
Me?
I'll say.
You can't trust those guys.
That so?
You know - I play tenor sax.
You don't say?
You are?
I want mine to wear glasses.
Search me.  I mean - I'll see.
What else?  And was I ever crazy about him. Two in the morning, he sent me down for knackwurst and potato salad - they were out of potato salad, so I brought coleslaw - so he threw it right in my face.
I wish you'd make sure.
Not very likely.
- Inauguration balls -
And you will come to hear us tonight?
They repealed Prohibition?
It's not how long it takes - it's who's taking you.
Well, that depends - on whether you're coming or going - I mean, normally the aft is on the other side of the stern - and that's the bridge - so you can get from one side of the boat to the other - how about a glass of champagne?
Yes - now let's see - where do you suppose the steward set it up?
A herring?  Isn't it amazing how they get those big fish into those little glass jars?
They shrink when they're marinated.
You mean we're alone on the boat?
Have I?  I'm trying all the time.
What else is there for me? 
My family did everything they could - hired the most beautiful French upstairs maids - got a special tutor to read me all the books that were banned in Boston - imported a whole troupe of Balinese dancers with bells on their ankles and those long fingernails - what a waste of money!
Why?
Thanks just the same.
I may not be Dr. Freud or a Mayo Brother or one of those French upstairs girls - but could I take another crack at it?
Did you have a nice time?
A merger?  How long will you be gone?
You're not?
According to our tax advisers, she's only so-so.  But - that's the way the oil gushes. A man in my position has a certain responsibility to the stockholders - all those little people who invest their life savings -
That's right - pour it on.  Talk me out of it.
Who's going to raid a funeral?
You and who else?
Refresh my memory.
What is it, Spats?  What do you want here?
You don't owe me no nothing.
Did Amy tell you she keeps her Homecoming tiara by the bed?
To make sure youâ€™re okay.
It was just after we moved here. My little girls got in a fight over Tony Pee-Pants and they havenâ€™t made up since.
Thereâ€™s a reason I always tell that Tony Pee-Pants story, you know.
No, thatâ€™s not it.
Shrink, actually.
You Yanks and your therapy. Itâ€™s great.  Itâ€™s all a bit too touchy-feely for me.
Kat, we must talk. This guy, thereâ€™s something not quite right.
Is that why you brought him? Because of me.
Um, news flash: I donâ€™t give a shit.
Well, we had a lot of good years, but then...
This happened to you?
Of course not. How...how could it be? Nothing happened.
Yup. Thatâ€™s why you get to keep your money.
You paid me for a lot of reasons. Closure wasnâ€™t one of them.
Youâ€™ve always got that to hide behind, donâ€™t you? Itâ€™s just business!
I wasnâ€™t saving you from him. I was saving you from yourself.
I havenâ€™t thought about that in years.
Hard.
At least somebodyâ€™s using the damn thing.  I was gonna fix her up but we took one trip and the kids fought so much, we never launched her again.
--and The ass of The man who adores her.
I don't live far from here. You and your dog can come home with me and have yourself a hot meal and then we'll talk about how to get you back home.
I try...
What he talk 'bout?
But where is my daddy!?
She was dirty and wet...
He'll show up one day.
Goodnight to you, son...
They gone to the field...
You won't be goin' to jail again, will you, Daddy?
Sunday...
Do you know my daddy, Nathan Lee Morgan?
Children, come here...
I think maybe he was scraped on the head by that shot. I don't think he's dead -- just gone somewhere to heal himself.
Listen, Mama...
But you'll be away from home for days -- what will you do when the dark comes, where will you sleep? I can't send you away from here like that!
Didn't see 'im, Mama. The other men there say they didn't know Daddy.
I'm used to it.
I brought these walnuts to trade.
I wanta get some things.
Yeah. I feel real up to it right now. Come on, David Lee, you and me'll do the loading.
But, Nathan--
You gotta low-life job, mister sheriff!
Now go, your friends are in danger... The USO show is a mile east of here, just over that ridge. The clitoris has spoken.
Can I finish? Please? Can I finish? ... ... Uh... Okay, I'm finished.
My head hurts.
Montana.
OW!! YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME!! THIS ISN'T FAIR!!! YOU SONS A BITCHE--
I hate the environment.
That book wasn't Canadian!
We're going... Let's run through the plan!!
You MUST shut off the power, this is VERY IMPORTANT do you understa-
You can't do this!! Have you ever HAD Cheesy Poofs? They're a taste sensation with a delightful cheddar crunch.
And she's getting worse...
We're not gonna have pie and punch!
pie and punch... This is Top Secret. The password is...
Yes, hon?
Mkay, kids from all over the State have been brought here, because you all share the same problem. Uh, young man... Let's start with you.
Then move out of the way.
Oh, you want out of hell, huh?
America... She iz a beetch that sheets on her own children.
Kay.
Did you shut the alarm off, Cartman?
Sweet.
Yeah, but you know, I learned something today.  I learned that getting all worked up over fuck and shit and cockmaster is just stupid... You all focused so hard on erasing profanity that you forgot the most important thing... To love each other.
No, it was worse than that...
The F word?!
It says 'Dear Terrance, please don't ever tell my son that I licked your hairy balls.'
<b>Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!! You're an asslicking, Ball sucking Unclefucka!! You're an Unclefucka, yes it's true Nobody fucks Uncles quite like you-</b>
I sure did, Phillip!!
Hello, Brooke Shields!
I know, Terrance. I know.
You did? Just now?
Do you always think about sex?  I'm talking about some very important stuff here!
Come on guy, you know I only rib you because I love you so much!
Listen guy, you're embarassing me in front of my friends!  You know how I get mad when I get embarassed.
<u>WHAT?!</u>
My friend the clitoris told me.
Dude, you didn't say anything about watches.
And the butfor?
They're not going to make it!
Koros, as in...Koros?  Dimitri Koros?
Well a little business too.  In my upcoming project Star Trackers I play a ship's captain, and I really wanted to get a feel for the outer space experience.  I feel it will add more credibility to my performance.
I'm sure I will.
I was there.  Officer Taylor accessed my CPU directly to open the airlock doors.  They are not functioning properly.
They are awaiting further information.
Well you did the right thing Mac.
Ain't it the truth. The two say nothing for a beat -
Well that hotel begins construction in January, there's going to be a lot of shuttle work.
Thank you.
No.  I'm all set.  Thanks.
That's very professional sounding of you, Taylor.
Why yes Ryan, I am, and thanks for asking.  You don't have to talk to the intercom, I can hear you fine.
I know, I know.
Well blaze your ass out of there! You've completely altered your trajectory, are we linking up or not?!
Don't worry about me, I'm changing coordinates now.  I've come to far to be tripped up by some Dudley do-right... motherfuckers!
No.  But it buys a lot of other things.
I don't have a problem with it. Besides, you get to meet a lot of interesting people.
Well maybe there's a way out of here.
Can't we access the mainframe to check the ship's condition?
Sure. It complies with all standard construction codes.
I don't know the condition of the compartments.  Depending on damage, debris...could be a fatal mistake.
You're right.
I understand.
Yeah?
Words to live by.
A schematic of the ship.  Looking for a lifeline to the pods.
There's only room on that pod for seven.  That's you and the others.  I'm counting on you to get them out of there.
Barnes?
So what's going to happen to you?
Sooner than later.
We have room!  Let's go!
Are you nuts!  It's too risky!
We should have gone to Nassau. At least we could go swimming, lie on the beach.
Yeah but the ship's mainframe doesn't. I need you to tell it something.
Alteration of my central processing unit should be done only by an authorized service dealer.
One moment please...  one moment please...
He's my dad.
No, pinhead, he ain't here to bowl.
We're looking for Buzz Fazeli, seen him?
Sheila, meet...uh...  I forget the name.
I got a right. You're my father.
You wish!
Look, kid, gimme a break. I'm an old man.  I'm runnin' on a Delrin aorta. I'm finished - dead from my ankles up.
I'm goin' straight. No more short cuts. Theo gets into the car. Buzz leans in the open window.
Theodore? Where are you? Are you alright?
I'll tell you one thing, you won't see me around that alley with that freak on the loose. Stay away from his ass - and don't play any of his fuckin' knock-knock jokes.
He told me to play Blue-Face with Buzz. I like games.
What did you do to Buzz?
You made me hurt him!
It's not an "Alley". I hate when people call it a "Bowling Alley", it's so common! I prefer "Bowling Center".
You might say I'm at the top of their shit list.
Maybe I can help you.  Try a lighter ball, Penelope - you'll get hurt with that big ball, honey.  I've seen tapes of you bowling on the circuit. You got Fazeli blood running through you. Your pop was a genuine talent in his day.
What's with the bad air between you two, Mr. Kastle?
It's nothing, just a slight business imbalance.  How's Gloria's thumb?
Nice set-up.
Why would you help me?
I think Buzz is retiring soon. In fact, I think he's retiring tonight. Kastle pulls out a shiny gold credit card and holds it in front of Sheila.
She ran away to be with that...  that Motocross champion.
You still got the touch Junior.
You keep that up Carmelita and one day you'll be a champion just like Mr. Skinner here. What do you think, Theo? Think Carmelita's got the stuff?
I'm a bowler.
Coming right up.
Won't your father help you with that?
What does he do?
It's a vicious cycle.
Can I ask you something personal?
Do you have a girlfriend?
Nothing.
It's been awhile. She didn't want me looking for my dad.
Yeah, but they're all little wannabes. I'm looking for a professional man.
Come on, bargain with me.
Nope, I couldn't care less.
Why should I help that old fuck.
Why not?
He's my father.
Are you sure he's dead?
I think your brother may have already gotten to Buzz. He gets into his car.
If Junior finds us, he'll kill us both.
I'm not dumping you, I'm suspending you.
Can you change something this big?
Back away then.
Would you wait a minute?
What are you -- his mother?  Get Norman, I want everyone ready to go.  Edmunds, the subs?
Edmunds, do you have a 20 on Norman?
What if it attacks?
Thirty yards.
He's right beneath us.
That's our reserve air.
A thousand feet.
The one you recommended.  In the ULF report you wrote for the Bush administration.
Or maybe, it can't <u>be</u> killed.
I don't know.  That's the point.
All I'm saying is, someone should keep an eye on him.
She should've known better.
At least our obituaries will be accurate.  That's reassuring.
Bullshit.  What's out there isn't alien.  It's an animal.
Maybe so.  But I think we need to ask Jerry about it.
To conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere.
A break for what?
Ladies and Gentlemen...
She wired this system.
What are you going to do -- shoot her?
Considered what?  That it's American? How would you think it's American?
I spent a week reading Sagan and watching re-runs of the Twilight Zone.  Seriously.  I was just trying to pay the mortgage on my house -- I had no idea --
C'mon, Beth -- that report's like the blind leading the blind.
Eggs.
Don't tell me to calm down!
You bastard.
Don't bother me, Norman.
Wait a second --
You think, in the sphere --
It's his fear.  The squid.  He's manifesting his fears.  Making them real.
Must be.  And if it is -- it's a part of him not even he can control.
Sintag.
Bingo.
"... and may also cause bizarre halucinations".
Damn it!  Chloramphenicol?
What?  Wait -- isn't that dangerous?
Thirty years ago.  In residency.  I passed out.  You?
For what?
In the sub.  Resetting the timer. Why?
Am I afraid of them?  Not during the day.  Sea snakes are diurnal.  When the sun's out, they don't bite. Fortunately for you, I had on my watch.  This is quite good.
If I was, then I would've had to have gone in the sphere, wouldn't I?
You're lying --
But --
That's bullshit.
I promise --
I'm a woman.  I don't theorize.  I only deal with facts.
For who?  The fish?
That's a hell of a mistake to make, Beth.
Like what?  I'm not --
Is it coming from our own computer?
Don't be defensive.
Not a clue.
On that flight recorder, they called the black hole an "Unknown Entry Event." They didn't know what a black hole was.  Fifty years from now, men are going to build that ship in a very tentative, experimental way, with no knowledge that time travel through a black hole is possible.
Meaning we're never gonna get the chance to tell anyone.
Look -- we're under a lot of pressure, we're tired, you're not thinking straight.
Tell me about the door.  Do you remember how you opened the door to the sphere?... Harry?
What is it, Harry?
You said something to me, before -- about how we were all going to die.
You don't remember that?
You're clear.  You see the airlock?
I was just in the cafeteria, there's plenty of food in there.  Take a look for yourself.
How do we decode it?
Unless, this alien spacecraft was -- you know -- somehow presenting itself to Americans in a way that would make us feel comfortable.
Meaning it didn't land in the water.
Codes are for <u>hiding</u> information.  So it's making a mistake.  It's making a code without intending to.  I figured it's probably substituting numbers for letters...  Then I began to wonder what an alien intelligence would make of our keyboard.  And since we're getting spirals, I imagined the keyboard as a spiral.  So I translated it...
The ships?
Just that.  Careful, it's heavy.
Take a look.  I rearranged the numbers.  Put 'em up to the light.  Go ahead.  Squint at it.
Please, Ted.
This is like nursery school.
Barnes didn't know.  Couldn't get a reading.
There's nothing on the news about a crash.  Did he say what airline?
Well, I can't imagine five years of unemployment --
Their bases are very well hidden. All the power of the Empire can't find them... Do you know where they are?
I think there are some things we should talk about.
Not bad.
Is that good or bad?
You could put it that way.
But you're still a powerful Jedi. You don't need my help.
I had one, but it was taken at the battle of Condawn...
Yes.  It was a black day.  One of my disciple's took the crystal and became a Sith Lord.  It was a black day.  The few crystals that remain are in the possession of the Sith Lords on Alderaan.  That's how they've become so powerful.
They use the Bogan Force.
There are two halves of the Force of Others.  One is positive and will help you if you learn how to use it.  But the others half will kill you if you aren't careful.  This negative side of the Force is called the Bogan, which is where the expression came from, and it is the part that is used by the Dark Lords to destroy their opponents.  Both halves are always present.  The Force is on your right, the Bogan is on your left.  The Kiber Crystal can amplify either one.  The Crystal Darth stole was the last one in the possession of the Jedi.  When he joined the Sith, the power of the Dark Lords was completed.
I rarely use it any more.  I have the Force.  The Force is more powerful than any pistol.  You shouldn't put too much faith in that weapon.  Work on becoming aware of the Force... learn to feel its presence within you.  Try to sense what it's telling you.  It's the only thing you can rely on.
You mean we should go after her!...
Stop thinking, and start feeling. Let yourself go.
I don't get it, but I guess I did block it.
I'm not going alone!
It's automatic.
Good!  I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.
Thanks, old buddy.  I'll be with you in a second.
It would be much easier if you were to tell us where the outposts are... Otherwise we'll be forced to destroy every suspicious system... What a waste...
There'll be time for that later. Now let's get out of here.
He'll be well cared for.
I said we'd see.  And as it is, I was forced to borrow your academy savings to buy the new 'droids.'  When you've saved it up again, I'll let you go.
Tell me where you've been.  I am going to become a startrooper and fight in the wars.  My father was a Jedi!  Were you in many battles?
I know, sir, but it's the principle of the thing.
You're back.  What happened?  Never mind.  What's going on?
I'm afraid we're not plugged in at the moment, sir.  We've had some problems.
For the moment.  We're in the main hangar.  Artoo is trying to plug into the system now.
Threepio!  Shut down all garbage mashers on your level... Do you copy?? Threepio, shut down all garbage...
I'd consider it an honor.
What an honor...
It's what I deserve.
Whad'ya talkin  about ?
Death to all bugs !
Got it. Fleet tactical wants to know where they can deploy the skimmers.
I hear they need a new Lieutenant... Want the job ?
I can't... but like I told you, it's a number's game. The Federation needs all the pilots it can get...
Don't you have to finish the game ?
Maybe not. I heard about this crazy girl coming through the academy, solid math, a little wild on the stick, but a natural. When it turned out it was you, I made sure we'd run into each other...
They revoke our flight status.
Three weeks aboard a starship and you know it all, huh ?
You and me, huh ?
Funny...
It wasn't luck. Rico ignored the mission objective to rescue you...
Just giving you something to remember me by, baby.
Sometimes I do what I want, eh ?
What are you talking about ? We both know you're gonna be a pilot.
I don't even know if you're my girl.
Shhh...
I'm glad you're doing so well. If they haven't made you squad leader by now, I'm sure you will.
What do you think ? Everyone did it when we got our wings. You don't like it, do you ?
It's alright, I guess. You hear from anyone made it out of B.A. alive ?
Johnny... Life is so different from the way it was. One day you'll see what I did was best for both of us.
We gotta choke on the mud and the blood and Fleet can't be bothered to spit.
What happened to your eye ?
I like it. It's kinda...you.
Take the number one chair, Ibanez. Follow all instructions of you supervisor.
Too bad for her if she's not around.
I don't stay where I'm not wanted.
Nah, I don't do that anymore...
It's alright 'cause I got to have you, Johnny...
Who gave you this idea ? It's that teacher. What's his name ? You know the one I mean.
Looks like rain.
Sounds more like some idiot at Military Intelligence Command wants to get me and my cap troopers killed...
My job is to protect the lives of my soldiers so they can kill bugs, Major, and if you're walking me into a trap-
Courage, I guess.
Hi, mom.
Hey, just calm down, I'm giving the orders here-
This is my farm. Now c'mon, give me what you got and get out of here...
Landing zone is extremely hostile. Come down on this transmission !
More data concerning this functioning is necessary before carbon units can be patterned for data storage.
That is how V'ger will survive.
'To learn all that is learnable.'
Have a security team meet me at Deck Four main elevator!
Thank you, sir. I'm sorry I embar- rassed you.
I'm afraid our hand is pretty weak, Captain.  But it's the only game in town.
Enterprise, I want that signal again. Transmit!
We have just seen that its body duplicates our navigator in <U>precise</U> detail. Suppose that beneath its programming, the real Ilia's memory patterns are duplicated with equal precision.
It seems we <U>all</U> imagine God in our own image.
My oath of celibacy is on record Captain. May I assume my duties?
Twelve seconds...!
Aye, sir.
We're already two settings below that, sir.
Hold relative position here...
Viewer ahead, sir.
And whatever you sensed out here....
... is my only hope of accomplishing what the Masters could not.
Delay that order, Scotty...! Disengage all main drive systems!
And these 'sensor-swarms' collect that data, carry it here.
No meaning... No hope...  And, Jim, no answers...! Jim, it's looking for <U>answers</U> <U>itself</U>!
What answers?
Yes, Captain, a child: evolving into adulthood -- learning, searching -- instinctively needing.
Yes, Captain. It needed our mortality, the fear of it, our struggle against it, our fears, our dreams...
Captain Decker requested I complete final Science briefing here before...
Twelve! I'm on my way to a meeting with Admiral Nogura which will not last more than three minutes. Report to me on the Enterprise in one hour.
That object out there is less than two days from Earth, Mister Scott. We've got to intercept while it still is out there!
Aye, we understand that sir! We're doing our best.
You bringing your new friend?
What's it called?
It's in your play.
Could you tell me when's the next train?
That, he says, there <u>are</u> no second chances...that he's been presented what he <u>prayed</u> for...and: he's ruined it.
You'd know better'n me.
I <u>can</u>?
Cast stood me up.
Never saw the point of 'em.
Fix my glasses.
Better'n new, cause it's got a <u>story</u>. Want to do the other part?
"To the love of my life, Love, Doug"?
Then I'll come back, then.
No, I just broke up with him.  I'll see you tomorrow.
Do you truly believe the electoral process is absurd?
I used to go out with a politician.
I hurt you?
...yes.
Where you going?
We could live up here, live up in the country.
...and we could get up every morning...
Carla was in the car, right?
I'm going to tell the truth.
Yes, that's right.
We had a date.
We did...?
Where have you been, we had a date for <u>three</u>...where have you <u>been</u>...?
Wai...It's so serious you couldn't call to tell me you'd be...what...?  What did you say...?
Who is this person that you've found?
That a fact.  Now, is it a good play?
You doin' here, Doug, thought you started out the day with that pernicious <u>caffeine</u>...
Town ain't got no courthouse.
Well, get him something else and let's get out of here in one piece.  Get him a half of a 28-year old girl.
That's right.
...overcome by the events around her, the presence of a high-powered...
What'll I do for fun?
How'd you like working with Richard Hill?
I'm having dinner with W...
But, that's the way of the world, huh? Everybody's gotta eat.  Way of the world.
You want to see it better, we could go out on the roof.
...wouldn't that be dangerous?
I swear that that woman in my room...
And you go start with <u>that</u> stuff in <u>this</u> town...
Well.  What seems to be the...?
...I have to give you this <u>ticket</u> for damage to city property.  I'm really sorry, Sir, it's a formality, I hope you'll excuse...
You have to what?
Scene <u>twelve</u>...arrival at the mill.
We know that you weren't.
Cool it, Babe, you started this...
I love Jewish men.
<u>You</u> know...Where's your bathroom?
Look, look there's someone else...
Don't let me dis...I'll just...
Yes, yes, but...
It isn't <u>right</u>.  I can't...I...I know I si...I, they, I don't know if they told me it was in the con...
...they treat me like a <u>child</u>.  I, I...to bare my <u>body</u>.
...and my heart goes out to you, because I know...
I'm only trying to...
The minute I read that script I said...
...she works with <u>animals</u>, she...
He's staying here?  Bob Barrenger is staying he...?
Why not?
You said <u>three</u>...?
...a history of <u>nothing</u>, he was acquitted...
No.  No, but we're planning to.
I had a witness I would.
...totally false...<u>totally</u> false.  He is the, I would say the most responsible human being I have ever...
Oh, that's <u>great</u>.  Let's bring more people into this overcrowded world.
I can't write it.  I lost my typewriter.
...that's just so <u>narrow</u>...
I didn't say anything to them.
Well, then, you didn't see it, right...?
What glasses were you wearing?  Were you wearing your reading glasses...?
It's lovely.
<u>Find</u> it.
If you do the product placement...
He just saved us eight hundred thousand bucks.
That we could use you in and I think that's quite a fine trade-off all around and an ill wind that blows somebody good.
I am so glad to meet you.  We are so glad to <u>have</u> you here, and <u>welcome</u> you to our...I, you know, they had c...I'm, <u>yearly</u> I redecorate our, to restore it to the, 1835...
<u>Whatever</u> you need.  The City Council, of course, has to pass on your...
...the city council...
So we just got lucky.
Then I can't do this shot...you wants me to push in--I can't push in through the window...We go back to New Hampshire?
I don't want that to happen.  Why would I want that to happen?
I'm not upset.  Why would I be upset?
Not with my mouth open.
Mom?  What's wrong?
Yes.
Here.
This is my daddy's house --
And this is my room so get out!
...laughed, yeh.  They laughed real hard.
He'll be impressed.  The clincher is, you <u>walk</u> away, then <u>whip</u> around...
Then have a donut --
No.
Doo-wop-doo-doo, <u>doo</u>-wop-doo-doo...
I noticed a whopping pile of laundry sitting on the washer -- perhaps Rachel's underpants are in there -- Now where are your lunches?
Seven of clubs.  Nobody's mad we just want to talk about it.
Does Rachel make a lot of money?
Honey, this is Thursday.  I pick you up tomorrow, and we do <u>big</u> spaghetti.
Is your bad?
No!  I have to get there.
Where Ben?
Before you.
I helped.
Always.  Always.  And you won't hear a voice.  But in <u>here</u>.  You'll know.  What I'm saying.
You've got a fruit loop in your hair.
At first.  Then, after awhile, some chemo.
It's Wednesday night.  She's at my house.  I'll talk to her.
Jackie stop.  We promised we never go there.
A lot smaller.
What is this?  The Betty Ford Center?
Maybe you could back off just a little bit --
No.  I thought it might be uncomfortable for her --
I'm sorry.  Look, I'm not real comfortable being here, but...
Ben likes to be read to.  Do you know Dr. Seuss...?
Hey.  At least it's not an editing machine.
Yes?
Don't flatter yourself.
She was afraid you'd make a big deal out of it.
She's devastated.
It's a mess, right now.  That's my project when I get back.
You look sick.  But you look... together.  Mentally tough.
And you said...
Yeh, she's...I'll get you Ben first, it's past his bedti...
He looks familiar.  Did he do a Calvin Klein ad?
You are <u>defending</u> what you did?
You had her <u>lie</u> about that... that fancy-boy <u>model</u>!
So you became the hero.  And I became the schmuck.
Neutral ground.  What's up?
I lost him.  I was panicked.
You are lying, you never lost that kid for 4 <u>seconds</u>, you could find him from a <u>coma</u>, there is no WAY!
You're the hip and fresh.
Well, it wasn't a reduction like you do it!  Boiling down half a ton of bones...
No you don't.  And I'm not gonna screw with my kids heads right now --
Because I can't hurt anyone like this ever again.
That's not us.
No.  I'm doing it behind her back.
Hey. What's up?
You know...Stanley...
Well, I was thinking...I might work for you.
My grandchild-baby.
Oh. How did it happen?
Yes, I do. I love them!
You think so? You don't think that this might not be a little dry?
Nothing, I guessâ€
OK, you're right, you're rightâ€  You know, we need to screen what we've gotâ€invite some regular people, just some random off-the- street typesâ€and see what real people think of this.
You started filling out your college applications yet?
Oh. What happens now?
But it won't make any sense if you hear it out of context.
Don't be so upset. It's OK...
You're absolutely right. The focus is on the college admissions process today.
I have a cousin. Very big giver to the alumni fund.
And I also agreed with what you said today about Marcus's story. It is a piece of shit.
Say, 'Nigger.'
Ah-hah. And how is it you hope to achieve this goal?
Oh, fine. How are you?
Oh? Anything I might have seen?
Yeah. You didn't wanna take me to the prom.
Well, but it was so long ago. We were so different back then...
Yeah. But not any more.
Oh. Tired of 'life in the fast lane'?
Huh. Kids?
OK. Bye.
Thanks.
Oh. You mean, like, Blair Witch Project?
There isn't anyone! He's opened that whole sector now!
I don't know--look!  They can get in now, man!  We got no one left to guard it!
What happened!
What's that supposed to mean?
No but you didn't defend him either! Didn't want to rock the boat.  Guess the ride was too smooth. FILMORE I was acting under legal counsel!
There's the fence...
We're on sublevel six.  We'll pass some labs and then we'll hit the stairwell--
I insist...
I know what I'm here for-you don't need to remind me.
Excellent.
I say we head out.
Are you hungry?  We can discuss some final arrangements over some slop in the galley.
Well, there was uh, a little dissent about the amount of the bonus--
Dissent?
If I don't get power up we are!
We can't--it's power driven!
All right, Mister Ambassador!  But you must treat General "Buck" Schmuck with the respect due him.
The report is entirely untrue.  I can assure you of that.
Look, Colonel.  I've got to talk to somebody at Air Command.
Don't worry, Major.  Your rights will be fully protected.
What do you suppose is going to happen if General Ripper's planes start bombing their targets?
That certainly would be a problem, sir.
Youddon't think I'd ask if you recognized my voice unless it was important, do you, Major?
I don't think so, sir.
I see.
I know so, Major.  I know so.  And add to that, the whole Air Command force being committed to clobber everything they've got.
Right.
Then don't you realize the Bomb gives us Peace not War?  And, if that's the case, I ask you again: Why do they want disarmament?
I've heard the arguments.  Like Napoleon's quote, "There's one thing you can't do with a bayonet, and that's - sit on it."
Don't you think he knows something about this, General Ripper?
Yes, sir.  The base commander, General Ripper, selected Plan-R?
Then there's no chance for recall?
I'm not certain, Mister President.  The boys in CONCOM do the pencil work.
How many planes did we lose?
General Faceman, what was the name of the officer who called me from Burpelson?
Roughly, one-zero-five. I'll have it plotted in a minute, Major Kong.
Lothar, take your checks now.
Thanks, Binky.  Can you see Bromdingna Island yet?
He's right.  They must have clobbered some of our cities already.
Check.
They must have been fired from Bromdingna - probably one of their new Vampire - 202's. They've got a range well over a hundred miles.
Forty-five.  Still coming straight and fast. Twelve o' clock.
Call them every five miles.
We'll worry about that later.  Okay, I'll take damage reports.
Look, can't someone help me?
Must be Mach two-five stuff.  Altitude fifteen thousand.
Some kind of signaling.
Check, all bomb circuits green.  Okay, Lothar.
First safety.
All right, Lothat, that does it.  Master safety on now until bomb run.
Right.  So how could we get any messages?
First lesson in War College:  Never under- estimate your enemy.
Sorry, King.
Well, I can't get out and look, King.  But I don't get a green light.
Have you tried the emergency system?
There's no other way, boys.  I'm going to have to take her in...the hard way.
But who would be chosen?
Certainly not, sir.  When they go down into the mine, everyone else will still be alive.  They will have no shocking memories, and the prevailing emotion should be one of a nostalgia for those
Wait. Racism? You don't know anybody who's black!
Rehab. Outpatient. I have to go once a week. It's kind of like AA.
Behind me. I'm making these slides out of these old pictures and paintings and stuff.
Typical male.
No, thanks. I don't drink. Um, well, what'd she say? I mean, did she talk to him?
Yup.
Yeah. There was this cloud and I video taped it.
Oh.
No, I, you know, I help 'em out. I empty bedpans and bring 'em lunch. That kind of thing.
Sounds like a bummer.
Right now?
I don't know. Waiting, I guess. You know?
He's around and, you know, maybe he's coming by. Sooze told him to come by and hang out, whatever. It's no big deal. Me, him, and Sooze are gonna...
Yes!
Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff.
Same, more of the same. Yep, just keep doing the same thing all the time, around and around the clock. With an occasional burger or slice of thrown in for our vitamins and energy. Then, instead of watching Gilligan, we'd watch Captain Kirk.
Okay.
No, I mean, no one.
Hey, you know me.
No, no.
Oh, and guess who showed up.
What, they're looking for her?
No man, she showed up last night at the hotel. We has a great time together. I stayed in her room last night, man. What can I say?
She's dead.
She's dead?
That's bullshit. That's total utter bullshit.
Yeah, man.
Let's go look, then. Let's go look, then!
Come on.
Play it! Come on!
Mm, in a horizontal and wet way!
Playing with something really hot. Yeah.
It's okay.
Oh, So what about her?
Oh, yeah, all the time. That's what I do now.
Yeah!
Okay, come on. Time to slow down.
Okay.
It's nice here. It's different.
So you, like, come from a town like this or...?
No, not really. I come from an "area". Bel Air.
Oh, me too. Middle-class.
Erica.
Yeah?
I'm sorry.
Funny shit, man.
Mm-mm.
Two-fifty? They go up?
Uh-huh.
Who were you talking to?
No.
Well, w-what happened?
No.
Look, your trespassing.
No.
It's a piece.
No, no, no. I'm not being cynical, I'm being honest.
Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, right. Fuck you.
Can I talk?
I don't know. I would've done something. This is kind of hypothetical, isn't it? This place is so stupid. I can't believe we're sitting here in this mosh-pit of consumerism. With all these people eating their chunks of dead flesh...
... like fucking robots. Look at those kids there.
So, what, why can't you do that here? What's wrong with here? Why is somewhere else better?
Why should I stay here, Jeff? So we can sit on the corner and watch the lights change, while you bitch about Burnfield?
So I can spend the rest of my life guessing what it would be like to be a real artist?
What?
To his hotel?
No, maybe not though. That, that's what I'm trying to say.
You're unbelievable.
You did, huh? Good for you.
Yeah, good.
What?
Yeah, maybe later.  Hey! Hey!
Well, not exactly.
No, no, they, uh, you know, that can be kind of a hassle, so , uh, you know, I just stay at the Four Seasons. It's easier.
What do you mean?
I don't know. Uh, I'm an artist, I guess. You know, there's life and then there's the people watching the life, commenting on it.
What?
Look, man, it... Shit. Why don't we get something to eat? I mean food?
You know, why do you call me names? You know, I never hurt you. I'm only working here.
This has nothing to do with me, this, uh, drinking, yeah.
No, this has everything to do with you.
Hey it's your roof. It's your fucking problem.  Hi, uh, there's an emergency down at the Circle A on first Street, Yeah, Okay.  You're fucked now, pal!  Um, send an ambulance 'cause I, I think it's an overdose or something. Okay. Okay.  Jeff, they're coming. Just wait here. I'm gonna go over to Scuff's and see if he's got his truck.  Listen, if she dies, you're gonna be so sorry that you ever showed your brown face in this town!
You showed up. Oh, my god! Holy shit! Look at this car, man!
It's stupid.
Look at you!
Yeah.
I get final approval. It's in my contract.
Yeah, we'd have to fly you out for meetings, you know.
Hey, man, uh, look, if you don't like my stuff, uh, I won't sing it, okay? I'm sorry, you know?
No, I'm going.
You do?
Where do you get your ideas?
I called Bucky's. I got her a cab. Is there any hot mustard?
Well, I mean, she always answers her beeper.
Oh, okay, it's none of my business. Yeah, so, you-you're trying to fuck my best friend's girlfriend and it's none of my business?!
Uh, eleven twenty-five.
It's not the air force anymore, Scuff
At least I have a point of view, you know?
Ha! Thank you! See? He did it. He left.
Fucking drunk, huh?
Oh that's nice for you.
Shut up, Cleo.  Di, how much do you need for an abortion?
Oh for Chrissakes...  "White trash Betty."  I didn't realize the rules went into effect before we entered Safeway.
It's twins!!
Bye.
Positive.
If you don't - can you still afford to go to Harvard?
I've got to get that.  Relax.  I'll see you tomorrow.
Me too!  Will it ever end?!  I love this lady!
Oh... What are you working on?
Lucy, do you know for sure you're going to get that scholarship?
I'm sorry, Diane, but I'm not gonna watch my dreams fade away 'cause the Virgin Mary here thinks she's gonna get ideas from kiddie movies --
Di, it's not your fault.  We all wanted to do this - for you... for ourselves.
Bullets.
Or that!  Look, you guys, I just want to provide a future for my baby.  I know my bank branch like the back of my puffy little hand.  I could open that safe in my sleep!
I'll get them before "Touched by an Angel," don't worry.
Maybe we can make a deal.
I know, but we can't quite figure out how to, y'know, do it.
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. de Mille.
You'll pardon me, Norma? Why don't you just sit and watch?  O.K.  Here we go.
In a deep freeze.
Schaefer.  Betty Schaefer.  And right now I wish I could crawl into a hole and pull it in after me.
That was last year.  This year I'm trying to earn a living.
There's one called....Window... something with a window.
I had a teacher like that once.
With a wildly beating heart.
Sheldrake likes that angle about the teacher.
You sure have.
See if they make sense.  To begin with, I think you should throw out all that psychological stuff -- exploring a killer's sick mind.
This story is about teachers -- their threadbare lives, their struggles.  Here are people doing the most important job in the world, and they have to wprry about getting enough money to re-sole their shoes.  To me it can be as exciting as any chase, any gunplay.
Now I see her teaching day classes while he teaches night school.  The first time they meet ...
And here's a title: AN APPLE FOR THE TEACHER.
I was born just two blocks from this studio.  Right on Lemon Grove Avenue.  Father was head elec- trician here till he died.  Mother still works in Wardrobe.
Second generation, huh?
Saddest thing I ever heard.
Not once.  What's wrong with being on the other side of the cameras? It's really more fun.
It must be my new shampoo.
That's no shampoo.  It'smore like a pile of freehly laundred hand- kerchiefs, like a brand new auto- mobile.  How old are you anyway?
I just don't.
You did.
No.
If you love me, Joe.
Look, sweetie -- be practical. l've got a good thing here. A long-term contract with no options. I like it that way.  Maybe it's not very admirable.  Well, you and Artie can be admirable.
You'd better.  I'm very angry.
I'm pretty busy, as you can see...
Don't play innocent.  Somebody named Gordon Cole.
And if you hadn't been pretty darned interested in that script, he wouldn't have tried to get me on the phone ten times.
I don't care about the money. I just want to work again.  You don't know what it means to know that you want me.
I don't care anyway.  I want the coffin to be white.  And I want it specially lined with satin. White, or deep pink.
I'm sorry, and I'm sorry you lost your friend, and I don't think red is the right color.
Get out.
I knew there was something wrong with them.
You are! Writing words, words! You've made a rope of words and strangled this businessl But there is a microphone right there to catch the last gurgles, and Technicolor to photograph the red, swollen tongue!
I hate that word.  It is a return. A return to the millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen.
This is fascinating.
I don't know.
December twenty-first.
Thank you.
Oh no.  I couldn't let it out of my house.  You'll have to finish it here.
You can stay here.
You can't work in an apartment where you owe three months' rent.
Okay.  We'll deduct it from my salary.
What scene?
Nothing, if you work in a fill- ing station.  And I'm getting rather bored with that sport jacket, and those same baggy pants.  Max, what's a good men's shop in town?  The very best... Well, go there !
What's that?
They're awful.  They make me cough.
Good.
I was a little worried about the line of my throat.  This woman has done wonders with it.
I just happen to know it.  I had a nightmare and I screamed for you.  You weren't here.  Where were you?
It's yours, Joe.  I gave it to you.
Oh.  sure -- if it would make a good scene.
Wanted what?
Goodbye.  Norma.
Dressed for what?
She was the greatest.  You wouldn't know.  You are too young.  In one week she got seventeen thousand fan letters.  Men would bribe her mani- curist to get clippings from her fingernails.  There was a Maharajah who came all the way from Hyderabad to get one of her stockings.  Later, he strangled himself with it.
Who said you could?  Who asked you to?
It was the room of the husband. Or of the husbands, I should say. Madame has been married three times.
Madame's doctor.  She has moments of melancholy.  There have been some suicide attempts.
You send them.  Is that it, Max?
I'd better press your evening clothes, sir.  You have not for- gotten Madame's New Year's party.
It's just that I'm very worried about Madame.
Sure you are.  And we're not help- ing her any, feeding her lies and more lies.  Getting herself ready for a pioture ...  What happens when she finds out?
I directed all her early pictures. There were three young directors who showed promise in those days: D.W. Grirrith, C.B. deMille, and Max von Mayerling.
What car?
It's about a ball player, a rookie shortstop that's batting 347.  The poor kid was once mixed up in a hold- up.  But he's trying to go straight -- except there's a bunch of gamblers who won't let him.
So they tell the kid to throw the World Series, or else, huh?
Bases Loaded.  There's a 4O-page outline.
Any kind of assignment.  Additional Dialogue.
Could I?  Gillis, last year some- body talked me into buying a ranch in the valley.  So I borrowed money from the bank so I could pay for the ranch.  This year I had to mortgage the ranch so I could keep up my life insurance so I could borrow on the insurance so I could pay my income tax.  Now if Dewey had been elected -
Gillis, get this through your head.  I'm not just your agent. It's not the ten per cent.  I'm your friend.
Now, now do you belive me? I told you deMille would jump at it.
Oh, yes, yes.  They're below, waiting for the Princess ... I'm ready.
How can you create beauty...with a selfish heart? The spiky insect-creature flies closer and closer around the little girl's head, buzzing angrily. Her look of delight turns to fear. She tries to shoo the creature away. It flies off toward the thin membrane that encloses the city.
The Coffer of Shadow. Look at it.
The danger. The one Nigel spoke of. It must be near .
He will be. In about five minutes.
And the first thing we do is get rid of Supergirl!
I'm sorry, but I already promised Bianca she could have Switzerland. You know how she loves to ski.
No problem. She can have it. I hate mountains.
I have to.
You love me?
My angel. My goddess. I feel I've always loved you all my life. I'll die if I can't spend the rest of my life just looking at you, holding you in my arms...
Yes. It reminds me of home.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
It's not important. The important thing is I'm here to find something and I think you can he1p me.
Ethan---when I said 'a while' I meant a couple of hours.
I'm not mad at you.
I know I was acting funny---I'm sorry. It's just...I miss it.
Miss what?
But what if---it wasn't real?
In this big old house on Orchard Avenue---but you better stay away from there.
She has hostages.
I bet they do.
What's that big black scar on the ground? Like a fire.
I know it.
You can't escape from me that easily. I'm afraid you don't know who I am.
Theories?
Oh, sure.
How do you know?
It's something they have on Earth. You know, where your cousin went.
Yes, I know the equations---I just can't see it in my head.
You sure?
Oh, I don't know. I'm not signed out for an overnight.
He's nice.
What? Me?
It may well be. I know how you won that election Selena. You can't fool me.
Cigarette?
You used to listen to me. When you asked me to teach you something of the Craft.
I was just thinking, if I had your skin problems, I'd use a good tannisroot ointment. Every night.
Such a shame. You ought to take better care of yourself.
I don't scare that easily.
For what?
Yes. I went there to find the lost Power Source...
Criminals.
No, no. Not lovely. 'Perfect'. Did everything just right. Nobody telling you to change this, move that around. Please yourself. That's the secret of happiness.
Told you. Wouldn't listen to me. Knew it would make you sad.
Of course, my dear. What can I do?
Better than when I was a child.
Too late. Too late. Save yourself.
Buddy, are we in trouble.
Roebush! That's  the guy! Buddy, he's gonna nail our behinds to the wall! this is Special Order! He said he had to have it before...  Omigod!! What's tomorrow?
TUESDAY! I got to get it all set up in his office tonight before all those big shots come here tomorrow for the meeting!!
Clark.
Too much mayonnaise?
Ricky. My little boy. At least here we've got a house. and I've got a job. Okay, I'm only a secretary, oaky, but it pays the bills. Except for last winter when the fuel bills kept going up and up and up.  I even had to pawn my diamond ring then.
I mean him.
Well, this pate is rather...unusual.
Well, aren't you excited?
Me too. That's why I put this one up.
What!
Mmmmm . . .
At one o'clock in the morning?
Gus Gorman.
Kitchen. . . Technician
Not counting this week.  You secured employment last June as a messenger and were discharged after one day for. . .
First rip-off, man! Supposed to be 225 bucks a week! You know what this sucker says?? $143.80!  Federal tax! State tax! Social Security tax!
I ain't gonna live that long on $143.80! I want it now, man, while I'm still young and cool.
They don't actually lose 'em. You can't lose what you never got.
So where is all them half-centses?
Say who?
Mr. Gorman, just answer me one question...
Yes! That never occurred to me.  Her ya go, buddy, single-malt.  Gus, my friend, you're a genius. Okay, a naughty genius, but hell, nobody's perfect.
Black or regular?
Just the man I wanted to see!
Wait a second. Astronomers know where the planet used to be, right? And you know what happens when a planet explodes? Debris. Pieces floating in space.
Huh?
Don't lay that jail number on me no more. You need me out here doin' stuff for you more'n sitten' in no jail doin' nothin' for nobody.  'Sides, I be known' some heavy stuff about you now. You don't want em spillin' the coffee beans.
For what?
A computer.
Not like this one you ain't. Nobody in the world got one like this 'cause it don't exist yet. We got to build it.
Tell me more...
Man, all it got to do is find their weak spot.  You bet on the machine in any fight you name, you gonna win your bet.
Can't wait, pal, can't wait.
That's up to the judge, Gus. It's not your problem anymore.
Watch out for them air pockets!
Sister! I'm his sister!
But the bridge...
The bridge...?  I'd better get going!
Okay, what is it? You want a ride?
53!
By hand. Like the pioneers did.
Storms! Floods!
Well, Webco has a hundred and twelve subsidiaries and every one of them is tied to our central computer system. How about...hmmmm, someplace small...
Today coffee----
Then maybe you should get your glasses checked.
Maybe I could try --
Aw, c'mon -- anybody can get hungry.
I mean it strikes me funny that every time Superman comes around, you disappear.
Superman? Oh, was he here?
Listen, I've got to give you credit. Your disguise is nearly perfect. I mean, if you fooled me, and I am nobody's fool --
Uh-uh.  Listen, I'll tell you what. You say I'm wrong. And I say I'm right. So why don't we make a little bet on it?
How could you win a crazy bet like --
Oh, hi.
Everybody. Everybody else. I'd be buying my little rainbow at the their expense. All the ones who say "Help. Come quick. Now" I know who you'd have to pick.
What else could I do?
Don't you watch television? Don't you listen to the radio?
Does she know about it? She's in it!
No, I meant, it's awfully dangerous.
So does your average cocker spaniel. Give me another one.  Under . . . the big one there.
I'll be alright.
No, me, me, me. Thank you.
I think he said a "curl."
Patience, Kal-El. You begin to sound like an Earthling. SUPERMAN Mother, you speak only of honor, of sacrifice, of responsibility --
Sensible enough.
I didn't ask her anything . . .
OTIS, your brain defies any known scientific laws in its infinite capacity to deteriorate. Every man has a vulnerable point. Some like you Otis, have more that one. I didn't see Superman's in time. But now through patience, invention and skill, my 	black box is just about ready.
Oh no.  I really like it sometimes.  And if it weren't for him, I wouldn't have met you.
Luthor, you poisonous snake . . .
Listen. Have I got a proposition for you, Superman. I mean I owe you one, you know? Now don't say yes or no till you hear me out . . .
North. Keep going North!
Yes, but will you honor it?
Free!
Stay. I will come to you.
"Super-sucker . " For once, Lex Luthor was right.
Well, I'm feeling a lot better . . . almost chipper . . .  . . . and all because I had a visit from a very good nurse.
If my plan works, gentlemen, I'll just take a tiny commission . . . something . . .appropriate. . . a number with a lot of zeros after it.
Oh . . . no . . . I mean, we just went  dancing . . . for  a story . . .
Why, Lois, I didn't know . . . Who is he?
It always is with Clark.
There!
You're just an experiment, freako!
What?
I think he has his own plan, Uncle Lex.
Me? Now? With Superman dead and you on my team? It's like I'm the coach and you're the best power forward ever. What could I have to fear?
Know something? You're a workaholic. A good guy 24 hours a day. Stop and smell the roses sometime. Take up a hobby. Get a pet . . . a kitten or a puppy. . .
No, no, listen. I escaped with only one thing on my mind . . . the end of Superman.
Precisely. And then it came to me. My greatest ever plan. I made a deal with some minor league Bad Boys. Arms Dealers, Renegades Generals, You know the type. With you gone, we'll make a fortune rearming the world.
Nobody else.
Thank you.
Otherwise, you're a Mongoloid idiot.  It's reasonable to assume that fragments of the planet were shot out into space by the force of the explosion, and  --
Not really, no.
He may have a gun!
Huh?
Don't you ever give up?
It wasn't a trick!
Oh sure. A man flies in the sky like a pigeon and it wasn't a trick.
Oh.
Compared to what came before? A year of living in the sewers?  A part of that will always be with me.
He's from another world.
See? I see. It's you who don't see. Doesn't see. I cannot believe it! How you people fail to grasp the long-range significance of this! Y'know?
You're not going to tell us why you're happy, are you?
Weak sister.  I still can't figure out why it took so long for you to catch up with us after we all ran out. Y'know?
I knew you'd hit me.
Baby -- I'm going to take you higher.
Two.
He sure as heck does that.
Okay, but...why?  No offense.
Right on the first guess.
Wha'...what are you doing here?
If I do, you can punish  me. Fly me to Bermuda and just lave me there for two weeks.  This is fantastic! I wish Clark were here.
You think they're strange?
The reason I can fly is because my molecular structure is so constituted that I have a lighter density under Earth's gravitational force.
How old are you?
Uh-huh.
Sure.
Matter? With me? Nothing's the matter.
I gave him this new face.
You're right, you're right, Superman. There were wrinkles to iron out. But, well...  ...there is this new rocket, the XK 101.
I know. I know.  I never promised myself a rose garden.
For the first time today, Superman I must tell you that you're wrong.  But how could you know that -  Oh, well. I guess I could tell you now. Y'see, actually...but this conversation is becoming rather dry, isn't it.
I'm just fine, Ally.  What about you?
I'm fine.  Still working with my father.
Mitchell.  It was nice to see you again, Ally.
Mister, I don't want to know your name.
I don't know.
Nicole, I'm just going to pack all this stuff and give it to the church for charity.  Don't feel bad. Unless you feel strange about wearing it.
The children.
Why not?
So?  I mean, lot's of folks have got lawyers.
C'mon, you know that won't...
It's not enough.  For hospital bills.  For Nicole.
Billy, that's too early.
Yes.
Do they have any reputation for drugs?
Who's been talking to you about what I'm feeling?  Who should care about what I'm feeling?
Well, it's certainly what you'd call interesting.
I could wrap it up.  Protect the other kids.
I'll...take it straight.
Your Dad spent all his spare time in here.  He wanted to make it absolutely perfect.
Yes.  It's a present.
Oh.
What, Mason?
Okay.
What do you want me to do for you, Mr. Stephens?
You seem very sure about that.
Thank you, Nicole.
She...she was a friend of mine.
That's good.  Judges like adopted Indian boys.  Tell me more about the Ottos.
Crafts.
Crafts?
I...I just need to know what state you're in so I know...how to talk to you...how to act...
I'm calling because I've got some news for you, Daddy.  Some big news.
Okay.  I went to sell blood yesterday.  That's how it is.  I'm in this fucking city where my father is a hot shit lawyer, and I'm selling my blood.
Do you have the blood test?
What is it?
If you could pick the shrimp off, as well as anything that touches the shrimp...
Yes.
You are angry, aren't you, Mrs. Otto?  That's why I'm here.  To give your anger a voice.  To be your
It's my belief that Dolores was doing exactly what she'd been doing for years.  Besides, the school board's insurance on Dolores is minimal.  A few million at the very most.  The really deep pockets are to be found in the town, or in the company that made the bus.
Probably half a dozen traffic convictions.  Drunk driving.  Lost his licence.  That's why he don't work no more.
Was there anything unusual about the driver, Dolores Driscoll, or the bus that particular morning?
Like what?  I mean, I don't remember a lot.
And where did you sit that morning?
My usual place.  On the right side. The first seat.
Why were you scared?
Really?
You mean it?
You don't sound like one hundred percent absolutely sure.
The ramp?
You seem...I don't know...well, distant, I guess.  Hard to talk to.
You don't know that.
Alone or surrounded?
Don't apologize for me, Frank!
We're on our way there now...
Not in those exact words - you know what a temper he's got.
Four five nights ago.  That's how I know the romance is off.  Also Steve's in a very bad mood.
If it were that easy, you wouldn't find an empty phone booth for the next two hours...
Hurry back.
Right now you're in no position to ask questions!  And your snide remarks---
Those "dears" sound like daggers. May I suggest that you stop DARING her to speak?
She mighta jumped.  Love suicide?  Check it for me, Phil...it's a real heart throb.
I remember ONCE when you didn't quite "put things together".  Boy! Was the Mayor mad!
Everyone knows Manny Davis...  ...except MRS. Manny Davis.
I don't?
I'll listen one more minute.
Correct me if I'm wrong - WE! Because when I'm out on this very slippery limb for you, you have to know what's involved.
What you promised - do it!  Don't finagle around.  It's later than you think.
J.J., you said you want to help me - prove it!
How?
Can't hurt?  I had to get him back his job.
Integrity - acute, like indigestion.
Is that why you were romancing her, you mutt!  Let's call it quits, my dear.  I'd like it fine if you found another home.  That means the front door is open!  Pack your things, rent a moving van and GIT!  And as for marriage, let me hit you with a few choice facts: you aren't ready for marriage!  You're incompetent - a capricious and shaky frail with a sick fatality for frail and useless men!
- He's got them on him.
Well, I'll be darned.  And what does J.J. think he SHOULD do?
Go out with DIFFERENT girls!
Dallas?  Could be.  He doesn't look like a reefer smoker...
I've been up to here.  Listen, honey, tell me something.  You know Susan Hunsecker...?  Has she been in?  I mean lately, in the last coupla days...?
This sort of thing!
What would you think of me if -
It isn't.  I've just seen the early edition.
And leave a tip in every hat-check room in town?
I know you do, Sidney.
That's your idea of logic?  I tell the Judge I didn't murder the man - the Judge says, "Why not you?"
According to you, yeah.  Dallas, your mouth is as big as a basket and twice as empty!  I don't like you, comma, but neither do I go along with this column saying you smoke marijuana and belong with the Reds.  Also, since we're talking repulsive, J.J. won't like this for two cents!  Don't give me that look, Dallas - J.J. believes in fair play.  And secondly, this could splatter his sister with rotten egg by implication - your her boyfriend!
Speak to this lad, Al, ... to Mr. Falco.
You tell him, I stutter!
I'm not a man, Sidney, I'm -
Steve, I'd rather you didn't say anything for a day or two...until I tell my brother...
But you didn't do much about it, Susie.  You walked out, and there I was...solo...and not too good at that.
I told your brother I couldn't be his accomplice.  I can't be yours either, Susie, and encourage him to go on pulverizing you.  I know what type - he's my old man all over again!
You are saying goodbye, aren't you...?
You need a break.  You'll see it clear when you come back.
Let me try mine.
No way!
This in intense.  Get a grip, John.  Okay, uh... you're not here to kill me... I figured that part out for myself.  So what's the deal?
What does that mean?
Negative.  She is not a mission priority.
I sense injuries.  The data could be called pain.
A hundred and twenty years on my existing power cell.
No problemo.
It is in your nature to destroy yourselves.
Uh-unh, no, it's different... It's when there's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway.  You get it?
I don't care.  We've gotta stop her.
Oh.  Yeah.  They... make me take this stuff...
You see, Sarah... here's the problem.  I know how smart you are, and I think you're just telling me what I want to hear.  I don't think you really believe who you've been telling me today.
So do you.
Because Skynet knows the Russian counter-strike will remove its enemies here.
Son of a bitch, I knew it!
Eating is eating... and...
But I promised your mother.
Sounds a lot of run.  So they sent the big guns to check up on me. We recruiting children now?
I guess so, sir.
Some.
So, what does the Russki want?
My manner? Why don't you go downstairs, get a cup of coffee and calm down? What's the matter, Emmi? What's going on with you? What's wrong?
FurtwÃ¤ngler's in a different category.
Yeah, yeah, art and politics, yeah, yeah, I heard all about that.
There have been messages for you.  A Lieutenant David Wills called from the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs office in Wiesbaden. I don't know who he is.
Oh yes, Major, I have recordings of all his symphonies. I kept them safe during the bombing. My favourite is the Seventh Symphony.
Mine's the Eleventh.
I have already been cleared by a Denazification Tribunal in Austria.
I received a telegram from Hermann Goering informing me that he had made me a Privy Councillor. I was not given the opportunity either to accept or refuse. After the dreadful events of November 1938, the violent attacks on the Jews, I stopped using the title.
Let me me help you, then. You picked up the phone and made a call -  'Hello, Adolf? Wilhelm speaking. Listen, old pal, there's a Jew-boy musician I want you to help. He needs a permit to get to Paris.'
When will my case be heard by the Tribunal?
Your guess is as good as mine.
I wasn't told. I just knew it.
I believe art and politics should be separate, but that they weren't kept separate I learned to my cost.
And when did you first learn that - when you sent the telegram? Was that the surrender signal, the waving of the white flag?
'Happy birthday, dear Adolf, love Wilhelm.' Or words to that effect. That sounds to me like you were dropping on your knees and saying, 'Okay, Adolf, you win. You're the number one man. Have a swell party.'
I have no idea what you're talking about.
No, because I had only one intention. My only intention whatever I did was to show that music means more than politics.
Well. Once he said he'd read what this man wrote about me.
I'm sorry.
I believe that. But just answer the question, don't give me explanations.
Of course I know what that is.
Bruckner's Seventh. The Adagio.
I'll tell you, then. The last time this music was played on these air waves was after they announced that your pal Hitler had shot himself. Listen to it.  They listen. Did they pick little K's recording? Did they pick some other conductor? No, they picked you, and why? Because you represented them so beautifully. When the Devil died, they wanted his bandleader to conduct the funeral march. You were everything to them.
Do you know Hans Hinkel?
Do I know Hans Hinkel?
Love 'em, Helmuth. I give up. What are you holding in your hand?
The one he kept in his right hand. Yes, you remember.
Major, we're discussing a man of genius, I don't want...
One of your people told me.
Who's he?
But this was the same guy who conducted for Adolf on his birthday.
He was forced to do that. But he refused to give the Nazi salute in front of Hitler. He kept his baton in his hand, you can't salute with a baton in your hand.
Yes.
When you got to the crescendo.
Well, they say here that when you went on a case, you stayed on it.  Now we can't take every Nazi in this country to trial, although I would like to; it's an impossibility. So we're going for the big boys in industry, education, law, culture.
Just what you see, pal.
Wrong.
That guy's a jerk.  I did you a favor.
I'll do the same for you sometime.
I'm here to help you.  Reese, Sergeant/Tech-Com, DN38416...
No.  Not yet.  Not for about forty years.
Right.
Well, at least I know what to name him.  I don't suppose you'd know who the father is? So I don't tell him to get lost when I meet him.
About what?
About where you're from.
Tactically dangerous.  We lay low.
Listen.  Understand.  I'm not a military objective, Reese.  I'm a person... You don't own me.
Hot dogs?
I want to buy you a hot dog so bad,Kyle...all the things you've never seen and done.  You're here, but wherever you go, and whatever you touch, you bring the war with you.
I want it to be over for you.
Don't say that.
No.  I'm not.
Most official records were lost in the war.  The computer knew almost nothing about Connor's mother.  Her name. Where she lived, just the city. No scanner pictures.  The Terminator was just being systematic.
I'm afraid that's not up to me.
You gotta be kidding me.  The new guys'll be short-stroking it over this one.  A one-day pattern killer.
I hate the weird ones.
Call her.
Now, look...
"Whereas once I was blind, now I can see."  Night, Nick.  Best of luck.
Please, don't do that...
Don't just stand there, get help!
He's pissing his pants.  Is that real enough for you?  Call 911!
Are you suggesting we wait till someone finds us?
You first.
Why... ?
Keep it.
Can we talk?
Let me go get some clothes on. We'll talk, okay?  Be right back.
Take the picture out of the frame and show it to me.
Get out of my car!
You don't have a choice.  No one else is going to tell you what's going on.
What do we do?
I'm back from the dead.
Get us out!
Who's responsible?!
I have to show you...
That's my fault.  I get too worked up at these.  I'm very method.  You do know... that's not my name.
I didn't know what else to call you.
Like what... my favorite color... ?
Too bad, I liked her.  So, you're all alone in the House of Pain?
You've heard of it.  You've seen other people having it.  They're an entertainment service, but more than that.
It's a profound life experience.
Call them.  Trust me.
Okay, okay... okay?  I just... you know I hate surprises.
I know...
Yeah, almost...
How do you mean, exactly?
Calm down.  Why would they keep playing after you paid?
It always is.
Of course you can have it if you need it.  Can I get you something to eat?
What is?
May I make two suggestions... ?
Do you really expect me to participate without knowing a single thing?
Hey, everyone -- snack time!  Here... here you go...
The key?
Thank you.  Goodnight.
There was an incident a few days ago... a nervous breakdown, they said.  The police took him.  They left this address, in case anyone...
The Fitzwilliam Botanical Garden Annual Fundraiser.
I know who she is.  Take a message.
Pardon me?  I'm afraid I don't...
Cancel lunch.  Make reservations at Campton Place for me and Mr. Butts.
Nice touch.  Does the game use real bullets... ?
Nothing.  Nothing at all.
Follow me.
And what kind of sleeper?
Well, I... uh...
Do we still get paid for the week?
That depends on your definition of ghosts.  I'm going to check on her, and then I'm going to stay awake.
-- how much is this car worth?
Where in the hell can she be.
We can't stay here looking for her.  She doesn't want to be found...
And that will be a good place to end this study.
She needed a job, Malcolm.  And she's smart.  And she helps me.
For an American you do a good imitation of the British at their most apologetic.  Pardon me.  Excuse me, sorry, sorry...
So... smell... is... Smell is the sense that triggers the most powerful memories.  And a memory can trigger a smell.
What happened after you smelled it?
I don't know.
No, but Nell's been here longer than I have.
Oh!  You scared me.
Are you Mister Dudley, the caretaker?
Yes.
Why?
Well, I've never lived with beauty.  You must love working here.
A blank canvas!  I could paint your portrait, directly on you. Or maybe not.  So, you?  Husbands? Boyfriends?  Girlfriends?  Where do you live?
I don't have anyone.  But I do have a little apartment of my own.  It has a little flower garden.  You can just see the ocean.  At night, when the wind comes in just right, you can hear the buoys in the harbor.
I don't know.  You've been alone for a long time, maybe you want attention.  Maybe he did it...
I'm trying.  Have you ever kept something to yourself because you were afraid it'd ruin things.
Okay.
I <u>want</u> to know why you <u>need</u> that scary guy in your house.
I'm not.
I'm so glad we're having this chat.
It's an observation.  Like:  I'm hungry. When are we eating?
Not who, food.  Should we get Italian.
It must've been a time.  A golden moment.
When you find the guy, you'll know.
Fuck you, Mr. whatever-your-name is. This is a lifestyle I embrace.
What kind?
No, Terry.  They don't work like that. Jenny Wilson's father paid a little visit, left a message.
No.  I mean.  Not even your people should be involved.  Right?  It's too close now.
Close Quarters Combat.  Keep one in my own home.
No reason.
I dunno ... Maybe they do.
That's what I thought, man.  But it was not a hotel or nothin' that we went to. It was someplace else.
She didn't write to me, did she.
Five years, I think.  Long time.
And that's where you met Jenny.
Who'd you butcher at the house?
Huh?
Again?
Not much -- you?
Probably.
I was gonna be in that Michael Mann movie, you know -- with Pacino and DeNiro.  Got three callbacks.
Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?
No, why did you come here?
It's been a while.
That's not what I heard.
When you've lost as many years as I have, love, puts things in perspective, know what I mean.
Eight hours difference between here and London.  Would've been, what, ten in the morning, my time.  I was just coming out on the yard.  Now, I was in the habit of saving my newspaper till then.  Bit of fresh air, stretch me legs -- well, stretch the day out, really, that's what you wanna do.  And I'll tell ya:  I couldn't open the paper.  Could not pry the pages apart -- it was like they was glued together.  That's how weak my hands went.  Thought I was having heart attack, only I knew I wasn't.  Bloke come up to me, he says, Dave, he says, you've gone all white.  I said, fuck me, I've been in prison half my life, what d'ya expect. But he was dead on, 'cause I could feel the blood drain right out of me head. And I knew ...  Something had happened to Jen.
Now, you shouldn't run yourself down.  My employer, Mr. Lindgren --
What do you think.
She told you all about my details but not about his.  Lovely.
She'd never called me like that before. She sounded more ... pissed off -- angry -- than upset or afraid.  But she never turned up.  I called the house but only got the answer machine.  When they found her ... she'd been going the wrong way. Not the direction she'd have gone if she'd been coming to see me.  Or coming <u>straight</u> to see me.  Who knows.  Maybe she just wanted to drive.
I was inside once.  I punched a cop at a demo.
Who remembers.
Stick with me, kid.  Looks big when you get here but you can cover it in five minutes.
Do us a favor.  Can't even go have a slash without 'em saying, what're you going in there for?
Too bleeding true, 'n' it.
Because that wasn't anything to do with me.  And suspicion has been cast in my direction.  Didn't make any sense.  Choosing those shitheads over me, cutting me out of the deal, then screwing them over too.
Your client have a deal in Long Beach? How about downtown?  There's some folks there -- oh, wait, they're all dead.  Any of this ring a bell?
I can never decide what I like better. Leaving home, or coming back.
Yeah.  Another little matter needs attending to soon as I return.
I had to, didn't I.  Nothing else for it. Then just when I'd finished my nine years -- my contract -- wallop, I had to bugger off to the States.
Sounds like you need a rest.
Jesus, are you gay enough or what.
Looks like they just airbrushed the dick out of his mouth.
Any happier than any other asshole in life.
You bet.
While they're all fucking each other over ... couple of parties like us could move right in.
You walked.  What the hell are you doing here.
-- You know his name is Frank.
Go now.
I suppose that's good, unless things were fine the way they were.
Yes. Thank you.
Yes, Ann?
We went camping last summer. In Eugene, Oregon. *Outside* of Eugene, Ed.
We've certainly missed you.
Oh, Mr Crane--
Huh. Yeah. Maybe...
But I do appreciate it, Mr Crane...
Birdy--
Please, Mr Crane, it's OK, please--
Well? How'd she do?
I don't understand, no mistakes, she's just a kid--I thought you taught the, uh, the--
Well, it's the wildest goose there is. Risk money. Very speculative. Except, Ed, in certain situations, it's not, see? I thought I had a prospect here. Well, I make the haul up and this lousy so-and-so tells me his situation has changed--all his capital's gonna be tied up in expansion plans of his own. Thank you, mother! Pop goes another bubble! It's only the biggest business opportunity since Henry Ford and I can't seem to interest a soul!
Huh.
I'll have it in a week.
Maybe.
Pretty straightforward, but I don't know if you wanna show this stuff to a lawyer--
Uh-huh.
Look, uh... Creighton...
OK.
$10,000! I don't know what to do, Ed. I don't know what I *can* do. Even though I know who the sonofabitch is.
Would he... it sounds pretty obvious.
Come on in.
Who?
I didn't say a word.
You don't have to--
Terrific. Your husband backs you up. That's terrific.
It was Big Dave's.
Look, chum, this is a guy, from what I understand, told everybody he was a war hero, right? Island hopping, practically liberated the Pacific all by himself with a knife in one hand and a gun in the other and twenty yards of Jap guts between his teeth.
Yeah.
And now it turns out this dope spent the war sitting on his ass in some boatyard in San Diego. You asked for blackmail, let me give you blackmail: Mr Hale-Fellow-Well-Met, about to open his own business here, has been lying to everybody in this town for the last four years, probably including half the people sitting on that jury. Well, it finally caught up with him--these dopes, it always does; someone threatened to spill it. Somebody knew his dirty little secret, just like your wife says. They called, they demanded money...
...He told them to look at me--look at me close. That the closer they looked the less sense it would all make, that I wasn't the kind of guy to kill a guy, that I was the barber, for Christ's sake...
I'm fine.
OK. Boy. Jesus!
Check out the rack on that broad in the angora.
Sure, go to the store. Go there, describe to the man where you will be fishing, and for what, and the weather conditions, sun, no sun, whatnot, and so forth, and then you might as well have the man go ahead and sell you the goddamn FISH, Ed...
Yeah, yeah--go home.
What the--
I'm gonna mingle it with common house dirt.
Uh-huh.
We're just closing, friend.
Could you come with me please?
They sent us to tell ya.
Get his gun and his walkie talkie, Jonathan.  Move.
I'll do it.  Just let me find my portable phone.
That would leave one exit for hundreds of people.  You'd be violating every fire regulation on the books.  We'll guard the perimeter with my men and engage the motion detectors in the other cells.  One more question.  I see a big hole.  If this entire thing is run by computer, what happens if the power fails?
I drink.  After hours of course.  On duty, I smoke.  Do you mind?
This isn't an animal, Vince.  I've been on this case four months, remember?  I've learned a few things.
We haven't got time.  You have to meet with museum security so we can make a decision about tonight.
I'm one of the few who know every inch it, now that John is gone.
It's important.  Please.  You have to come!  Pendergast, too.  She's found out something.
What's that doing here?
I'd say we're in its home.
We can't do without you.  You're one of the foremost authorities on primitive pharmacology.  You're practically an institution around here.
Healing plant use among the Ki tribe of Bechuanaland has been cancelled to make room for Tibetan Erotic Art.
Several problems with that theory. For one thing, this egg is intact. For another, according to Pendergast, the crates were shipped here on a boat.  Everyone on board was killed like Beauregard.  If the thing hatched in mid-ocean, where did it go?
That thing could kill ten people in a matter of minutes.
And failed.  These doors are solid steel.
Read it out loud.
He's right.
There's another possibility.  A lot of repeated base pairs could suggest a high level of genetic damage.
Yes.  Whatever killed Beauregard may have lived on this plant.  When the crates were put in secure storage, they were out of reach.  The killer couldn't get them, so it got the next best thing.
Not today.  Besides, I think the director of the museum is expecting you.
My God.  Then it was an animal.
They're all heavily armed.
Gone.
The planetarium!
Its eyesight is worse than I thought.  It couldn't see us.  And it couldn't smell us through the glass.
I think... it means it's full.
Then it won't go after the others?
For what?
How?
Oh God!  Help!
I can't!
Where exactly?
One.
Today.
I thought you were in a hurry.
He gave it back to his father.
The catalyst for the recent dramatic events was of course Truman's father, Kirk, and his infiltration onto the show. Before we discuss that, it's worth reminding viewers that this isn't the first time someone from the outside world has tried to reach Truman.
We find many viewers leave him on all night for comfort.  Haven't you ever watched your child or your lover sleep?
You're the star.
Shhh!
Sure she would.
Guess I always thought they'd adopt.
I figured, what's the point?  I knew I'd just be taking my problems with me.  Once the kids came along, it made me look at Seahaven with new eyes.  I realized, what the hell could be better than this?  I'm telling you.  What you really need is someone to carry on the "Burbank" name.
It's hard to tell.  They look just like regular people.
I went all over but I never found a place like this.  Look at that sunset, Truman.  It's perfect.
That's the "Big Guy".  Quite a paintbrush he's got.
Every time you and Marlon--
--We could bum around the world for a year on that.
And then what, Truman?  We'd be back to where we were five years ago.  You're talking like a teenager.
--we need more charcoal.
So why do you want to go?
Because I never have.  That's why you go places, isn't it?
I think I'd like a little company.
I've got something to tell you.  You'd better sit down.
About time they started cleaning up the trash Downtown.  We don't want to end up like the rest of the country.
Things always do--when you look back.
You can count on it.
We don't even know you.
Well, we're FBI agents.
You were shot in the head. The bullet broke the flesh on your right brow and glanced off your temporal plate.
Yes.
Working with?
Selling naked pictures of little kids over his computer.
Yeah, I did.
Who sent you?
They want to discredit you -- for what?
I picked up the historical document of the venality and hypocrisy of the American government. The daily newspaper.
You said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Why?
According to the newspaper, FEMA had been called out to manage an outbreak of the Hanta virus. Are you familiar with the Hanta virus, Agent Mulder?
What killed those men?
What killed them I won't even write about. I tell you, they'd do more than just harass me. They have the future to protect.
Did you find something?
No. I haven't.
I just did. You're buying.
All I told them was the truth.
Just get dressed. I'll explain on the way.
According to this tag.
I'd been told as much.
What did you find?
Scully -- listen to me. I'm going home, then I'm booking a flight to Dallas. I'm getting you a ticket, too.
It looks pretty green for this climate.
That's the first question to answer, if we're going to find them.
About a hundred miles of nothing in each direction.
That bomb in Dallas was allowed to go off, to hide something: bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself.
Any thoughts on why anybody'd be growing corn in the middle of the desert?
Maybe. Maybe not.
You saved me, Scully.  As different and frustrating as it's been sometimes, your goddamn strict rationalism and science have saved me a thousand times; have kept me honest and made me whole. I owe you so much, Scully, and you owe me nothing.  I don't want to do this without you. I don't know if I can. If I quit now, they win.
I've got no allergy. Something... this... Mulder... I think... I think you should call an ambulance.
On whose orders?
Agent Scully says it was she who ordered you out of the building. That you wanted to go back.
Imagine our surprise when they began to gestate. My group has been working cooperatively with the alien colonists, facilitating their programs. To give us access to the virus. In false hope we might be able to secretly find a cure. So that we might save ourselves, as the last of the species.  Your father wisely refused to believe this, choosing hope over selfishness. Hope is the only future he had: his children,  The only future any of us have.
What about you?
Well, without a cure for the virus, we're nothing more than digestives anyway.
You need not kill a man to destroy him.
And he might blame you for terrifying him.  That one moment could erase all you've accomplished.  And if that happened, the trust he has in you is gone.
I don't want you up all night reading Edward's case file of the nine millionth time.  Balance, dear girl, is the key. Leave the work here.
Why did we stop?
Disorientation, nausea, migraines, hallucinations, insomnia, paranoia.
He needs to be turned over.
Okay.  Let's assume he wanted you to find him, that some part of him hated what he was doing... Most likely, that part is dead.  Schizophrenics with Whalen's Infraction sever all ties with the real world.  I'm sorry, I really am.
I realize that...
No.  Not at all.  From what I understand, he knows I"m here, isn't that right?
That's what therapists are for, right?
You're the shrink, you tell me.
It's hard for me to see Stargher as human, capable of something like "remorse."
Good for them.
I got it.
He's beautiful...
Just graduated law school.  Single mom. Had a two-year-old daughter.
Catherine has a tremendous capacity for empathy.  When we started, there were a number of test subjects - other therapists - who acted as "receivers."  All they did was observe and report.  Nothing more.  But Catherine, she had the ability to feel what was happening.  She understood. And the patient responded.  Edward engaged her in dialogue, took her places, showed her things.  He knew she cared.
I think that's the whole point.
What's wrong?
Sometime yesterday morning.
No.
You're looking well.
Thanks you.  Six weeks off does a body good.  I heard she got the approval to try the reversal with Edward.
That's a secret.
Federal Bureau of Investigation, ma'am. We know all, see all...
Completely unaware.
Grandparents.  Live over in Davis.
Anne Vicksey didn't own a dog.
They're in that fucking thing for forty hours, Gordon.  Four-oh.  He got Julia at seven-thirty last night.  You know what time it is now...?!
Thank you. I enjoyed the play very much.
I'm so sorry, I didn't notice much.
That was the man that brought me some money when Harry died. He said Harry had been anxious at the last moment.
They're forged.
Just another part I've got to learn.
Comedy. I don't play tragedy.
It's just what he used to say.
I shall be all right.
There's something wrong. Did you tell Calloway about meeting Harry?
There's nothing in them.
And my passport?
It wasn't important.
They'll be returned, miss.
Holly Martins.
Oh, stop behaving like a fool, Martins.
Bring him in.
I tell you I heard him running ahead of me.
One can't just leave - please.
Well, look, is there a car here I can use?
I've heard of him, of course, but I didn't exactly know him.
On the modern novel - you remember what we arranged and we want you to talk on the Crisis of Faith.
It's good to see you, Holly.
She's been arrested.
I told the police.
The Roumanian?
How do you do.
Thank you.
Hear the details.
In great pain?
Not the sort of thing I should confess to a total stranger, but you have to break the rules sometimes. Humanity's duty.
What else?
Will we never teach these Austrians to be good citizens. It was his duty to give the evidence.
I thought he'd be here to meet me.
I'm sorry, I don't think so.
Just take it, OK.
Ten dollars. I'll find a way to pay you back. How would you like to know About somewhere special? The perfect beach. Paradise. No one else knows about it. That's got to be worth something. What do you say?
Why not? Thai girls best in the world. Thai food best in the world. Thai dope best in the world.
We think in miles, not kilometers.
I think we're about half way.
It's on an island that no one get to.
Eh - bonsoir.
Then let Him destroy me now. Let Him crush me like the conceited bully He is.  Go ahead. Kill me. Here I am. Do it!!
Who the fuck are you?
Danny, it's true. There were no six million. At most, two hundred thousand Jews died in the camps. And the majority of them were from disease and --
The mystics tried to read the white spaces around the letters. They thought there was a whole alternative language hidden there, with secret, alternative meanings.
How come you don't know it?  How can you say you hate the Jews when you don't know anything about --
I have a job.
You want it to be an event.
"And the words fell apart in my mouth like moldering mushrooms..."
Oh, really?
He's at a home out here.
Do you know it like that? By heart.
Do they?
I don't know. I just want to try it.
Shit...  Did you talk to your mother today?
I didn't realize you cared.
I didn't notice his shoes.... Did your mother know he was there?
No, but deep down, beneath the "tolerance" they learn on television, nothing's changed. The very word makes their skin crawl.  It isn't even hate, really. It's more the way we feel when a rat runs across the floor. We want to step on it. Crush it. We don't even know why. It's a physical reaction. Everyone feels it.
How would you kill him?
I'm trying to figure out where the radical right is going to next....I thought you were the most interesting person at that meeting.
German. Mine, too. So who do you think's given more to the world, the Germans -- Beethoven, Goethe, Nietzsche -- or the entire continent of Africa? Ibos, Bantus, Mandingos...
A poison...?
And? WHat did you notice?
Look at me.  DO I look Jewish?  Look...
Give me a reason not to.
No.
If I tell you, will you pull the story? Not write about me?
To hear them read Torah.
I thought you hated Torah.
This is me.
But I wasn't.
You do it on the inside....
...I want you to do it on the outside, too.
Balint?
Forget Manzetti.... Take on something simple. Something you can actually accomplish.  Maybe he'd be more valuable in the city.
Fine.
Why deprive him of his greatest pleasure?
What kids?...
Number ten.
Here...
You said they didn't have night guards.
They don't. I checked twenty times.... Somebody must have talked.
Who even knew?
So what do we do with the device?
Where?
No, it has to be tomorrow. You won't get this many of them in here for another year. It'll be fine.
Seven-thirty tomorrow evening.
I'm in the rabbinic program at JTS...
What about you? What are you doing? Something strange, I bet.
Four. But no one this important.
So what?
The papers are going to report tomorrow that your colleague, Curtis Zampf, has been a federal informant for the past two years. Do you believe that?
Does he know?
Very much, I think.  But, there's going to be a problem.
What d'you mean?
The mafia!  La Cosa Nostra!
It can't be true!
Italian is practically the same thing.
Will that interfere with my getting maternity leave?  I'm pregnant.
Enzo Molinari.
You'll be lovely, but no thanks.  Jacques, would you do a native dance for me?
Little.  Very little.  And skinny, very skinny too.  That is compared to me.
Sinister is what I'd call it...! Ours is so much cheerful!  Why don't you come and stay with me... There's plenty of room in my suite.
The Mamma's there too.
What are you doing here?
The company asked me to extract everything I could from the wreck; so the divers were trying to get at the engine... and then the boat turned over... in the current... and... look, I fucked up!  Can you help?
You shouldn't even carry cigarettes on board!
... What's your name again?
Enzo drop it, I'll find something.
You're staying at the hotel?
Ah ha.  You finally want to know about women.
The size of the lungs has nothing to do with it!
You say that because you have the title!
I can't.
Yes, thank you.  Intravenous if possible.
We saw each other a little while ago.
Just because... I would have liked to visit the town... See the coast... I don't know anybody... Expect for you.
I'm still here.
Well, then, talk to me some more.
It's me again.
I don't know... it didn't feel right.  I'm going to bed.  I'm tired.
Promise you won't forget me.
Positive, Sir.
What?
Okay... Who'd you meet?
It depends.  He should come up soon.  Unless he's decided to stay for the night.
Hey, it's your Bar Mitzvah. I'm just readin' the Torah portion.
That'll work. Get them out to the Jewish community stat. We got an epidemic on our hands.
Well, then I've got good news for you. We just got word that he'll be making an appearance at the Mall Of America today. I'm sending Esther to meet you there at once.
He's...he's very nice.  But Mrs. Carver, the fate of Hanukkah rests solely in his hands. Please, you have to help me.
Sure. Why not.
I said, yeah, about once a week!
Mom, stop with this already. Of course I love you. You're my mother.
You know my friend Maureen? Her son, the investment banker? He paid for her entire retirement in Boca Raton. What a mench he is. Instead of schleping to save Hanukkah, god forbid you should go back to business school and get an MBA. Maybe then you could send me to Boca, too.
I'll be in my office.
I'm back on the job for the JDL. You hear about that crazy white boy who took over as Santa?
It's cool. It's cool. Aveenooh Shalom Alechem, brother.
Offscreen gunfire. That Jewish Atomic Clock stuff ate up a lot of our budget.
Whoa, whoa there. C'mon Mordechai, is this any way to treat an old family friend? Let's cut out all the unpleasantness. I admit, I went way overboard with the whole Hanukkah thing. Let me make it up to you. How about a peace offering?  Girls.
Hah! Jewish guilt. Well, it won't work on me Hammer. I'm too strong for it.
Maybe he ran out of ammo.
That depends. How much money has he?
But between the time you leave the cant ma and fall into bed in that old truck of yours, what happens, Charlie?
That's just it, Charlie. That's what I'm driving at. You could do anything in that time.
They don't say it to me.
No. I'm serious about this.
Look, Charlie, you didn't do it, and you know you didn't.
I saw Teresa. Maybe I was the last to see her except perhaps her Mamacita and her little brother. I was going past --
) They buried Teresa today and they were hunting the leopard again -- out in the country this time. But they didn't get him.
All men are fools. They like to make a big show -â€ shout and hunt --
You'll meet a rich man and he will give, you money.
I bet you try on my coffin some day -- I hope it "fits just perfect."
Good evening.
It's to remind people of the great tragedy that took place here so that they won't ever forget that a peaceful village of Indians was wiped out by the Conquistadores, back in the 17th Century... A band of monks buried the dead and prayed for them and did penance for their deaths â€”â that's what this procession is supposed to be.
Well, now that you've had your history lesson, I think I'll get on to the museum.
Of course. It's the way any decent man would feel in your position.
I can understand about the cat killing the first girl. Charlie How Come told me. All that noise and those lights -- scared crazy it would do anything. Last night there was nothing to disturb it. Just a little girl alone in a cemetery.
Yes.
It could be. Why would a man kill her? For what? It wasn't robbery. It wasn't a crime of jealousy or passion. She had no enemies.
You, Charlie -- you know leopards. You might have had an old claw around somewhere, and perhaps a bit of hair from the cage -â€ eh?
There's a little museum here in town. They've hired me to run it, We've some interesting exhibits of Indian arts and crafts. It's fun -- and I like living here in New Mexico.
Well, I'm hardly Mrs. Leslie Carter â€”whoever she was. In fact, I'm not even much of a success around here particularly after the backfire on Jerry's little publicity stunt with the leopard.
Thanks.
They do, but -- there are no lights out there â€- they'll just be shadows -â€
Why?
Makes no difference. Get him out!
I thought -- is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight â€”â”walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance this town will never forget!
Look, Kicks, have I ever done anything to hurt you?
Makes no difference.  Get him out.
No. I thought that might be just a little corny.  I want you to lead him in on a leash.
Look, Kicks, how long have we known each other?
The whole town's in a state, Kiki â€”â”doors locked, people huddling together like scared sheep â€”â”nobody on the streets at night â€”â
Maybe I want to feel badly.
I'm no detective. I don't even know how to begin. All I know is I want to do something about all this.
How do you know?
I hated you that day â€- you and your flip talk -â€ with that little girl lying dead.
That might depend on where youâ€™re going.
I am Lawrence, sir. Mr and Mrs De Moraesâ€ majordomo. They are expecting you.
Was it cash, Mr De Moraes?  The Â£1,000. You gave it to him in cash?
Now you are confusing me, Mrs De Moraes.
Disney! How inter...
The question now is whether or not your brother still owns anything, Mrs De Moraes.
The man who sold the boy to your brother.
The Mondrian, room 504. The number is 266 7548, plus the L.A. code...
Uh... Wait a moment, Mrs De Moraes...
I... If you donâ€™t mind, I do not think he matters now. It... Things turned out to be as we thought; Leon was weak. Thereâ€™s no point in delving into his sad life anymore. Now, will you please tell me how much we owe you?
Leonâ€™s not found, your parents worry, talk of hiring help to find him, even mention their manhunter friends perhaps... and Adonis panics, takes control, brings me in reckoning a small- time detective is unlikely to dig up anything awkward, not before Leonâ€™s found anyhow. He must have kicked himself when he learned Iâ€™d exceeded his expectations.
Why do I feel I neednâ€™t answer that?
And you still havenâ€™t told me why you sent me after Friedman.
What happened? Adonis slapped you about a little and you reverted to cowardice?
You wouldnâ€™t understand.
Croissants. Like that...
Iâ€™m fine standing, thank you.
I thought youâ€™d never ask... As I was having my coffee and crescents at the Mondrian the other morning I spotted your photograph in the Los Angeles Times... Thereâ€™s a tough lady, I thought. Just the kind who might help me...
I might come back, I might not. But if I do, it wonâ€™t be for a couple of hours.
Like youâ€™ll find a way to stop your Austrian killing you a second time round?
How come youâ€™re alive? Child traffickers usually achieve what they set out to do.  What am I really looking at here, huh?  Are you really not just a lousy private eye? Am I really looking at some kind of cunning dispenser of justice in disguise?
Yeah. Goodnight, Emily.
Donâ€™t fall asleep with your hair wet.
Route 395. Past Edwards Air Force base and about half a mile before a place called the Red Mountain Motel. Thereâ€™s a dirt track with a â€˜Closed to the publicâ€ sign. It leads to some kind of ranch in the middle of nowhere. If you havenâ€™t heard from me by morning send the cavalry, okay? But not before, you hear?
Iâ€™m finished here and Iâ€™m tired, Emily. You shouldnâ€™t be here. Now donâ€™t make it worse.
I see. How much?
You... Fuck you!
Where are we?
Finsbury Park. Weâ€™re in Finsbury Park.
Where are the kids?
What company?
Iâ€™ll call again.
Itâ€™s not.
You wouldnâ€™t be here if I knew, Mr Lombard. What I do know is that he has not been at work for three weeks. That enquiries to the police and London hospitals have borne no results. And that a check with his bank revealed he has not used his account for four weeks now.
I said earlier that my husband and I are supporting Leonard in his photography, Mr Lombard. By this I mean that since his return from America I have been depositing for him a monthly allowance in an account we jointly hold. So as you see, I did not have to break the law to find out if he used the account.
I presume you checked your sonâ€™s apartment...
Did you look for his passport, driving licence?
Ha... No, Mr Lombard. His monthly allowance is all he is to expect from us. He knows it and we feel the amount is more than adequate.
We conclude our transaction.
Does it matter?
Right now your big friend at the Diplomat is bleeding fast, Martin. He might still possibly survive if attended to soon. And he did cooperate.
Only feeding the disease, eh, Martin?
Huh... Iâ€™m sure thereâ€™d be lots of takers.
Youâ€™re making a mistake, tough guy. Whoever he is, your guyâ€™s not one of Friedmanâ€™s...
The Hyatt...? Whatâ€™s that?
Have you?
I donâ€™t recollect mentioning a friend.
Iâ€™ll be alone.
No! What do you want here? How do you know me?
No sick people in the country, huh?... Just tell me one thing, Rhian. Leonâ€™s story about the boy? You just took his word for it?
Heâ€™d come prepared. He had something besides Shiva... â€˜Sleeping Beautyâ€. The Disney film...  Well, it looked like the Disney film. It was something else. I couldnâ€™t watch...
You sure? What about before he turned up with the boy?
Let me put it this way then; the photographs and the man? One and the same, man, one and the same. At best fucking weird, at worst fucked-up fucking weird. Maybe you should think yourself lucky. Some folks just ainâ€™t worth getting involved with. And Leon sure is one of â€˜em.
Yeah! Somewhere in Wales. I donâ€™t really know her. Used to turn up in a Transit van on weekends, sell old furniture at Camden. Thatâ€™s how come he only laid her at weekends, ha ha...
But maybe you know someone who does. An Austrian, in London, dealing in kids and snuff videos. How many can there be? These people supply to order. He has to be known, reachable.
Who?  I donâ€™t know who the fuck youâ€™re talking about, sunshine.
Five seconds. Then you die.
Huh! Youâ€™ve been around, eh?
So you killed him and went to clean out his hotel room... How did Friedman say he got to know where to find me?
Not even scum like Friedman would go to the trouble of killing a stranger on the strength of one anonymous call.
Thatâ€™s what he said...
Majesty, I can't...
Jeanne's been badly injured!  She jumped from the top of a tower into a frozen moat!
I thought you were an archer?
The King of England.  I want to give them the chance to leave Orleans in peace before I get there.
Alright, whatever -- but since He's not going to come down and cut it himself, at least let someone cut it properly!
No, it's... it's nothing, it's...
Because there's an arrow in your leg.
All you have to do is stop talking and just listen.
You make it sound so simple...
No, but...
To marry you.
I'm staying, Jean.
Jeanne, you can't leave us like this!
You're afraid of displeasing God when telling the truth?!
That is not what is written in the evidence... look for yourself!
Why?
Then perhaps the temptation to kill would have been stronger... too strong perhaps...?
... so you were in the middle of the battlefield, with your sword in your hand, waving it above your head... charging against the enemy, screaming and yelling... fighting for your life... and you want us to believe that in the middle of all this excitement you never killed anyone?
Thirty years ago?  I'm not surprised it's gone...
So long as this bitch remains alive, our armies refuse to fight!  Don't you understand?  They want proof that God is on their side... and the only way they're going to believe that is when they see her being burnt as a witch!
But we can't do that unless she admits to blasphemy...
Scared to make a mistake.  Supposing she's right... supposing she really has been sent by God??
Where... where am I?
And God who allowed you to be caught?
I was talking to the priest, and do you know what he said to me?
Yes.  They paid your ransom... tomorrow you will be transferred to their great castle at Rouen.
I will willingly swear to tell the truth about earthly things, but as for my revelations, I've never told anyone except my king... Charles the Seventh... the one and only king of France.
I will willingly swear to tell you what I am allowed to tell you, but as to the rest, even if you threaten to cut off my head, I still won't tell you.
Did it give you advice?  Good advice?
I -- I can't Jeanne... I can't hear your confession... I'm sorry...
You think?
You did well...
Orleans has held out for six months. I don't suppose a few days will make much difference.  Take some rest.
Peace will only be got from the English at the end of a lance!
Why do you have to be so bloodthirsty?  Do you enjoy it?  All that blood and noise and pain? Diplomacy is far more civilized... far safer... and far cheaper...
What difference does it make where she comes from?
My dear loyal Tremoille, I know I can count on you...
No doubt your captains will fight for your fine cause -- but what about the ordinary soldier?  They don't fight for causes these days. They fight for money.  Who's going to pay them?
If there was, I didn't see it...
His face.
Yes.
I know... but the English want her very badly, and I have to tell you that they are proving much more generous.
Jeanne, with respect -- we can't just attack the Tourelles like that -- it's a very complicated matter and...
We need another ten minutes...
The English won't wait.
Calm yourself, Xaintrailles.  Now slowly.  Who has finally done what?
Yes, it's a miracle.
Good idea...
I don't think.  I leave that to God. I'm nothing in all this, I'm just the messenger.
But the bridge has been pulled down!
No... not like this...
I know, but so is the enemy -- they're falling back -- Paris is ours...!
So when you jumped, you wanted to kill yourself?
Yes, but...
They will -- and so will you if you go on swearing like that.
Were the men confessed?  Where are the priests?
Not for long...
... the smell of victory, Jeanne! Mmmmmmm!  I love it!
A few teeth... that's the price of his life?
Five steeds and a few hackneys...
What about all those dresses you were given... silk dresses weren't they?
YOU THINK GOD ISN'T BIG ENOUGH TO DELIVER HIS OWN MESSAGES?
I might ask you the same question.
What are you doing here?  Please... leave... you can't stay here...
I... I was defending myself as best I could!  Everyone has the right to defend themselves, don't they?  Or should I have let myself be killed?
I agree...
Are you willing to follow all His commandments?
I need to confess again.
Whose were they?
Well no, but... Jeanne, are you happy at home?
Why did she have to die?
It's like this... I...we...all of them.
I'm sorry - I was given this address. I'm looking for a Mr--  -- a Mr Dzikiewicz.
Doesn't it say we have to provide these armbands ourselves? Where will we get them?
American Jews, and there's lots of them, what have they done for us? What do they think they're doing? People here are dying, haven't got a bite to eat. The Jewish bankers over there should be persuading America to declare war on Germany!
Where do you want me to go?  Look at me. No, no, I'm not leaving. Can't I take my chances here?
They're hunting people on the streets. They've picked up Henryk.
Believe me, they've picked him up.
People I know. They said you're an important man.
Of course they'll notice it. But look--  This is a good place for something.
That's better than yesterday.
You're out, aren't you?
Maybe, maybe not, but, Jurek, don't be offended, I didn't call to discuss my future career.
You know what? You treat me like dirt!
Cow!
Dirty pig!
Takes one to know one! Pig!
It's a little cut, nothing.
Warsaw Radio. I was a technician. I saw you almost every day.
Doesn't matter. You've nothing to worry about. I'll visit often.
In the attic.
Well, she was very violent with the gown. She tore off a chunk of lace. if hadn't been there I'd have sworn she'd used her teeth
Oh indeed. Cotton'.
Certainly, there is nothing so easy to like as a pet and they are quite silent.
Yes, it's unholy.
She lives her own life in New Jersey, America.
Yes, I thought that.
Well Baines the music lover, I never would have known. Hidden talents George.
You mean in signs?
What are they?
I'm sorry, I can't do that.  I don't have the time.  Goodbye
They are washed.
I'd rather not play. I want to listen and learn that way.
It's quite safe, they are managing...
Let us not discuss this further. I am very pleased....
Hello.
Play a song then
That's right.
What's the line on Visitation?
7 to 2.  That ain't bad.
You're crazy carryin' that kinda money in this neighborhood.  No wonder you got hit.
How bout you?  I'll give you the whole hundred!
What are you talkin' about?  We just took off the biggest score we've ever had.  We can do anything we want now.
And I'm tellin' ya now, you're a fool if you don't get into it.  A bigger fool than I was.  I been lookin' for this one all my life, Johnny.  Now I got a chance to step out at the top.
Okay, finish your count and get it up here as soon as you can.  I don't wanta be here all night.
Wasn't no problem a mine.
Listen to me, Hooker.  What ever you do, don't go back to your place tonight, don't go anyplace you usually go, ya hear me?  Get outa town or somethin', but...
Yeh, Luther said you could teach me something.  I already know how to drink.
Aw, I conned a Senator from Florida on a stocks deal.  A real lop-ear. He thought he was gonna take over General Electric.  Some Chantoozie woke him up, though, and he put the feds on me.
I don't know.  Haven't seen anybody.
You didn't act much like you wanted to learn it.
'Cause I don't know enough about killin' to kill him.
I thought I'd lost him.
How many guys you conned in your life, Henry?
You wanta wait for your share?
Naw, I'd just blow it.
Nice work, J.J.
Lonnegan.
You scored blood money today, Hooker.  You need a friend.
Yeh, I guess I shoulda had the meat loaf.
She don't work here no more.  I'm fillin' in for a couple days... till I can get a train outa here.
Tomorrow, after 4:00.  Stay inside, I'll come in and get ya.  And be hard on him for a while; he's talking money.
Well we can't talk in here.  They're having the place painted.
Three grand on the black, Jimmy.
I'm a banker, friend.  That's legit in this state.
He's right, Les.
How am I gonna do that?
I'll make parole.
If it works again tomorrow, I'll have a half million in cash here by noon the next day.  We split 60-40.
With 20% coming off the top for me laying your bet.  Either way you end up with 40.
Sure.  Every bunco man in the country knows Gondorff.
There's word he's gonna run a con on the North Side here.  We got a year-old Florida warrant on him, but it's a thin beef, and he can beat it in court unless we catch him cold.  All we want you to do is pick up Hooker for us.
Why don't you pick him up yourself?
What the hell good is Hooker to ya?
No.
Wel-l-l, it seems he has a secretary.
Why did that man want to kill him?
Do you suppose.....  ?
Please!  You can't get mixed up in this.
Go away!
Macaulay.
I've got to see you alone!
Yes.
Take a good look at him, Dad.  Now please try to remember him... 'cause he's going to be your son- in-law.
He can stay home.  Please, Dad, won't you?
We were planning to be married right after Christmas.
Goodbye, my boy.  Take care of Dorothy.  Show her that there is such a thing as a happy marriage.
Going to run him through the fluoroscope?
Must have been in the war.  That might account for the cane and his limp.
He said that father's in town. He's been seeing Julia right along.
She could tell you where father is.
Was there much blood?
Children, will you go into the next room? I want to talk to Chris alone.
Ask him.  I don't know.
Keep on asking.
He's holding out on you.
I'm calling your office so you can send out a man to trail him. I want to see where he goes.
Why didn't you tell me? .... Why didn't you hold him?
Well, thanks.  We'll call you when we need you again.
Tell 'em.
I don't mind telling you I'd rather have you working with us than against us.
That's all I did, Lieutenant. That's the God's truth.  Maybe I said hello to her or how are you or something like that when I saw her, but that's all I knew her. That's the truth.  All right.  Put your mouth in and I'll pop a tooth out of it.
You've said that for weeks.
Why don't you go to see Julia? She handles his money.
Chris!
Just what I said I'd do.
You wouldn't do that...  you wouldn't!
So I see.
He's not anybody.  Just a fellow I used to know.
Go ahead!
Hello ....  give me ....  Well ....  ?
Is Julia going with you?
Hello, Macaulay.  Come in.
Mimi?  ...  Oh, Dorothy's mother.  Does she have to be up to something?
I hate to bother you when you're laid up.
You're always teasing.
I tell you again, I don't want any part of it.  Now you take Dorothy home and...
I'm lot going to stay here to be insulted - 
He's all right. He'd like to see you. But listen...  What's the law doing to me?  Do they think I did it, or is it just something else to pin on me?
She don't say she is, but I figure she is -
Much better, thanks.
Six Martinis.
Six Martinis.  You're not going to have anything on me.
That last Martini.
Too bad you didn't bring your whip.
Can't you get to sleep?
I think I would like that drink.  I'll give you your Christmas present now if you'll give me mine.
Sure -- I don't even feel it.
I'll get some towels. 
You did.
Is that another Christmas present?
Did I give it to you?
Yes.
No reason.  Just a hunch.  But I'm going to find out.  I'm tired of being pushed around.
We're going sightseeing -- aren't we, Asta?
Why shouldn't be close it? He went away.
You mean, he might be hiding there?
I don't know...  This thing has got my goat. I've got to find out.
You bet I wouldn't.
Why, I believe the little woman cares.
Nick!
It was his body that was buried there.
That's a fact.
That's what they think... Guild and all of them.  They take it for granted that it's just another of Wynant's victims.  Guild's hot-footing it around now, looking for Wynant. That's all that troubles him.
No.  Nobody but you.
I want to lie low till I get the whole dope.  I don't want to go off half-cocked.
What are you going to do?
Yes!
Now Nick, what's that got to do with it?
Mimi...
No, Mr. Charles.
Well, that's a hot one.  You a bookkeeper!  When were you ever a bookkeeper?
You his wife?
I'm going to give her a wedding present.  Thought I'd better do it now, before I forget it.  I can drop them on my way to...  That's funny....  Where are those bonds?
I just wanted to tell you...
I'm fired.
Who fired you?
What's in the other direction?
This road, it leads straight to Kuwait.
Oh, God.
Him getting us stranded out here doesn't do much good either.
How tough you have to be to make the army?  All you've got to do is shoot a gun, and stop a bullet.
Should have blown already.  Delayed fuse, that's Vietnam stuff.
Yeah.
Basically.  But the map has been pretty precise so far.  I don't think it'll be too hard to--
I don't know.  There's a lot of space up here.  They could be just about--
I told you; don't push me around.
He...he could have been watching us.
Doesn't matter.  Whatever he wanted he didn't get it.  We've got no need staying around here.  It's light enough.  Let's pack up and head out.
Lot of good you were when I was sinking in the sand.
Just listen to me!  I've been doing some reading.  In the Sixteenth century this region was invaded by the Turks.  It became part of the Ottoman empire.  When the Turks rolled in they raped, they pillaged, the usual stuff.  Anybody who had anything wanted to hide it from these bastards.  They buried their treasures, drew maps, and hid the maps in puzzle boxes.  I read about this, man.  I read about it.
Invest it.
They're not going to--
I'm just thinking, you know, if the rest of the boys knew what we're doing.  I mean if they knew what we were coming back with.
You can't tell anybody about this.
Faster we get there, faster we get back.
Just be cool.
How'm I gonna relax standing on a mine!?
Me and Wes are just going to talk.
Where the hell is it!?
Right now I wouldn't be surprised if Eartha Kitt showed up singing Send In The Clowns.
It's giving.
Is it dead?
I don't see how that plan's any better.
Not when you're up here with the gold, I guess not.
How!?
Forget Wes.
We can't just leave him.
You still got a map on you?
Damn.
You know what I'm going to do?  I'm just going to take a second.  I want to look at the gold.
Probably.
They must be Saudis.  It's a Saudi checkpoint.  Oh sweet, Jesus.  Come on. Come on!
What are we going to do?
I...I never killed anyone before.  I told you that.
We keep going, that's what we do.  We ignore them, maybe they ignore us.
Yeah, but why me?  What if the car doesn't stop?
Don't make so much out of it.  Only reason I haven't figured a way to get all that money for myself is because I've been too busy figuring ways to stay alive.  Believe me; if I had a minute to catch my breath I might have played things the way you and Wes had.  I'm no better than anybody else.  I've just been busier.
How the hell should I know?
Really?
I don't think we'll go to war.  We shouldn't even be here.  This isn't our fight, it's a regional conflict.  It should be decided regionally.
Don't even try it.  You offend a woman out here you're in serious trouble.
What is it?  You know so much about Arabland tell me what it is.
Like I said; so?
They're cancelling all leaves, all passes.  No more drills.  We stand at full ready starting--
What's your point, Wes?  You have a point?
Why would they do all that if we weren't?
Hell, we'll just buy our way out.
A car is not just a car where I come from.  I had this friend, had this wicked candy apple red Sixty-four and a half Mustang--
Oh, God!
Oh, Jesus!
We got to get out of here.
We just about got killed.  You know what happened?  We just about got killed, and you want to go on?
Cortex bonding....possible temporary.  Before you report a possible equipment malfunction, you check the subjects....?
Too low.
When?
Now?
No, don't make trouble.  It's nothing.
Looks like dirt.
Three!  I'm going to be late for my shift.
No!  Don't go.
Promise...please don't THX leaves the room.
What?
They don't know.
I'm not afraid...I'm not afraid.
What are you talking about? When did you sleep last?  Do you know what your trouble is? You're blind.  You've been here so long you can't see what is happening.  We must unite.  We need unity.  We need action. ) We have come to a time when we must....
It seems I am destined to endure many frustrations....but at the same time I am secure in the knowledge that the thrust of my studies has been in the right direction, and that even if it remains incomplete, my search has not been in vain.
Who?  Who's leaving?
No, look!  Three degrees from the central azimuth.
No one could have imagined anything one-thousandth as fantastic as the sober facts uncovered by patient inquiry.  This world is in a state of static-mobility:  we are at the same time moving and standing still.
Don't say that.  You look...  You're not well.
...and you're not lost now?
That way.
Lost SEN!  He'll never find us.
We'll never make it through that mainway...I wonder what happened to SEN.  I'm crazy!  This whole thing is crazy...What am I doing?  My mind is full of so many things I can't think of anything, anymore.  Who are you?
I don't know.
I'm all right THX rises and they begin to walk along the passageway. At the end of the hall is a small metal door, a sign read "Level 842CON G, Division of Plastic, Vendable manufacturing stations" the door is jammed and it is difficult to open.  Finally the latch snaps and the door swings open.
Look more closely.
I did not accept any.  I...  I wanted... to.  But I didn't. You know I didn't.  Don't you?
...rooms with her.  Our relationship is normal, conforming.  We share nothing but space.  What is she doing to...
We just got a bomb threat upstairs.
Patch me through to the Bomb Squad.
Aren't you on suspension?
We can start in the area where the robbery occurred.
With a little training, you could go into a house and just from stuff in the bathroom and kitchen make something that'd finish off that alleged car of yours. Heck, didn't you ever watch MacGyver?
Except they'll blow you up if you don't play along.
Look, it's a longshot...
We've gotta be. In this business, you don't exactly make alot of outside commitments.
Why do you do it?
Where you guys at?
Should we head for the Interstate?
No, I'd slip out past the hotel district, behind Greyhound...
Nothing.
What's wrong?
T.J., run a trace on this, see if you can pin down where it came from. Whoever these people are, let's hope they're all talk.
Hope you don't mind, Captain, might help us catch these guys that much sooner.  Coming?
People are dying.
I know. I warned them.
We're moving' on. I have to pick up the supplies. Just two little boxes.
Shut up!  Who is this?
Maybe she knows your old man.
Insurance?
Time for bed, kiddos. Say goodnight.
No shit. I better send Meg flowers just in case.
It's about this.
Someone who smokes French cigarettes.
Reilly, what the hell happened out there? Why didn't you call for back-up?
Reilly, you're done for now. What the hell were you thinking directing the Bomb Squad Team into hot pursuit. They had no business-
I know.
Yes.
And diamonds in the front.
Yes.
Very well, Jacques.
No.
You've <u>never</u> been in Venice?
But you <u>have</u> been in Venice?
No color, no sparkle--but dependable.
I don't want to see you at all!
Examination! M'sieu Laval, what are you insinuating? I have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. How long have you enjoyed Madame's confidence? Three weeks, I believe.
I was only asking if you are related to the Lavals of Marseilles.
What do you mean?
Just call me Gaston.
Not at all, Countess ... There's one very good stone in it.
But it's not enough!
Beautiful. And what of it?  Let me tell you something: so far as I'm concerned, her whole sex appeal is in that safe!
Oh, no, darling. There's <u>more</u> sex appeal coming on the first of the month.  It's only ten days ...  Eight hundred and fifty thousand francs.
He recognized you!
No--not yet--but--  Two tickets to Berlin--first class and sleeper--night train ... Right ... Right ... Leave them in the name of--Don Ignacio Fernandez ... Right ... Thank you. 
<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.
What time is your rendezvous?
Don't you dare lie to me!  I know you love me.  Well, why don't you say something? Come on--be brilliant. Talk yourself out of it--bluff yourself in!  Shut up, you liar, you!  That's what I want!  This is real! Money! Cash!
Yes.
But really, m'sieu, this isn't necessary.
Please, Madame Colet, I believe in doing things correctly. Shall we continue?  Two hairpins, one cigarette lighter, one box of real matches, and-- Oh, yes, this letter from Major--
Oh!
That's what you need!
Early eighteenth century. I should say around--seventeen thirty.
Beautiful specimen.
Oh? 
Too happy. That's why I discharged her.
Like that?
Any minute I want!
I <u>believe</u> you.
Then why do you want to go?
I wouldn't say anything--I would act.
Then why are you afraid to let me prove it?
Jacques!
Yes! And he would have a little more time for--
For all the really important things--
I beg your pardon!
You should have more self-control. You were in the army.
Yes, I saw it--but--
Five compartments. She can stay afloat with the first four compartments breached. But not five. Not five. As she goes down by the head the water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads... at E Deck... from one to the next... back and back. There's no stopping it.
About half, actually. Rose, you miss nothing, do you? In fact, I put in these new type davits, which can take an extra row of boats here.  But it was thought... by some... that the deck would look too cluttered. So I was over-ruled.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
You know, boss, this happened to Geraldo and his career never recovered.
A hundred and one next month.
Okay, so she's a very old goddamned liar. I traced her as far back as the 20's... she was working as an actress in L.A. An actress. Her name was Rose Dawson. Then she married a guy named Calvert, moved to Cedar Rapids, had two kids. Now Calvert's dead, and from what I've heard Cedar Rapids is dead.
Rose might not want to see this, Lewis.
Don't you mean work me?
How it's going? It's going like a first date in prison, whattaya think?!
This is ridiculous, Lovejoy. Find her.
There are still some boats forward. Stay with this one... Murdoch. He seems to be quite... practical.
It is unsinkable. God himself couldn't sink this ship.
An accident?!
Diamond. Yes it is. 56 carats.
The Heart of the Ocean. Cal, it's... it's overwhelming.
Probably best. It'll be all business and politics, that sort of thing. Wouldn't interest you. Good of you to come.
Almost as good as you.
No, but we're making excellent time.
No you won't.
Well they have some of the coldest winters around, and I grew up there, near Chippewa Falls. Once when I was a kid me and my father were ice- fishing out on Lake Wissota... ice- fishing's where you chop a hole in the --
That's what everybody says. But with all due respect, I'm not the one hanging off the back of a ship.
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Dawson.
That's quite a moniker. I may hafta get you to write that down.
Jack.
Look, I know what you must be thinking! Poor little rich girl. What does she know about misery?
It is that simple.
Yup. That's one of the great things about Paris. Lots of girls willing take their clothes off.
Cal, you can't be serious! We're in the middle of an emergency and you --
Don't be crazy--I'm tickled to death to see you.
This is Miss Marsh.
Lumber, ma'am--spent all my life out there piling up a bank balance--  --and now gosh darn it--"Honest Jack"--that's what they call me--is goin' to see the world.
No!--Did <U>you</U> take that bracelet?
Stick-up. Needed dough to get ashore.
Is that why you killed Lee Lother?
Not at all.
I'll bet a couple of hundred.
That depends on how mother's feeling. You'll excuse me, gentlemen?
Oh--hello!  I got the flowers. That was sweet of you--thank you.
Don't thank me. Do you recognize me without the lipstick?
You're not very ambitious, are you?
Don't be a c-a-t.
Don't rub it in.
Yes--is it all right if I come like this? 
What?--
You didn't?--I guess I forgot to tell you--
I think we ought to walk.
He's a con man--crooked as a tree--and I was part of the racket--helped him!  Now--if you have an appointment elsewhere--I'll excuse you!
What's the matter?
Shortie, look!
Looks like he's taking a trip--see the baggage? The only time they ever picked me up, McKinney walked through the room while they were grilling--let's see how good his memory is.
Come on--  I'll promote a card game, and we'll be sitting pretty.
--there's thousands of 'em!
No, sir?
Change?
That's where you come in. Now, listen, Shortie--
Yes, Mr. Brett--right away.
I'll take one. 
Your mother is feeling seasick and would like to see you right away.
Oh, is she? What a shame!  You'll pardon me?
Sure! McKinney will never suspect you--
No, thanks. I've promised to play cards.
Coming to the pool for a swim?
I'm sorry to hear that.
Your wife knows that, don't she?
Your wife knows that, don't she?
<U>Nuts</U> to you too!
Too bad we're not making a trip around the world-- maybe we could finish this game.  Hey! When you get through with that conference, shoot that last disk!
It's all right--if you like honest faces--let's have another drink--Steward!
Maybe he just travels in bad company.
Why not? I give 'em a great show--and you know-- We're doing capacity, Sally--and all <U>Nice</U> people--
Guess they're dull--nothing for you to reform.
Somebody's got to do it--
Put the whole thing in an envelope and mail it through a porthole--
Everyone but me--what do you want now, Mary?
So have I--I can get it right out of my trunk.
Get that out of your trunk.
No--but I'm going to keep my eye on--
Don't ask any questions--just give it to me.
There's a lot of trout in this stream just waitin' for a fly.  I've already been workin' on a young fellow from Chicago--related to one of the big packin' families--on his way to Biarritz for a good time. Likes a little game of bridge and poker.
Looks lonesome--Bring him over here.
The man that marks them is an artist--two hundred and fifty bucks for six decks--and they're worth it.
Better unlock the door.  Sit up, darling, and be dignified.
I went for four.
Get wise to yourself, Sally--you're no sob story.
You leave the kid alone.
--you'd go with him!
Don't kid yourself--you know how I stand back there.
Let's see if I can bring it back to life.
Why?
Because I was yellow, I guess--
Exciting, wasn't it? Where's Jimmy?
Maybe you will after you've thought it over.
I've got a hunch you're going to win that bet, Inspector.
Do you think Lother could have seen it?
What!--are you crazy?
Hey--you! Where you going?
I saw him take the bracelet out of that shoe.
Because you ran after me.
Now Ed, are we cross?
Oh, so that's it...
He was quoting the bible, Revelations: "Behold a pale horse And the one that sat on him was Death and Hell followed with him."
Ain't our way.  We go all on one, One on all.  Fight one of us, you Fight us all.  That's the Cowboy way.
I know.  Just did what you had to. That banner and stuff, that's Just Ike.  Don't worry about it.
Well... 'bye.
I see, off to strike it rich, Huh.  All right, fine, wish you Luck.  Tell you this though, never Was a rich man yet didn't wind up With a guilty conscience.
Not me.  I'm in my prime.
Ecentus stultorum magister.
I beg to differ.  We started a Fight we never got to finish. Play for blood, remember?
That's good.  I knew it wasn't nothin'.
Not exactly...
Depends how you look at it.  I Mean it's not like anybody's Holding a gun to their heads.
Ignore her?
So what does he want?
Then what do I do?
You know, Stephen Foster.  "Oh, Susanna".  "Camptown Races", Stephen-stinkin'-Foster!
Sheriff, may I present a pair of Fellow sophisticates, Turkey Creek Jack Johnson and Texas Jack Vermillion?  Watch your ear, Creek.
Then why in hell're you doin' This?  You ought to be in bed.
Never even heard of anything like it.
Of course, I'm always happy. Unless I'm bored.  That blonde Woman, is that your wife?
I don't know, doesn't make any Sense.  I almost can't look at You.  Like it hurts.
I hate Sadie.
Don't worry, Wyatt.  My family's rich.
Milt Joyce, owner-operator.
Mattie, they're here!  Folks this Is Celia Ann but you can call her Mattie.  Or even Mrs.  Earp if you Prefer.
All right, well, good night.
You're a Cowboy, you're a Brother.  Come back, no hard Feelings.
Look, I got a rule.  I don't talk To lawmen.  Dog-catchers neither.
But this time they'll be ready.
All right, say you're right, say You don't get yourself killed. There's something else.  It's too late for Virge, he Already rolled his bone.  But it's Not too late for you, Morg.
Remember about the light you're Supposed to see when you're dyin'?
Well I'm real scared.
Listen Mister, I'm getting' tired-
They're nothing.  They're nobody. I want the Cowboys.  All of 'em.  I Mean to break 'em up, drive 'em Out of the territory.
I know, I need a keeper.
Wyatt, they're threatening our lives.
Yeah, and dangerous.
Bring up the tracking satellite. And get 007 out of there.
36 hours. They've already sailed from the Persian gulf.
Yes. I can see: You've hung the rest of your relatives.
Precisely, Mr. Bond. In a matter of minutes, the boring device will arrive at the core of the reactor...  And when the radioactive blades cut into the plutonium -
In the darkest moments, it's what I live for. Especially since I've heard how much you like to watch... On the hidden camera.
Not a clue. I didn't lose the ship.  Next, your new personal communicator.  Picture-phone, fax, beeper.
Occasionally, yes.  British media mogul. Born in Hong Kong; controls newspapers, TV, radio, cable, satellites; books, magazines, movies, computer software. Theme parks.
She married a hockey player.
We work in the dark. We do what we can.
Spends his nights at the Kuala Lumpur yacht club.
Do you have a pen? I just got promoted and don't have my new cards yet.
Three. You? Married?
You too.
Chaperone. I'm waiting for my dinner date.
Listen to me! I'm a British secret service agent. And we have about two minutes before Harmsway kills both of us.
Elliot Harmsway is my Uncle!
What do you mean?
Put your arms around my neck. Lock your legs around my waist.
...You know, that's another reason you're probably not in a successful relationship.
Next time, I do the driving.
And number two?
And when might that be?
Only what I read in the newspapers.
'Able to topple governments with a single story' - as he says in his press.
I understand.
We've already done the interesting part. Do you forget?
I am. What do you want?
What's wrong?
Approaching the first gate.
...Haven't we already paid him for his services?
They're too big.
Soon as I rest a bit.  I meant as soon as we are back to normal again, anytime.
Why are you always afraid to get somewhere?
I told you about calling me boy. I ain't no boy. See, you and Dad got a bad habit of calling me boy. You call me boy in front of my wife. You think I'm going to fix the roof? I hope the wind blows the whole damn thing off and it pours down rain.
You dumb ass, it's Babe Brother.
Harry is coming to pick me up.
I heard his voice as clear as day. I better get back. Maybe something is wrong.
Not anymore, not in the city.
You all act like two roosters.
Just stay in bed and rest.
You must have been really sick.
It hasn't been the years; it's been the men in her life.
Where we come from, you had to know how to act right. You had to know how to say yes sir and no sir. You had to know your place.
He has never gotten rid of the malaria. He is usually up and at it the next day. I'm going to make him fresh chicken broth.
Let me earn my keep. I'll go out and get a hen and have it picked and ready for the pot. Try to make him some cow tea next time.
I know your mother ain't still operating that house of hers.
I think he wants to see your rabbit foot.
No. No. No. No. I had my Child at Cedars and Sinai. And that ain't no county hospital. You have to have cash or check before you come in the door.
What must I do?
Whether the boy hears it or not, the man is still a jackass. Everyone should have some mother wit.
He is in his pigeon cage.
Well, sure, we can leave it up.
You can bring ONE toy...
Just one?
Okay...
Yeah -- when you're sixteen.
Yuk, yuk, yuk -- funny, Mom.
Oh, don't worry, honey, I'm sure we'll find Woody and Buzz before we leave tomorrow.
Oh, great, you found them.  Where were they?
I know Andy's excited about Buzz, but you know, he'll always have a special place for you.
Rocky!  The ramp!
I need to repair my turbo boosters. Do you people still use fossil fuels, or have you discovered crystalic fusion?
Watch yourself!!
Alright, everyone.  You're clear to come up.
Nothing that concerns you spacemen. Just us TOYS.
Sure is a hairy fellah.
Trouble?!  Where?!
Where is it?  I don't see the --
But why would Andy want me?
NO-O-O-O-O-O-O!!
What's with him?
Heh-heh.
Whaddaya mean, you don't know?
She's sick!
Oh, ya big lizard!  Now we'll never know what it is!
I'm sorry.  It's just that I get so nervous before I travel.
A lunchbox...?!
I can't tell.  Hey, where's Lenny?
You are a liar!
Come on.  Let's get out of here.
No, no, no, wait!
Yeah, hey Buzz.  Let's show the guys our new secret best-friends hand shake.  Gimme five, man!
I thought he was at summer camp!
Oh, I don't like confrontations.
That's right.  Your toys.
Uh-h-h-h...nothing!  Uh, nothing. I'm sure Andy was just a little excited, that's all.  Too much cake and ice cream, I suppose.  It's just a mistake.
Slink!  Hang on!
There's not.
I like plaits.
A sin against <i>what?</i>
I didn't know about the puppets. It's a lot to take in, all at once.
Ah, come on now!
He'll be looking for another apprentice.
Finn ...
Victoria -
Sixteen. Well, nearly sixteen.
I can't find Manolo.
Of course he is.  I've known him for twenty years and he doesn't jaywalk...
You're gonna get through it, but the first thing we do is get Michael Adler to represent Carl.  We get Adler and we beat this thing.
Have you gone crazy?  You are not Carl.  You aren't as good as Carl.  They are moving the trial to a high security location.  The press has gone berserk.  The jury will be influenced.  Stay out of things. Let us try to win the case.
I need an introduction to the Obregon Brothers.
What are you thinking, calling me at home with a message like that?  You've compromised me and our relationship --
To begin with, she's only sixteen years-old.
Does this mean you're going to be gone more?
Yeah, well, she has a way of self- medicating that probably seems familiar, too.
Just watching you.
I keep feeling like I'm forgetting something.
Fuck you.  I wasn't doing anything. You're like the Gestapo.
How are your grades?
I get A's.  All A's.
Not like.  It is.
I have dreams about this, actual dreams about busting the top people, the rich people, the white people.
You want to make a wager on this?
She's your girlfriend.  Open it, talk about your kids.
What would a law firm want from the new drug Czar?
Depends on the state.
Not Tiger Woods.
We're playing!
You can't visit me here.  I want my lawyer.
You only got to me because you were tipped off by the Juarez Cartel, who's trying to break into Tijuana. You're helping them.  You work for a drug dealer too, Monty.
I don't know, sir.
Fine, then we don't have deal.
Your new friends.
No, but a lot of other people.  You should come.  You should come out with us.
What is the name of your informant?
What is it you want me to do?
If I ever return to the bench, Counselor Adler, I hope I have the pleasure of hearing your arguments.
I don't give a fuck about your parents --
Apparently not.  Look, it's a shit storm here right now.  When are you coming back?  I don't know what to tell people any more.
Your dad's a doctor.  Call him --
No. On you go.
Bit fucking late, like.
Because I fucking told you to do that, you doss cunt.
Can you not go yourself.
I'd fucking kill you.
Not sorry enough for being a fat cunt.
Ssshh!
No.
It's Iggy Pop.
So long as everyone keeps their mouths shut, we'll not be getting caught.
And what age are you? Thirteen? Fourteen?
Now?
Fuck, OK.
One of Edinburgh's finest schools.
Mr. Murphy, do you mean that you lied on your application?
Sorry about last night -
There's no need.
I'd really rather take care of it myself.
Following the game at all?
Exactly.
Nineteen-sixty-seven.
Eh - Ian Fleming?
And I wondered if you'd care to go to the park tomorrow.
Well, at one time, you've got it, and then you lose it, and it's gone for ever. All walks of life: George Best, for example, had it and lost it, or David Bowie, or Lou Reed -
So who else?
Charlie Nicholas, David Niven, Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley. -
What's wrong, Allison?
Did he -- you know?
You know.
Oh no, don't even mention it.
It was just an idea.
But you don't have the money?
Your favourite dish.
In that case --
As you wish.
Such as sitting in a darkened room, watching videos, drinking, smoking dope and wanking. Does that answer your question?
Are you serious?
Went ballistic?
Big time. Absolutely fucking radge. 'It's me or Iggy Pop, time to decide.'
No. Well, yes. I have to admit it: I'm a perfectionist. For me, it's the best or nothing at all. If things go badly, I can't be bothered, but I have a good feeling about this interview. Seems to me like it's gone pretty well. We've touched on a lot of subjects, a lot of things to think about, for all of us.
All right, we're lost.  But we're making good time.
New course? You have no authority.  What's going on here?
I don't have a clue.
Your orders are to proceed to Nimbus III, assess the situation and avoid a confrontation if possible. Above all, however, get those hostages back safely.
Let us explore it together.
What is it you seek?
Mr. Scott, you're amazing.
I believe Dr McCoy is not in the best of moods.
Perhaps "because it is there" is not sufficient reason for climbing a mountain.
Yes, Spock?
The knowledge and experience he sought were forbidden by Vulcan belief.
Fascinating.
Technically, you are correct. I do not have a brother.
This is a new brig, Captain. It is escape-proof.
That he's found it. Sha Ka Ree. The reason Sybok left Vulcan.
It must be all those marsh melons.
If I activate them now, Captain, we will be propelled upward at an unbelievable rate.
You can't expect us to stand by while you take the ship into the Great Barrier.
No. I refuse.
Am I? We'll see.
The ship needs its Captain.



I know you'll whip her into shape, Scotty. You always do.
Uhura, I thought you were on leave.
And I thought we were supposed to be going together.
No. You must kill me.
Oh. Anything else?
For sure...
Yes, okay, exactement!
Yes.  It felt like Flynn.
It shouldn't be any harder than General Motors was. But now...this is what I get for using humans.
I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then.
That MCP, you know, that's half the problem right --
Alan-One. He calls me... may I pass?
Where did you hear that name?
You know anybody that's got an army for rent, that's fine...but my, uh, User said to go take that sucker out. An' let's face it, the big ox isn't gonna get any weaker. I feel like hittin' him now, while I'm good an' mad. Some nerve... what does he care whether you guys get killed, long as he keeps rakin' in quarters?
I'm sorry, Tron... he's... he didn't make it.
Not with this disk. I'm going to check on the beam connection, Yori. You two can keep a watch out for grid bugs.
Guess I took a wrong turn somewhere...
Almost... I just have to adjust our course at the next junction. I'd better go check the instruments ...
Jump.
Look...just so I can tell my friends what this dream was about, okay? Where am I?
Sure, a little disorientation. That's normal, when they transport you. It'll come back to you. You're doing real well in training. Remarkable, really...
The tower, yes -- Flynn, have you remembered anything else about yourself -- like what sector you're from?
It grows on you.
We're inside a Recognizer...  You are crazy -- stealing a Recognizer --
That's right. He pushed me...in the other world. Somebody pushes me, I push back. So I brought him down here ... What's the matter, Sark? You look nervous.
They'd better be...I don't want to bust outta this dump an' find nothin' but a lot of cold circuits waitin' for me.
So I guess you didn't get away					* for the weekend after all?					*
Yeah.  You know Harry.
Then you better do something to				* jumpstart that man's motor.  You know... wake up the sleeping giant of his passion.
Will you shutup.  I should never have told you about him.
Unbelievable!  Trent told me he wrote it.  He's history.
Alright, I want a complete workup on her.  Do we know where she is?
Uh huh.  Right here in river city.
Okay.  Let's step up the surveillance on her.  Put on two more guys.
She knows not to steal.  I've taught her better than that.
Right.  She's only fourteen.
In her dreams.
Hi, I'm Harry Renquist.  I own a--
Yeah, right.
That's it.  Get 'im Harry  We'll teach that little puke not to signal.
I'll just hang then, shall I?
Something to do with Helen, is what I'm getting.
It can't be.  Not Helen.
What're you talking about?  We have that.
You tell on me, I tell on you.
Whatya talking?  I'm clean as a preacher's sheets, babe.  Clean as a --
There is only one solution to your problem, Mrs. Tasker.  You must work for us.
You're welcome.
Get 'em.  I'll brief them on the way in.
It's show time.  Don't look at					* the flash.  Do not look at the flash.
God!  You have no idea how much that turns me on.  I've never had the courage to say this before but... I love you, Janice.
Uh, yes, it is important.
Oral hygiene?
I'll just be a second.  So what happened tonight at the office?
I couldn't believe it.  I go back to get this report I need, right, and the phone is ringing, so like a bonehead I answer it--
What'd you do, honey?
He wanted me to go with him on a mission, to pose as him wife.
Do you still love your husband?
Think carefully.  You will be lying to the man you love.  The person who trusts you the most.
Harry, be quiet.  Let me handle this.
Oh yeah?  Oh yeah?  Then where did I get this?
Don't call me honey!  You don't ever get to call me honey again. You understand?!  You pig!
My God.  Have you had to...  have sex with other women in the line of duty?
As much as you used to?
No.  Much more.
Absolutely.
Let me think about it.  Hold it a day for me?
He said he was an American agent.
Uh... well, okay then.  You sound terrible.  I'll run out right now.  Just call the prescription in to the pharmacy.  Sure, no problem.  Bye.
I'm Helen Tasker.  Harry's my husband.  And you are?
So now it's Tasker?  Not Renquist?
Something you obviously have a hard time doing!
Hold that thought.
Fuck you.
Okay.  It's just, things are a bit hot for me right now.  If I get a signal...  I may have to leave suddenly.
I'm sorry, I can't.
It's strange.  I knew I was in a woman's thoughts when I was shooting it out with those assassins.
Three of them.  Hardly worth					* talking about.  Two won't bother				* me again.
I just glances inside.
Find out who this Renquist it.
Yeah. I got elbowed right in the eye. And if that wasn't enough, I got hurled the ball when I'm not looking. Wam! Right in my face.
Yeah. I'm fine. It didn't hurt.
Tell me about yourself.
That's where trouble comes into paradise. But the boss let's you borrow some money if you need it. Wanna see what "Spiderman" number one looks like?
At the movies?
Uh-huh, I was tryin' to think of somethin' to say to you, then I thought, she doesn't want me bothering her.
You know, a lot of people have misconceptions of how she died.
Yeah, she OD'd. But wasn't on her last legs or anythin'. She didn't take too much. It shouldn't have killed her. There was somethin' wrong with what she took.
Is he black?
What?
Really?
I been in America all my life. I'm due for a change. I wanna see what TV in other countries is like. Besides, it's more dramatic. Where should we fly off to, my little turtledove?
Live with what?
Yeah.
All anybody saw was Clint Eastwood drinkin' coffee.
Tomorrow.
Get the fuck outta here!
Ask him if he got the letter.
I certainly hope so.
It's difficult because you're sellin' it to a particular group. Big shots. Fat cats. Guys who can use that kind of quantity. Guys who can afford two hundred thousand. Basically, guys I don't know. You don't know. And, more important, they don't know you. I did talk with one guy who could possibly help you.
What's this acting class guy's name?
OK, call 'im up and arrange a meeting, so we can get through all the getting to know you stuff.
Would you just shut up a minute and let me think?
What's to think about?
Yeah?
In case of what?
No, I don't really mean it. Well, I mean, this is our last chance to think about it. How 'bout you, Bama?
I don't blame you.  So we'd both fuck Elvis. It's nice to meet people with common interests, isn't it?
You wanna take me to a kung fu movie?
- that you're unloading for two hundred thousand dollars -
Mr. Donowitz?  I told you, through Dick.  He's in my acting class.  About a year.  Yeah, he's good.  They grew up together.  Sure thing.
Like, look at her. She looks like she fell off an ugly tree and hit every branch on the way down. Elvis wouldn't fuck her with Pat Boone's dick.
Thank you very much, Clarence.
I hear you talkin' Clarence. We park our cars in the same garage.
Don't worry, I'll desire. Boris, could I have some more coffee.
Anything stronger?  Oh, probably not. Beer? You can drink beer, can't you?
Daddy. Nice isn't the word. Nice is an insult. She's a peach. That's the only word for it, she's a peach. She even tastes like a peach. You can tell I'm in love with her. You can tell by my face, can't ya? It's a dead giveaway. It's written all over it. Ya know what? She loves me back. Take a seat, Pop, we gotta talk -
Stop acting like an infant. You're here because you want me to help you in some way. What do you need from me? You need money?
Yes, I still have friends on the force.
Who is he?
Gangster. Drug Dealer. Somebody you don't want on your ass. Look, Clarence, the more I hear about this Drexl fucker, the more I think you did the right thing. That guy wasn't just some wild flake.
Naw, until they hear something better they'll assume Drexl and Blue Lou had a falling out. So, once you leave twon, I wouldn't worry about it.
We do make a cute couple, don't we?
Yeah, well, just stay outta trouble. Remeber, you got a wife to think about. Quit fuckin' around.  I love you son.
No.
I have a son of my own. About you boy's age. I can imagine how painful this must be for you. But Clarence and that bitch-whore girlfriend of his brought this all on themselves. And I implore you not to go down the road with 'em. You can always take comfort in the fact that you never had a choice.
On their honeymoon.
Sure.
What about him?
Sure. No problem.
Absolutely.
No don't sit here and feed us some shit.
Or a bit player -
Krinkle, you're lookin' at the two future cops of the month. We have it, and if I say we, I don't mean me and him, I'm referring to the whole department. Haven't had a decent bust this whole month. Well, we mighta come in like a lamb, but we're goin' out like a lion -
This rabbit'll do anything not to do time, including wearing a wire.
You do.
He knows something's up.
Rock whores.
You ain't seen nothin' like these rock whores. They ass be young man. They got that fine young pussy. Bitches want the rock they be a freak for you. They give you hips, lips, and fingertips.
I tell Jayne Kennedy, "Suck my dick or I'll beat your ass!"
With that terrible mug of yours if Jayne Kennedy told you to eat her pussy, kiss her ass, lick her feet, chow on her shit, and suck her dog's dick, nigger, you'd aim to please.
You're the one who wanted to drive fast.
Naw, they ain't stayin' here. But, I know who you're talkin' about. They're stayin' at the Hollywood Holiday Inn.
Do you know where we can find him?
He's at the Beverly Wilshire.
Then where the hell do you get off talkin' that kind of talk?
Uh, what?
For a man in your position...an opportunity.
You're still a little... disoriented.
Hey, no problem, it's probably just another kidnapping featuring Jeffrey's shrink, pardon me, make that ex-shrink.  This is your leader, a certifiable lunatic who told his former psychiatrist all his plans for God knows what whacko irresponsible schemes, and now who knows what she's painted out there on our wall?
That the virus was taken from Philadelphia to San Francisco, then to New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
So that...???
I need to go now.
Because I'm a good observer.  Because I have a tough mind.
I see.  You don't remember assaulting a police officer...several officers?
Underground.
This is April, right?
You think it's July of 1995?  That's the future, James.  Do you think you're living in the future?
It's the next step.  I checked out the Baltimore information, it was nothing. It's Philadelphia, that's where they are, the ones who killed everyone.  Zs that a radio?  Does it play music?
Everybody's got a gun.  In this city...
I did him a favor.  Now come on.
I've got one now.
No gun!  Stars!  Air!  I can live here.  Breathe!
I thought I was in...prison again.
I don't know -- I don't remember.
It was?  I didn't...know.
A Carpet Cleaning Company?
I couldn't resist.  I was so relieved. Wait'll they hear this nutty woman telling them...they better watch out for the Army of the Twelve Monkeys...
Shh -- don't talk.  Hold still.
Flowers!  What flowers?
So we can stick our heads out the window and feel the wind and listen to the music.  So we can appreciate what we have while we have it.  Forgive me, psychiatrists don't cry.
I mean in my dream -- I didn't realize it was you.  Then...I woke up and I...I thought you were gone.
Who would you call, Mr. Cole, who would straighten everything out?
Scientists.  I'm supposed to report in to them.  They'll want to know they sent me to the wrong time.
Why don't I escape, that's what you were going to ask me, right?  'Cause I'd be crazy to escape!  I'm all taken care of, see?  I've sent out word.
Not as bad as what they're doing to kitty.
Hey, man...
It's about obeying, about doing what you're told.
They gave you a pardon, man.  Whatdaya want?
Your psychiatrist?  Did you just say, "your psychiatrist"?
He's been tested for drugs?
You want to go in?  Examine him?
I'll be right here...just in case.
Might be tight.
What?  What did you say?
Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?
You want something?
Lost my eyes on Okinawa.  Lost them fighting the war.  Fought the war and lost my eyes just so you could come around here and make fun of me.
Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.
I can see just fine.  For example: You're a young man who thinks he's got someplace to be.
Or maybe you just think you do.  You can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, there you are.
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
Think you'll live that long?
We all got plans.  I planned on seeing all my life.  I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
Things ain't always the way they seem. You got to ask yourself; is it worth it?
Next city you're in take it to a jeweler.  He won't give you less than four-hundred for it.
Hundred and eight already.
It is not.
I . . . Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to Mexico?  That's where I have to go.
How much.
I bought a beer.  That was two- fifty.  I bought a beer, otherwise I would have thirty.
You Harlin?
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
Twenty-after-ten.
She's all yours. Put a new hose in it, and she runs like a dream now.
How much?
About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.
It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.
Two-hundred.
Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.
Come back when the sun comes up.
You got the money?
You got beer?
More like Jenny is after every man she sees.
Baby didn't die.  Just froze off all it's finger and toes.  Just a little fingerless, toeless boy now.  But the husband; he sees what the wife's done, so after he saves the baby he locks the wife in the refrigerator to see how she likes it.  Now she died.
Taking a little trip?
What are you afraid of?  I'm the one's got the gun.  Stay here.
I just drove in this morning.
Where you headed?
I pack up and go somewhere else.
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
Those are white words, not ours.
Nothing like a little liveliness.
Such as?
Really?  And what game did you want to play?  You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?
Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they were like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.
Depends on what you call love.  When I was growing up I had nothing.  I learned to want everything.  I wanted more than Sierra anyway. Jake was my ticket.  He's not much; he's older than me, different than me, but he's got more money than half this town put together.  I courted him.  I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line.  I wanted him.  I wanted what he could give me, and I would've done anything to get him.  Is that love?
You could just leave him.
You just walk away.
Whatever it takes.
From here?  I don't know.  Far.  Far enough.
Is it pretty?
Please.  I won't hang on you.  As soon as we get there you can dump me.  I don't care.  I just want to get out of here.
Jake.
We'd have to kill him.
I wanted to talk.
What about us?
Are you sure?  About me, I mean?
What was I supposed to do?
There isn't!  There's nothing under here but more floor.  Jesus fucking Christ!  We killed a man for nothing but floor.
This is good.  This is real good. This is so good they might not even charge us with murder when they catch us.  They'll probably just lock us up for being idiots.
If it isn't here, why would he wear that stupid key?
I told you.  I knew it was there. Didn't I tell you?
The police don't know that.  And it's going to be hard to explain it to them with a noose around your neck.  I'll take you as far as California.  If we can even make that.  After that I'm cutting you loose.
Can you climb back up.
Grace, listen to me.  In the trunk of my car is a rope.  It should reach down here.  Got get it, throw it down and I'll climb up.
I . . I was helping your wife.  I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
I've got to make a stop in Vegas, then I'm heading to Santa Barbara.
I had a problem getting my car back.
You're talking like a mad man.
What makes you say that?
The slimy bastard who's going to do it for you.
Make it twenty.
You're not buying a car, for Christ sake.  You're having your wife killed.  I'm the one who's neck is stuck out.  It's thirteen, or it's nothing.
Is the job done?
And next time, next time somebody is going to get dead.
Trouble with the car again?
Darrell giving you problems?
It's not like that.
I don't blame you.  What man would? I admit it, okay?  I came back here and I made it with Grace.  But if you kill me you're making a big mistake.
Not from where I stand.
You know what kind of woman Grace is.  You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Sierra.  What makes you think when you were planning on killing her she wasn't doing the same for you?  What's she to you, Jake; a woman who would have you dead?  Let me kill her.  All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.
He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.
Not before I settle with you.
Oh, shit!
You stupid punk!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
No.  He gets shot by the old lady.
The old lady?
I had to beat it before the cops showed up.  I don't have a cent to my name.  I can't even get my car out of the garage.  I tell you, Mr. Vesci, if it weren't for bad luck I wouldn't have any at all.  So, I was wondering if you could wire me a hundred fifty-dollars so I could get my car.  I'll pay it back with the rest of the money.
His father worked in a strip mine north of here.  Toby's school class went up to the mine one day.  School takes field trips up there every year.  Big day for the kids when they can see ore tore up out of the ground.  Anyway, on this particular day Toby's dad up and falls into the machinery.
Like I said; you really can't blame the boy.  Some people don't know how to avoid trouble.  Know what I mean?
That's too bad.  I was hoping you were there.  Maybe you could help us catch the guy who got away.  Or maybe you could explain about all that money that got tore up when Jamilla shot that biker.
Not taking a drive, Sheriff. Heading out of town.
Suppose you've had all you can of Sierra.  What with that ruckus you had with Toby.  Oh yes, I heard all about that.
Sure, Sheriff.
There's nothing in the trunk, Sheriff.
Soda.  You got any soda?
Senor, you need a doctor.
You want something, old man?
I'm sorry, I didn't--
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
Your lies are old, but you tell 'em well.
You idiot!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
Give it to me!
Easy, chief. I... I was helping your wife. I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
Accident.
"Bobby Cooper." What brings you to Superior, Coop?
I hope so.  Listen, McKenna about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  Don't be offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics is a free man.  I envy that.  Beside, how can I blame you?  That Grace sure has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she?  Eh?
Would I what?
Be quiet, boy.  I got to figure this thing. I'm thinking. It can't be done at the house. It should be...
Maybe I don't like being played, like she played us today.  Maybe I don't like that at all, Jake. I'm just pissed enough, maybe I'll rip the neck off my own grandmother.
Damn it, Jake. There is a guy coming to kill me, and if it comes down to me or Grace, then I pick Grace.  You were going to give me thirteen-thousand.  Give me two-hundred.  I'll kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it. She showed me the perfect place. There won't be enough left for an autopsy.  But I need the the money.  I've got to have the money.
What are you talking about!
I wanna play a song on the juke.  You got a quarter?
But he's dead.
It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.
Time.
How much!?
Then you ain't gonna have the car.
Listen, Darrell, about that hundred-fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll--
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
What sign?
Listen to me you sorry sonufabitch. You owe me money, and this car ain't going nowheres until I get it.  And if you take another five hours I'll find another fifty dollars worth of work to do on it. Is that clear? Now get out of here 'fore I call the Sheriff, <u>who knows me</u>.
Darrell.
Well, that key's not gonna work. I had to pop the lock. You didn't leave me the trunk key.
Soda.  You know.
That's right on my way.
I like that about me, beautiful.
You sure you can manage?
You're lucky you didn't break down in the desert.  Day like today, you'd be dead in no time. When you leaving?
Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
And here I've made you all hot and sweaty.
I guess I've got wander in my blood.
Cooper. Bobby Cooper. Oh you know, whatever pays best. Little bartending, used to teach tennis, played a little competition ... .
If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
You could leave him.
Don't feel like nothing.
Is it pretty?
Jake hides it. In a safe. In the floor. In the bedroom. He counts it. He loves to sit there and count it.
What about us?
Stop it.
I ... nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell.
I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep and his caddy in the garage. People'll think maybe me and Jake went away.  Buy us some time...I know a back road we can take.
He was in love with you Grace. He would've done what you wanted, you could've made a deal and ...
But we all need that too. Hold him.
I busted my leg!
And that's not the half of it, Mr. Arkadin...
"Arkady"
No, we ain't got no Heineken.  We got Miller.
I'll fuckin' take it. To go.
Sure, I'll try.
What was that all about?
Well it's about time. Looks like you found yourself a helper too.
You never said anything.  About the drapes.
They look nice.
Yes, yes, hit me...beat me, please.
Stay out of this, Jenny.  We got man's business to take care of. I ain't never taken no drugs, mister, and ...
I said come on!
You stay away, Jenny.  I aim to mess him up, and that ain't a thing for a woman to see.
Vat? I am going 5 miles an hour! I am looking town. I not even moving.
Oh.
Ask if he can check how many sick days I've taken since I've worked here?
Do you see any Telletubbies around here?... Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it?... Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression sitting outside in a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put a quarter in it?... No?... Well that's what you see at a toy store? Any you must think this is a toy store, cause you're in here shopping for an infant named Jeb. One of us has made a gross error and wasted the other person's valuable time...
I don't want to drag this out too long for Jeremy.
Not a specific day. What's this about?
Rust?
My turn.  When was the first time the thought popped into your head that we might not make it?
It's finished. I won.
What was your idea Elijah?
Not money.  But I appreciate your healthy cynicism in the manner. It will be wise for both of us to proceed with greatest caution.
One last question.
Yes he is.
I'm going to work out.
What if you only ate foods that were good for you and you worked out everyday for a year?
I mean if you knew karate?
That's great.
I'm not. I just didn't connect it.
What a coincidence? I'm a male synchronized swimmer and I'm looking for representation.
This kid is six foot two, two hundred and forty pounds. He runs the fifty in under six seconds. He's going to be a God.
In the passenger car?
I'm not going out anymore. I'm not getting hurt again. This was the last time. I told you.
Billiards, eh? Even though I don't really wish to play?
'Course he's coming.
Yeah, I guess.
She back in Kansas?
What's all that wood?
Shit, Skinny, we got railroad barons an' cattle barons, but you' re gonna be the first of the billiard barons.
Oh, shit, Bill, I guess nobody's gonna come clear from Texas.
That much, huh?
N-no. I wr-wr-wr-write... I wr- wrwrite...
Uh... Duke.
Duke.
Maybe you should... hang the carpenter.
He hanged him?  Shot him down?
A cowboy come in sayin' you killed Quick Mike in the shit house at the Bar T...
Yeah, I guess so.
For cuttin' up a lady. They cut up her face an' cut her eyes out, cut her ears off an' her tits too.
He's my partner. He don't go, I don't.
You don't recollect!
I got him.
I can't see 'em.
How I said I shot five men... it wasn't true.  That Mexican... the one that come at me with a knife... I busted his leg with a shovel... I didn't shoot him or nothin'.
Well, you don't wanna trust me too much. We'll take Ned his share together so you don't figure I run off with it.
You sure you ain't armed?
Yeah?
Sometimes... yeah.  I don't miss it all that much.
You still think it'll be easy shootin' them cowboys?
Ned... Is that you, Ned?  Ned, I seen... death.
We got to kill this other one first.  Shit, Ned, if we're lucky, we could kill him by nightfall... or maybe tomorrow morning. Then we could head back, all three of us, with the money.
Only he wasn't carryin' no pistol this time.
Before I met your maw, God rest her soul, it used to be I was kinda... wicked... drinkin' spirits an' gettin' into scrapes an' all. Only she made me see the error of my ways an'... I ain't like I was no more.
Thought you was followin' me.
We ain't goin' to Nebraska on no turtle hunt. A hundred yards?
He's blind, for Chri...
Three days? We could kill 'em tomorrow.
I'll ride up close an' shoot 'em!
I've been looking all over for you. You still after the coke that walked out of that blood bath in the harbor?
What was the money for?
He didn't know. No one doing the deal knew except a few key people. This guy says they were real hush about it. Whatever it was it was highly sensitive.
I'm having a stroke.
I love you.
They ruined me tonight.
The word I got is you hung up your spurs, man. What's that all  about?
Yeah, I was gonna tell you to shut up.
County. I was in for fraud.
They're pretty pissed off. They'll do anything. Now I got a way to do it without killing anyone: but like I said, they won't let me in without you.
My employer wishes to remain anonymous.
A strange threat. I can only assume you're here to kill me anyway. Pity about Mr. Redfoot.
A friend of mine in New York tells me you knew Spook Hollis.
Who is he?
Where?
Nothing. Something I - forget it.
I don't think he does. Not exactly, but there's a lot more to his story. I want to know why twenty-seven men died on that pier for what looks to be ninety-one million dollars worth of dope that wasn't there. Above all, I want to be sure that Dean Keaton is dead.
Kobayashi.
Keaton was a piece of shit.
The D.A. gave me immunity.
Convince me. Tell me every last detail. 52    SCENE DELETED                                                              52 53    INT. HOSPITAL - DAY                                                  53                         + Kovash's room is now filled with people. Jack Baer stands next to DANIEL METZHEISER, a balding man in his forties. Next to him is Doctor Plumber. Across from her is Ridgly Waiters.
And this is why you never told the D.A.
What call?
I never heard of him.
THE KIND OF MAN THAT COULD HAVE KILLED EDIE FINNERAN.
This is all bullshit.
Maybe so, but I'm no rat, Agent Kujan. You tricked me, that's all. I won't keep my mouth shut 'cause I'm scared. I'11 keep it shut 'cause I let Keaton down by getting caught - Edie Finneran too. And if they kill me, it's
Counselor, you're insulting me.
Ah.  How did they treat you?
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
No.  Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
How did you settle on the amount?
Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount.  Two Hundred Ten Thousand.  That would mean I keep seventy.
That was our insurance company's recommendation.
... that was a Dr. David Gruber's office ...
I was her doctor.
You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby.  Were you not?
...almost nine minutes...  causing brain damage.
...one moment, Mr. Concannon...
Yes.    It is a crime.  A serious crime.
In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that.  Isn't that right?
...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
Now.  I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed . . . ?
Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago.  Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie.  When were you lying?
I thought I would need it.
... we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.
We just ...
I'm going to have you disbarred. I'm going to have your ticket. You know what you did?  Do you know what you did?
'Code Blue'...
Well...
...apartment.   No, no. Please.  You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they...
I'm afraid that's not true.   Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
Yes...I...yes.
And you wrote that...
Yes?  Galvin, right?
... Deborah Ann Kaye ...
I understand.
Uh, why, why are you doing this?
Then why aren't you testifying for their side?
I didn't do it, Mister.
Who are you protecting, then?
I was held up.
I'm sure you would.
I don't have a week.  This case never should have come to trial. You know better.  You're Mr. Independent.  You want to be independent?  Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you.
What?
I believe that's the law...is it not, Mr. Galvin...?
I'd just like to get to the point, Mr. Galvin.  Let's not waste these people's time.  Answer the question, Mr. Witness.  Please.  Would a nine-minute lapse in restoring the heartbeat in and of itself be negligence?
Damn right I'm done.  I'm going to ask for a mistrial and I'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case. I'm going to take a transcript to the State and ask that they impeach your ass.
I can't guarantee that...
That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...
Yes, we know that you do.  I have it in my files.  That's at the Manhattan Health Center...
I changed my room at the Hotel.
Who says I'm the one that called it off?
That's what I'm going to try to do.
Yes.
I have to talk to you.
He's not in, Sir.
... now who is that ...?
... You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them ...
... hey, I don't need your charity ...
You -- Listen:  you said to me, `if not now, when...'
...he's a good man...
So what do you want me to do? Concannon's going to try the case his way, I'm going to try it mine. You want me to go wee wee wee all the time because he's got some flack, got stories in the newspaper. I'm going to win this case.
Today is Tuesday.  What?
Rooney's protecting someone.  Who is she protecting?
The 'History'...?
My doctor told me that I got to move out West ... that's when we filed in court.  We didn't want to sue ...
She told me.
Yes.
Yes.
But those notations stop...  ...four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
How'm I doing so far?
A huge law firm.  Okay?  They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb.  Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...'  Okay...?
I can give you one thing: he was in love with her.
How long have you been back?
No, I'm all right.
Then?
I'd say you'd better take her to the nearest psychiatrist, psychologist, neurologist, psychoanalyst, or plain family doctor. And have him check you both.
Then you're of no use to me. I'm sorry I wasted your time. Thank you for coming in, Scottie.
I want you.
But she doesn't know, about her background.  She never heard of Carlotta Valdes.
Nothing.
What happened?
What for? Who are you?
My name is John Ferguson, and --
You're not far wrong.
You won't have to.
No, a year ago! Where did you live a year ago!!?
And what will I live on? My oil wells in Texas?
But why?
Judy, you've got to do this for me! Please!
I know. Because I remind you of her. The one that's dead. And not even that, very much.
All right. Then I'll do it. Because I don't care about me anymore. I just want you to love me.
Wherever you'd like...
I'm going to have one of those big beautiful steaks.  And... let's see... to start...
But why? Why here?
Why?
-- and wanted to go on loving you." And I said, "I won't lose you."  But I did.
I'm going to. It's my second chance.
And she was the one who died. Not you.  The real wife.  You were the copy, you were the counterfeit. Was she dead or alive when you got there?
Took no chances, did he?  And when you got there, he pushed her off the tower, was that it? But you were the one who screamed. Why did you scream?
And you were such an apt pupil! What fun you two must have had, playing games with me! Why me? Why did he pick on me?!!
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.
Wandering about.
I shall call you Mr. Ferguson.
Oh, yes! The whole thing must have been so embarrassing for you!
No, I Just thought I'd wander.
Oh... some, two thousand years, or more.
Why?
When?
Vaguely...
What do you remember?
I know.
No. It's new and clean, and waiting.
A portrait? Do you ever see a portrait?
It had to. We're in love. That's all that counts. Madeleine --
Please. Because I love you.  He stares at her, sees the pleading look in her eyes, and lets go. She turns and walks away toward the church, slowly, her head bowed. He watches her go and starts to move after her. Then slowly, as she goes, her head begins to go up until finally, as she walks, she is staring high above her.  And then, suddenly, she breaks into a broken run.
Oh, yes!
I can't imagine that sweet girl with that dear face --
No... she only comes to sit. Two or three times a week. And I never ask questions, you know. As long as they're well behaved. I must say that I've wondered --
I'm having one now.
Aren't you ever going to get married?
I got a call from him today. Funny. He dropped out of sight during the war, and I'd heard he'd gone East. I guess he's back.  It's a Mission number.
He's probably on the bum and wants to touch you for the price of a drink.
Oh, damn it! Damn it, damn it --
I've told you enough.
Mmm, yeah, I guess...
I just thought if I gave you a drink and fed you some dinner, you'd be so grateful you'd take me to a movie.
I thought so!
Yes, it is. Now, I want to look at an evening dress, a dinner dress, black -- short -- long sleeves -- with a neck cut this...  ...and the skirt out. 
Oh, and why am I an asshole?
Franco mother-fucking Harris!
Why was the floor wet?
The hell you do.
The hell I don't.
Eat my ass!
You go home!
I'm not getting a ticket.
Just wait a second. Wait one second. Okay. What are you doing?
Why?
Just stop.
What does that mean?
Oh I did? I think it was your little rat fuck brother who decided to play Hamburger Helper with the hooker's head.
I don't give a damn.
Don't eyeball your kids.
I don't think so.
Yes money. Adam had a five hundred dollar Term Life Insurance Policy.
I don't understand where this personal attack is coming from...
So who's the lucky guy?
What is her disposition?
Who's up for making some real money?
Prison Communication Systems.  An acquaintance friend of mine is professionally involved with a communications outfit in Denver that I just happen to know for a fact is about to be rewarded a very large, exclusive contract to rewire every state prison in Colorado. Yes sir.
Or a stock kick of approximately 125% on shares which are currently sitting around $4.38, or, in plain English...
I'm calling the police.
However it goes, the point is, nobody says anything to anyone ever. Right? ...Right?
Boyd...What have we done?
I just want to get married.
And if you think you can fuck me, don't. Cause I'm fucking insulated Fisher. Protected. Backed up on floppy. Do you get me? I want my fucking money!
I'm a lifesaver. A lighthouse. Up all night in the rain, in stormy gale force wind, tornado and fucking earthquakes. I stay lit for you. I stay lit. I don't go dark. I never go dark!
You need help.
Ball park sausages.
What?
Yes.
I think I forgot the tent.
What?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I forgot the tent. I don't think I forgot anything else.
You expect more what?
You're going to be hungover for three days. Like those guys on "Oprah" that get drunk and have disgusting sex with prostitutes and then say their vows with the stench of cheap hotel whore sex all over them.
Time out.
Keith do not trivialize this.
I'm not. What's the problem?
What kind of seats can we have?
Of course.
That's sweet.
Just a bit of organizing.
I left a message. I think it's going to be okay.
You sound funny. Did you do cocaine?
Nobody's saying cancel. I'm talking about modifying.
I know.
What?
Oh Liz. We. God. We, in Vegas. Micheal crushed her skull. She was dead. There was nothing else to do. It was an accident.
But...
You never walked away dad. You could have walked away.
I'm just so scared of that song. That fucking, "My son just arrived the other day...he says thanks for the ball, come on let's play. I got lots of bills come again next day. He's grown up just like me...My boy is just like me." Gordon fucking Lightfoot, Cat Stevens, whoever, that song just fucking kills me.
I love you so much it hurts. Me and your mother marvel at what you have become. You're going to have a wonderful journey with this girl. I feel it deep inside. A wonderful, magical journey.  And I'm, like I said, just so proud of how you turned out.  You go out and knock 'em dead Keith. Knock'em dead!
I don't hear it.
What?
Greenpeace.
Yup.
I do.
I said out of respect. Respect for you Fisher. For you and your wedding and your beautiful bride. There will be no more rain. You see where I am here?
Give them to Refugio.
Lots. It's got balconies and two big towers.
They're playing games behind the couch ...
That one.
Yes, it is.
Maybe ...
You must listen to me before you go.
Yes, yes, but there's no need to bring that up. How far are you prepared to help me?
Yes.
That's fifteen by seven?
That's it.
Tonight, but I'll be back tomorrow afternoon.
He was asking for it.
Where's the dough?
Why did he kill himself?
But you have a right to let us know what you think.
I'm not like you, you have your wife.
Leave him alone.
You can come and live again in the big house if you want. Now that I'm alone, I can settle down anywhere.
I'll take him to the doctor tomorrow. Come on now, sit down and go on eating. And you, look after him as if he were a sick brother. Be understanding. Now finish eating and then go to bed. Everyone in bed by eight o'clock!
A suicide is horrible. I know. But you should have told me.
Good, then let's go!
I've had a gutful of this.
If you want to stay you'll have to exercise a little self-control, and be a bit more humble to everybody.
That's all right; we all laugh here, but not at you; I'll see to that.
Can you tell us what's on the disc?
Me? What did I do?
He was a computer program for crissake.
I'm getting by.
Don't give up, Parker. Not ever.
Parker Barnes, I'd like you to meet Crime Czar Elizabeth Deane.
You sonâ€”ofâ€”aâ€”bitch. How could you let them put the implant in my head? How?
Don't blame yourself. In your shoes, I don't think I would have told Parker, either.  So do you think Grimes has become the dominant personality?
I need your help--
We have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology. Under the authority vested in me by the President, I'm giving you temporary reâ€”assignment.
You're going to put your theories to practice. I'm sending you into the field.
Trying to find out where the bomb is. Where the hell have you been?
It's already been called off. Witnesses confirmed you weren't the shooter.  Did you find out where the bomb is?
Don't forget, convict, if this psycho isn't stopped, you go right back to rotting in a prison cell.
Don't remind me.
I was assured the problem was corrected.
Do I get to see it or not?
It's better than real. It's synthetic flesh. Synthetic blood. Synthetic organs...  It's a physiological machine.
Amazing. I hate to say it, but it is.
What I need is a nymphomaniac.
What do you expect me to do, thank him?
That's not true, Parker.
What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy?
Charlie? You say that like you're close, personal friends.
Do me one favor â€”â if you shoot at anything, make sure I'm nowhere near it.
Checking my pulse. It's elevated.  You enjoy frightening me, don't you?
I've been in prison, remember?
The government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho.
Who said that?
As a matter of fact, it is.
What does that mean?
Dammit, I hate sounding so clinical all the time. All I meant to say was I thought you were doing well, but then I...
Tell him.
...I think so...You?
More or less.
Then shoot him already.
<u>Lure</u> him. 
Well, well, well, well, wait a minute, we got 86 percent.  We bring'em back <u>tomorrow</u>, the charts go up, they don't go <u>down</u>...
What can it hurt is they offend me.
...twelve years.
...and...
He's not fine.
What rig?
What would do that...?
But, but, but, "they" would find out.
Who's gonna tell'em.
...but...
The Hostages...?
...uh huh...
Now, the Old Lady starts to <u>Weep</u>, Big Bird shrugs off his secret <u>Service</u>, goes to her, and covers her with his own coat.
Find out is there <u>any</u> chance we can get some rain tomorrow, <u>will</u> you...?
<u>I</u> dunno.... Ambassador to <u>Togo</u>, somethin', <u>I</u> dunno... he...
...they just hadn't thought it through...
What are we gonna <u>do</u> about it...?
...what have you <u>done</u> to me...
Hello?   No, operator...
WHERE'S MY FUCKING <u>PIIIILLLLLLL</u>...?
It falls to me to <u>reveal</u> to you a <u>secret</u>.  To reveal the existence of a secret group of warriors. Men, yes, and <u>women</u>, trained and pledged their <u>strength</u>, their <u>skills</u>, and, if called upon, their <u>lives</u>, in the service of their fellow Americans. A group so secret, its very existence has been known to just a few, and known not by a Name, but by a Designation Number, Three-Oh-Three...
ON BREAN, WHO IS DOODLING.
...how ya feeling, boy?
Six to five and pick'em...you wanna <u>chance</u> it...
N'who might <u>you</u> be, when all's said and done?
S'all very well, but when the Fit hits the Shan, somebody's going to have to Stay After School, and who do you 'spose that might be.
There was a group of Girlscouts here from Indiana last month.  One of them expressed an interest in a Frederick Remington bust.  The president took her into the oval Office, for a period...
Dartmouth
Touchdown, Andrews, fourteen hundred, today.
How you going to stretch it?  This won't hold for eleven days.  Guy fucked a twelve- year-old...whadday're gonna do to hold that off?
Uh, <u>nothing</u>, oh, <u>nothing</u> ... uh... a <u>War</u>, uh...  You're kidding.
I never won an Oscar.
N'it's a crying shame.  But you <u>staged</u> the Oscars...
Hey, I know that, hey, I'm <u>kidding</u>...  "It's a pageant"
They got to have something that we want.
No, King, I need you here <u>yesterday</u>...  How long do I need him for?
Ten Days.  There going to be any Back End in this thing?
I gotta protect the Canadian Horder,
Did we ever use those costumes for the Border Patrol? Those guys in the Leopard-Skin <u>Hats</u>?  Here's my idea....
Oh, he's gonna be Aces.
Oh, you're gonna love this:
S'only when you fuck up, everything gets full of shit.  Do you think we could line him up for the Peace Prize?
If they can give Kissenger the Peace Prize, I wouldn't be surprised to wake up and find I'd won the Preakness.
Yes, but there wasn't a War.
...<u>isn't</u> it?  Hey, what-the-hey ... it's all part of the bittersweet...
Ain't <u>that</u> the truth. 
They insist they wanna go with meeting him at the airport.  I told'em they're wrong, I can't convince'em. They're concerned that the last kid had the <u>Wheat</u>. Variations include, the kid is a <u>boy</u>, the kid is <u>twins</u>, it's a little <u>dog</u> ... they rub meat on Schumann's cuff, the dog runs to him...
Yes, William, Uh, we have this <u>thing</u> we're doing...
We'll deal with that when we come to it.  <u>This</u> is producing.  <u>This</u> is what they pay off on...come on, Pal, Boots and Saddles...
He raped a <u>Nun</u>...
No.  You're right.
Leave it flat, will you, Ben?
When do you bring'em back?  Schumann.
It can't be a ribbon cause AIDS had a ribbon, cause the Yellow Ribbon thing had a ribbon, cause...
And what?  What?  She was Driven From Her Home, by Albanian Terrorists.  It is her we are mobilizing to defend... it is "she"?
No problem.  Here's the...

No, I think it's ... can we see the calico <u>kitten</u>...?
Tell those spineless toads we'll self-insure if they don't write it... You fire 33 vice presidents and nothing changes...  You eating twinkies today, Bud, or are you schtupping some stewardess...
It's a romantic and tragic drink.
...takes years of genetics, pal, and a Yale education... and the right tailor.
...not that you learned anything, Chunk.
Hello, Natalie -- guess who? That's right, and you know everyday I say to myself, today could be the day... So what do you say... will you marry me? Then please can you get me through to Mr. Gekko?
Cheer up buddy buddy. You shook Gekko the Great's hand and you still got all your fingers. He's not the only elephant in the jungle.
Marv,  ...I just bagged the elephant!
All right, I owe you one Marv.
That's right, next time a little birdie talks to you, talk to me too E.F. Hutton.
I want to make it up to you. Bluestar, put all your clients in it.
I told you not to go into that racket. You could've been a doctor or a lawyer,
I met them before you were born.
Your responsibility, Dad, is to present the facts, not your opinions, to the men... you're gonna destroy their lives, Dad! Don't do it to 'em. Give it a chance. Let the membership decide for themselves, Dad. Please.
...have a nice day Mr. Stone.  ... Mr. Gekko, the conference call is ready. Mr. Sugarman and Mr. Lorenzo in Delaware. Mr. Bernard in Los Angeles. Mr. Jackson and Ms. Rosco in London. They're all on.
Yeah, check out Teldar Paper, it's still not over.
Come on Buddy, you wouldn't want to got me disbarred now would you?
Alright... I just wanna slow down Bud... no more calls for awhile, no lunches... we suspend our business, alright...
So what firm you with, pal?
...put the rest of it in a money market account for now. I want to see what you know before I invest it...and save the cheap salesman talk, it's obvious.
Inside information. Oh you mean like when a father tells his son about a court ruling on an airline? Or someone overhears me saying I'm gonna buy Teldar Paper? Or the chairman of the board of XYZ suddenly knows it's time to blow out XYZ. You mean that?  I'm afraid sport, unless you got a father on the board of directors of another company, you and I are gonna have a hard time doing any business...
You're walking between the raindrops kid. I expect Sir Larry is choking on his royal chamber pot by now.
You don't understand. I want to be surprised...astonish me, sport, new info, don't care where or how you get it, just get it... My wife tells me you put a move on Darien. Here's some inside info for you. That Euroflash GQ guy she's going with's got big bucks but he's putting her feet to sleep. Exit visas are imminent. So don't lose your place in line.  Oh, jeez, I wish you could see this. The lights coming up over the water. I've never seen a painting that captures the beauty of the ocean at this moment.  ...an old Russian proverb - "a fisherman always sees another fisherman from afar." I like you sport, I ever tell you that... Gordon, call me Gordon from now on.
...Gordon.
I think I got some friends that won't mind making some easy money...
The richest one percent of this country owns half the country's wealth: 5 trillion dollars. One third of that comes from hard work, two thirds of it comes from inheritance, interest on interest accumulation to widows and idiot sons and what I do -- stock and real estate speculation. It's bullshit. Ninety percent of the American people have little or no net worth. I create nothing; I own. We make the rules, Buddy, the news, war, peace, famine, upheaval; the cost of a paper clip.  We pull the rabbit out of the hat while everybody else sits around their whole life wondering how we did it...  ...you're not naive enough to think we're living in a democracy are you, Buddy? It's the free market. You're one of us now...take advantage of it. You got the killer instinct, kid, stick with me. I got things to teach you...
...few thousand dollars down the drain if you ask me.
I gather you're a decorator.
...a Turner, a perfect canary diaiaond... a Lear jet... world peace... the best of everything...
You think I'm gonna broker the rest of my life... I'm going to be a giant, Darien, an entrepreneur in the Italian 15th century sense of the word -- a mover, shaker.
I can stay with the brokerage firm. And you're doing fine. We can survive without Gordon Gekko.
I beg your pardon. Is that a proverb?
Come on, we both like Buddy. But this bleeding heart puppy love act is over the top... It doesn't fit.
The same interest as yours Larry. Money. I thought it'd be a good investment for my kid...
Doctor? Lawyer? CHINA Lawyer, Doctor, I don't care.
A little what? CHINA See.  You don't even speak French.
Allow me sir
No?
A party at a waxwork huh?
Safety in numbers man.
Any student of Black Magic can do it.   .most of these books will tell you how! SARAH So what happens when you've sold out?
One has to keep the distance between `them' and `us'
They're all human beings
When - you're a big boy.  I mean you know it's bad for you
Come on Mark MARK Ah hell, why not.  I'll get the maid to write the essays
I think playing in a band called "Bitch" might put a dent in the whole "perfect family" thing.
Yes it is.  Can we please not do that? Please?  Cause it is.
I know he does.
Yes.  I'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me full of prozac so he can live out his life in peace.
You're joking.
Isn't there something called group hysteria?
You were in an accident?
Who's that?
She isn't here.
I've seen you.  From the window.
Wait!  Don't go...
I should be going anyway.
And so far my day has consisted of taking pictures of my roses for the garden club.
Jody--
Seance.
I mess around with this stuff, but I never thought anything would happen.
Jody, she's alive.
What?
But Claire--
Please.
I had just been left by Richard.  I was bitter and miserable and for some fucked up reason, it made me feel better that your life wasn't as perfect as it seemed.
No.  She wanted me to know the truth.  Now that I do...I think she's at peace.
I have an idea.  But, I mean, I'm just making this up...
Did he say that?
Three weeks.
We'll be quiet.  Quick and quiet.
It's okay if you're not.
Not the focus.
That's not what I'm sug--
It's what I've been working for.
Hurry...
Is it gone?
No.  Can you drive me home?  I'll bring you back in the morning.
Madame Curie, Jonas Salk, Norman Spencer...
That's just mean.  Oh.  Jody wanted to know if I could get her some.
From the sun.  It's a reflection on the glass.
I didn't do that.
Tonight?
...like it never even happened...
Yes.  And he's going to get away with it.
Jody and I.  And she was there, Norman, she was.  It scared Jody so bad she had to leave.
Sabotage?
The accident...?
Claire, please...
Really big bed.
You told me that I was...
What's wrong with me?
STOP IT!
Who?
Huh.
You don't have to do that.
Fine.  I'll do the shopping.
You've been shadowing the family for thirty years.  It's only fitting you give one af us away.
Lasher is my legacy - not Michael's.   Aaron, I've seen the pain in Michael.  I can't bear to see anymore.   He's not to know.  Swear to me.
But why would they do that...?
Who can say the hope of redemption dies with our last breath...? They must see what the legacy has wrought - Diedre, withered inside herself Carlotta, killing and stunting her own flesh and blood...  surely they sense the child you carry - and the life it might lead in Lashers grasp...   Maybe, in death, they feel remorse for the evil they embraced in life...?!
What are you talk---
Nothing worse than a common tool.
This is your aunt.  Carlotta Mayfair.  In New Orleans.
It was quite warranted by the - situation.    I realize this is a shock, but really, Rowan - you never even knew her. It's not as if you've suffered some great -
A very tired one.  I've been up all night - and I would .like to rest before the funeral.     Have your lawyer -
Out of the question      Rowan, coming here will not change the -
Better than most, I suppose.
Now, lasher - it is our time.
He just went out like & light-
I 1ove you, Rowan.  I've always loved you.  I only wanted to be in your thoughts. To bring myself into your thoughts - so I could be as we are now.
It is from love.
I bring her flowers too.
What Michael gives me is stronger than anything you could ever inderstand.
But I could understand. I want to understand!
Do not tell me that!
Only you...
Change me, Rowan, and we can change everything...
I do not understand...
'Kill you...?'  You are my mother.  Do you think I would hurt you...?
Harder...
Then call it in. Mr. Curry. Whatever's happeninq to you - death is not the preferable alternative.  I'm in the life business - remember..?
You know - doors and keyholes are common signposts in out-of-body -
You're not gonna give me the textbook analysia, are you doctor...? My vision was just the chemical reaction of an oxygen-starved brain - and nobody -
And whose houses do you design...?
Really...?  Your family there...?
Just sit there and soak up the vitamin D.
God knows, I'm intriguing.

Listen.  Last night - oh Christ, this'1l take forever to explain. God, Michael...
Goodbye, Michael.   I love you.
Yes.  I love you.  Very much.
It's the next best thing to being there' - right...?
I'm serious.    Whatever it was - it's still there inside me, isn't it - change and all...?
It's alright...it's airight.  He's gone, Michael...  Gone.
I've decided not to open a practice here  I want to set up a research clinic.  For infant genetic disorder.
Tell me BRIAN, what would happen if the client lost the key?
What's with all the locks - and hammering
Don't worry - Is that my hammer  Well Just make sure that it's put back in the garage...
You don't know?
Where do you kill them...
Wonderful - like a great release - He was a malignant cancer and I had to remove him - the world is better without him
Out - I may be some time
I am sorry...
Is LESLIE here?
What's this all about?
You think I'm the WHITE ANGEL?
Get out...
That's crazy talk.
For a guy about to try his first Dom Perignon, you are extremely uptight.
Be cool. Fake it if you have to.
Take a whiff of heaven.
Oh, god.  Look. Look.
These are real, live women?
SHUT UP!  Are you serious? Of course I will...of course.
Makes your shoulders look so big and broad.
That was code for "I like you."
We own a small family grocery store.
We miss you. We miss our son.
We want you to go to college, find a career you love, marry a nice girl from a nice family, and live happily ever after.
The lesson being?
I'm getting so good at this.
They had a rough life. Your father was a bouncer. Your mother was, well, a two-bit stripper. There was no place for a baby.
Like one of those "National Geographic" specials with the topless chicks?
Consider me your fairy godfather, except without the fairy part. No more mealy apples and bruised bananas, ever, for the rest of your lives.
Want a lesson?
Some of them have to be automatics.
I guess...I don't know...I guess we should leave if we're not wanted.
You mean they knew who I was?
Giving you up was the most unselfish thing they ever did. When they founded "Heaven," they wished they could take you back but it was too late. All they could do was build the empire, knowing that someday it would all be yours.
Sheryl Petersen is, what, nine years old, what does she know?
Just a formality.
I miss them, too.
Christy's a very talented journalist. I see a Pulitzer in her future.
Go ahead. Ask her to the prom. Get it over with.
--Do it. I triple-dog-dare you.
Really? You wanna write about me?
I guess.
I bet there are lots and lots of mirrors on Planet Ted.
Why can't you be nice to me?
You're amazing.
He's on the move?
My fantasy is a totally naked woman, wearing nothing but a Timex and suede clogs.
What about you?
Sounds, voices, music, humming. All of it can turn me on, or off, like a switch.
I know, their small town mentality can be maddening.
You're quick. I like that.
You think you're working with chimps here?
Very ambitious. I like that.
I know where you can find any number of naked girls who'd love to hop on board.
Yellow pages?
Just a few tokens of my affection. I'll be back soon, don't worry.
Everything is lovely, Ted, but much too expensive.
Like what?
Have you ever even looked at "Heaven?"
Our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking.
They said that? Really?  Oh, your parents. The Nelson's. Right, right. How midwest. I like that.
I never finished school myself. Never had to. My brother built this empire from nothing but his wife's perky tits and a whole lot of gumption. He gave me a cushy job on a silver platter. I never struggled for a second.
All is fair in "Heaven," Ted-baby.
That's right. And guess who's the new King of the Unemployment Line.
Bad news.
Well kid, I'm speaking of...your biological parents.
I love Antigua.  Maybe I'll come visit you.
I'd like that.
What if something distracts it and it snaps anyway?
Was there ever any kind of investigation...
I know you do.
Take your time.
No.  I've done it a couple of times, I mean with guys I dated.  But this hurt... like, he was built... you know...
I'd like that.
She didn't cone home last night.  We found her car at the bus terminal, but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket.
You have someplace to be?
Why is that?
He dropped Jimmy off first?
And when he arrived at your house, was anyone there?
No.
I worked Juvenile in Dade County for three years.  We had a missing persons on Kelly Van Ryan for two weeks... Maybe a year ago... The family kept it out of the papers.
Suzie Toller's.  And that's the only thing saving your sorry ass.
Yeah, but...
You notice my new jumper?
Where, the mall?
I won't.
Stick?
Then do it.  I need you on this Kelly. Do it tonight.  We'll figure something out... Okay?
There was no way.  That cop would've gotten her to tell him... everything. She was weak and dumb...
Hello.
Yeah, he got her busted for possession...
And you believe her?
No little girl can ever make me come.
Just like that?  These people ruined your life, bro.
Well, you're half right.  Best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me.
That's right.
The bitch shot me, is what happened.
Come on, man.  I'll make a sailor out of you yet.
Are you mad at me?
Well, I'd need the famous Lombardo charm, not that you'd have to do anything you haven't done already.
"Gadget guy?"  While I may not be in a league with these unfortunate geniuses, I am, sir, in my own humble way, a man of science.
Try what?
Potentially.  This is the painstaking process of piecing together clues.  The cornerstone of the modern science of criminology.  Piece by piece we reconstruct the identity of the villain.
My disguise.  And here...
Come on, Jim.  I'm serious.  Dot...  Dash.  It'll be our secret means of communication should we ever need it.
That?  Oh, it's a kind of Chinese fighting... I was sort of caught once with a lovely Chinese girl out in San Francisco.  Her big brothers were kind enough to teach it to me  I've got a book on it, if you're interested.
"Spontaneous."  I like that.  Most people say something like "hare- brained reckless son-of-a-bitch."
Uh... how long ago was this?
It's better than nothing.
There's only seventy-eight.
That's... that's the criminal mind about to stomp our sorry butts!
My Lord, he was telling the truth!
Here.  Mr. Tyler.  He claims a certain skill at handling firearms.
My... the wild west.
I don't like to lose, either.
Really?  Like General Garrison or didn't you hear all that shooting?
I try.  Please, if you promise to protect me, I'll testify against him. I'll give you an ironclad case.
Fine, I'll stop.
Well, Captain, then the answer is your train is still here.
My friend?
Restrain yourself, Voltaire.  He's just the sort of coward who would shoot an unarmed giant.
Has it penetrated yours that I'm holding a gun on their leader?
Call it what you like.  The point is, I was heir to that land, Mr. West.  It belonged to my beloved grandmother!  Now I intend to have it back.  My own country!
So, I'm the only one here who can tell the difference between an Emperor and a murderer?
A Southern gentlemen.  I don't recall his name.  I suppose it's unkind of me to say it, but he had the most disconcerting glass eye.
You're not going to use it, are you?
Least I'm not down there herding sheep!
Gimme a sword, Airk.  I'll win your war for you.
Yes...?
What is Tir Asleen?
My prsence cannot extend beyond this forest.  But I can give you these...
If I'm not strong enough to be your apprentice, how can I do this?
Good.  How long will it take?
You be careful.  I'm a powerful sorcerer.  I could turn you into a toad just like that.
The greatest swordsman that ever lived.
What is it?
I hate this.
Where the hell did you come from?
Nursemaid?!
Because she's sick.
I won't.
You're crazy.  I think you're in love.
No, it's too big to be a Nelwyn baby.  It looks like a daikini...
Absolutely not.
I can't remember all these things. What am I learning?
You didn't transform them, Willow, you released them.  That was noth- ing.  Now change me.
Why?
Somebody has to do it.
Why not?
Without Raziel we'll never find Tir Asleen.  We'd better go.
Maybe milking.
Milking?
John, I don't understand any of this.
...I want to say a thing.
Got to, Sam. You and I are going to a courthouse together, put some people behind bars.
Maybe.
You know who?
You're still convinced there's a link to the department?
If there isn't I've just wasted the last six months.
Well, anyway, don't get crazy.  I'll do something for Zenovich's wife.
You have no right to keep us here.
It's not the gun. Don't you understand... It's you. What you stand for.  That is not for Samuel.
Hochmut?
What else can you do?
There was a time when I would have welcomed it.
There is always a way! But you are such a... a Glotzkopp you cannot see! You'd rather go back to that city! To nothing! No woman! No children! No land!
Let's just find Coalmine.  Listen, Zenovich made a mistake. You didn't let anybody down. It happens â€
You'd lie to protect him.
I admit I don't know where he is.
I don't know where he is.
John said you're Amish.
Yes.
Oh.
His name is John Book.
I have done nothing against the ordnung.
Eh? Nothing? Rachel, you bring this man to our house. With his gun of the hand. You bring fear to this house. Fear of English with guns coming after. You bring blood and whispers of more blood. Now English music... and you are dancing to English music! And you call this nothing?
We'll, them Ohio Amish sure must be different.  Our Lancaster brethren, they just don't have that kind of fight in them.
John, lost control of himself. He... will be repentant.
You're Rachel Lapp, aren't you?
All right, where is he?
My son is out there!
I wish dawdie was with us.
Fifty-seven, fifty-eight --
Oh, but Aunt Em, she hit him over the --
Dorothy.  Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em, darling.
If any!
You'll be hist...
The Wizard - The Wizard - The Great and Powerful Wizard of Oz - Oz - Oz-Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz!
I don't believe you!
All in good time, my little pretty -- all in good time.
That's a good little girl.  I knew you'd see reason.
Oh, now?
Yes.  Say goodbye, Toto.
Then close your eyes, and tap your heels together three times.
Why, it's just like you could read what was inside of me.
Oh, no, I wanted to go along with you.
I said it had poppies on the wall paper! Eh -- she's -- What's this?  Why, she's -- she's putting her hand on her heart -- she's -- she's dropping down on the....
Yes...!
Oh, my!
Well, of course not.  My goodness, what a fuss you're making.  Well, naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are -- Why, you're nothing but a great big coward!
Yeh, it's sad, believe me, Missy When you're born to be a sissy, Without the vim and verve. But I could show my prowess -- Be a lion not a mou-ess -- If I only had the nerve I'm afraid there's no denyin' I'm just a dande-lion -- A fate I don't deserve. I'd be brave as a blizzard --
Yes.
Oh, come on.
Oh --
It may be just a cricket Or a critter in the trees.
I think I'll miss you most of all.
No, No -- I -- I just thought you hurt yourself.
Where's Kansas?
Do you think if I went with you this Wizard would give me some brains?
Witch?  Huh!  I'm not afraid of a witch! I'm not afraid of anything --- except a lighted match.
But I'd face a whole box full of them for the chance of getting some brains.  Look -- I won't be any trouble, because I don't eat a thing -- and I won't try to manage things, because I can't think.  Won't you take me with you?
To Oz?
Come along, Dorothy -- you don't want any of those apples.  Hmm!
Oil can?  Oh -- oh, here it is!
The other side....
It's too late!  There they....
Ah --
I'd show him who was King of the Fores'!
I don't know.
Somebody pulled my tail.
All right, I'll go in there for Dorothy -- Wicked Witch or no Wicked Witch -- guards or no guards -- I'll tear 'em apart.  I may not come out alive, but I'm going in there.  There's only one thing I want you fellows to do.
Now...
She - she can have my Witch Remover.
Wait a minute. This is the left one. He walks bad enough already.
What's she done?  I'm all but lame from the bite on my leg!
Oh, she bit her dog, eh?
Hurry -- hurry --
Emerald City!
Here, Tin Man -- help me.
Oh --
Come on, fellows!
Oh, no!
Yes -- how about Dorothy?
It makes you nervous?
Th.D.?
Makes her look even more innocent.
What would she want with weapons grade plutonium?
I was hoping you could tell me.
Just wanted to put him on edge...
Count to twenty.  Iâ€™ll be there.
How many deaths is he responsible for? How many innocent people? You may only get one shot at a man like Renard. Same circumstances, Iâ€™d do the same again.
Who did you get it from?
Perhaps Sir Robert had a word with the Man Upstairs.
You knew him well?
Yes.
God no. All those horrible loved ones and relatives. I donâ€™t want to talk to those people. I just want to...talk to my father.  I loved him.  Iâ€™m not sure he knew that.
Two. Shaken not stirred.
Not at that price. Time to surrender.
...what?
But you would have something to gain by killing Robert King. And stopping his pipeline.
Sheâ€™s no innocent.  This is my nuclear consultant.
A rope!
Istanbul.
Bond!
Please.
Is it?
You oughta see upstairs.  It's a slaughterhouse.
Oh?  The CTU suspects a Libyan hit squad.
I could stay and go.
I see what the watchmaker made.  I see the universe!
Good night.
Sure.  It works.  I mean, look at this face, Daniel.  I'm thirty-eight years old!
I like the way you look.  It's strange with Jon.  He doesn't age.  His face doesn't change. But you, Daniel, you look . . .
Memory lane.
You and me.
Long as we're on the subject of perverts . . .  I miss Rorschach.  Let's spring him.
Will you two lovebirds keep it down?
Did anybody follow you?  See you come here?
Rorschach, that was a long time ago.  I mean, that -- that's just paranoia.
Hey.  Hey.  If you don't mind, use the back stairs, all right?
Oh sweetheart, just a quick one.
What are you saying?  That Jon is radioactive?
Yeah, I've heard all about your conspiracy theories.  Now I've got a roomful of cameras in there.  I want you out.  Now.  And whatever you're doing, knock it off.  You're making us all look bad.
You're a cold piece of work. You almost got three people killed out there.
You want the cheap backstory? The runaway mom, the suicide dad and the foster homes? Gimme a break. You're not interested in my past, you're interested in my future as some kind of spy.
You're perceptive too. I forgot to add that to the list of surprises. I'm with the National Security Agency. And unlikely as it may sound, I need your help.
I'm gonna be en route with a team shortly to relieve you. Just keep the pressure on until the cavalry arrives. And X? You done yourself proud helping those people today.
Jesus Christ, Gibbons, this is something we came up with?
Kinda funny, though, isn't it? We're not supposed to be making weapons like that anyway. Guess we shoulda played by the rules.
Cut the crap, X, I saw you down there. You're a hero. Don't be afraid to join the good guys.
We're gonna have to step in, Sam. Those CIA boys couldn't find a clown in a field of cactus. Let me take care of it.
How will you fix it?
You wanna find out about rats, ask a rat. I've had my people put together a talent pool. I downloaded it to your desktop.
The scum of the Earth.
But programmable. And expendable.
I think we should send him whatever he wants.
You what? A wire transfer of this size?
Oh, I don't know. It was an accident.
Alright. You wanna eat through a tube, be my guest.
Slick graphics, huh? See these dudes? They're called "Anarchy 99", they're the bad guy bosses.
Nothing, really. My guy is just doing it to stay alive.
My goodness, a word with four syllables. I should get some ice before your brain gets too hot.
Maybe we should start again, yes? I know so little about you, except that you're not what you say you are.
Look at you. You're helping run things now. You're a gangster. I bet that snuck up on you. You woke up one day and you were a criminal.
So why don't you tell me something about who you gather information for. They obviously have very deep pockets. Are you from a rival clan?
Let's just say I'm freelancing and leave it at that.
We could work together. Then maybe we could both get the hell out of here. There's a beach in Bora Bora with my name on it.
A long time ago I learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head. Maybe that's my problem. If you don't feel fear you can do some amazing things, but you can also screw your life up in ways you can't imagine.
What the hell are we doing? We're doing all this together, trusting each other, making plans, and we haven't even slept together yet.
He owns a big industrial complex on the river. He'll launch it from there.
No, it's like a safety. We are going to have to access the manual controls.
It's about your next mission. You need to be debriefed.
I'd forgotten how exciting it is working together.
That one I'm real familiar with.
Yeah, thanks a lot.
Why you dogging me up?
Who you workin' for? What do you do for a living, dickhead?
He's not with us, Xander. He must be with you.
It's all this craziness! It's what we've been living since 99, when we left the Army. One of our brothers died in Grozny and we said the hell with this shit. What for? He dies for what? Politics? Who's politics? Not ours.
Don't forget goatee boy. I greased him up on the diamond run.
Storm.  Try to look for the highest vantage point. From what I can figure, he'll need to gain as much altitude as possible to blanket the island.  It is my feeling that Magneto has to--
Beast.
What are you talking about?
You saw what happened tonight.  You think Magneto won't come after him again.  You think he won't come here if necessary.  This is a school, for God's sake.
No.  I'm...  I don't know if we can do this without Charles.
It's too far.
There's no smoking or drinking on the school grounds.
He's busy right now.
Were you now?
You mutant bastards...
Actually, Magneto helped me put it together.
I'll go.
And what do you do when you wake up to that?
Herr Falkstein -- you must go at once and present Dr. Frankenstein with all the details of his inheritance.  The estate will provide for your journey.
No!
Are you trying to make me look like an idiot?
Yes, sir.
You have your tickets?
Oh, darling -- I'll count the hours that you're away.
Mother's going to help me with the invitations.
Love you! ...Well, why don't we turn in?
Yes, he's a little bit... tilted. Harmless, though.
You've done everything that's humanly possible, Frederick.  Oh, darling, I'm so worried about you -- you need rest.
Of course I am.  Now give me a kiss and say good night like my good boy.
It seems fine.
I don't know what you mean, sir.
This is the only library I know of.
Oh!  I thought it was Dr. Frankenstein.
A piece of what?
You are talking about the gibberish ravings of a lunatic mind.
But, sir...
And do you also say Fro dereck?
What hump?
There wolf!  There castle!
Yes!  When I give the word -- throw the first switch!
This guy means business.
What?
Who are you talking to?
Don't fall for that one.
You're just supposed to repeat what you said.
What d'ya mean "What monster?' You remember...the one we madein the basement.
He's carrying her off now through the woods.
That sound good, boss.
I'll bet it's a doozy.
It's the only way.
How's everything?
Yes, I'm going to set you free.  Is the sedative ready?
For  God's sake -- go on!  Are you trying to make me look like a fool. Sing, you amateur!  Sing!!
That's quite all right.  What is it, dear?
No, thanks!  I want to get right to sleep.
Let me come with you, Doctor, please!  I don't want to stay up here alone.
Oh, Frederick... you're not only a great doctor, you're a great... you're almost a...
A god?
Yes!
Alive!  Look at it.  I have defeated death!
I see what you mean.
There can never... ever... be anything physical between us. You know that, dear.
I know Frederick.
No.  Nor to Elizabeth.
Yes, Elizabeth has hers.
And I have mine.
Ready for Fuchsmachen???
Sounds like visitors.  It's all right -- Frau Blucher will show them in.
Franz!  Help!  Lunatic!
I listened extra careful to your "Stand To" this mornin', Boy. ft was peifecL I couldn't 've done it better meseif, not even when I was Bugler to The Duke Of Wellington.. .now tell me, where did you get that black eye?
From the Cook, Sir They saw me dip your shaving tin in the tea-water this morning, made their tea taste of Lifebuoy toilet soap, they saij Handing him the bottle of gin he purloined earlier. 2t
One Zulu is only one man.. ..and I'm afeared of no one man... but the Zulu, they come in the thousands.... like a black wave of death.... in the thousands.... and them assegais.... stabbing!
Lord Chelmsford seems to want me to stay back with my Basutos.
