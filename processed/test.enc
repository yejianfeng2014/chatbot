C'esc ma tete. This is my head
How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?
Have fun tonight?
Then Guillermo says, "If you go any lighter, you're gonna look like an extra on 90210."
So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig " that's gonna be huge.  And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week.
What do you think?
If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
Daddy, no!
Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present.
The prom?  Kat has a date?
It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?
Never
Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
You the new guy?
So they tell me...
Get out!
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
You just said
You got it, Verona.  I pick up the tab, you do the honors.
I'm on it
I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting.
I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking, but killing yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions.  You're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy.
The people at this school are so incredibly foul.
You think this'll work?
Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
The night I take you to places you've never been before.  And back.
I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.
You're not a big talker, are you?
What's this?
"I'm getting trashed, man." Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?
Okay?
Like you could find one
Why'd you let him get to you?
Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
The Partridge Family?
I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.  And piss you off.
So what's your excuse?
How?
No one else knows
You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was a set-up!
I thought we decided you were going to school here.  At U of 0.
So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
When I go?
I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.
Macbeth, right?
I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron's love is pure.  Purer than say -- Joey Dorsey's.
Touch of the flu.
What's to discuss?
Your Eminence, there is only one way to settle the matter.  And that is to make the journey.  I am ready to risk my life to prove it possible.
If God intended our proximity to Asia, do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world?
Don't you realize your words could be considered heretical?
You don't usually ask.
Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.
My letters of appointment.
Chief says -- how many?
You have to find them, Utapan.  Look what they did!
Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure to teach -- but so serious... Brothers should be raised together, Colon.  Even brothers from different mothers...
Father Marchena!
Colon!
I have to disagree.
In one act of brutality, you have created chaos.  Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us!  All that because of your criminal savagery!
He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
You must be mad...!
Then, what do you suggest, Don Sanchez?
Emil.  Take it easy.  Stay with me.  Sit down.  What do you need?  What are you looking for?
Yes.  Yes, come with me!
I brought you some letters.  It's really fan mail.  Women mostly.  One wants to buy you clothes, another sent a check. Another wants a check.
Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.
That's what he did to me.  He put cigarettes out on me.
Out on my back when I was a small boy.
A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process.  Eddie recommended one.
You better get packed.
Do you have coffee?
Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.
Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?
Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.
Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.
When?
He got my gun!  Motherfucker was filming the whole time!
Tall, short-haired, scary eyes.  Second guy with him was...shorter, with a wrestler's build.  And he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me.
It's your crime scene now.  You can do what you want.
You goin' to the escort service?
Of course.
You wanna talk to her alone?
I don't have a girlfriend.
Hey.  I'm a professional.
There are two bodies found at this point.
Eddie, are you okay?
Hey, honey.
What is your problem?  Why'd you snap at me?  I just wanted a statement.
Well, that's great.
See you later.  Good luck.
Tell him to put his gun down!
Let her go!  Let her go!!
Where's Czech girl?
I have five-hundred dollars.
Did you hear what I said?
Don't speak Russian!
Why should I carry your bag?  I am not a dog.
Oh, shit.  I hate looking at that!
The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to erase it.
Why not?
You are success story?  I am success story!  Why do you say I and not we?
Take your eyes off her, Oleg!  Look.  It wasn't my fault you two were caught.  It's his fault.  Trying to get the bank clerk's phone number?!  I wasn't going to wait!!!
A job?
You outta be ashamed.  Ashamed of yourself.
We're takin' him.  Don't argue!
What's that on your forehead, Max? That's a nice attention getter.
Now that you know him, maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make about him.
This had nothing to do with shoes that didn't fit or my relationship with my father who, as you know, made a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties. These people died because of the criminal actions of my doctor.
I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training.
I don't know. Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure.
I'm at Space Station Five, darling. How are you?
She's in the bathroom.
I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right, Darling?
Oh, thank you very much.
Thank you.
I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
Well, thank you very much for being so understanding.
Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days.
When do we arrive at Clavius?
Thank you.
No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.
I will if I can, Frank.
There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?
Five by five, Frank.
That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need it.
Fuck off.  I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.
I'm tellin' ya, I'm giving you all I know.
I'm candy...
You're done.  End of story.
Try Cates.  And let's talk in private, okay?
Hey, no way.  Take off the bracelets or no deal.
What gang you talkin' about, Jack?
Last night.
It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.
I'm gonna enjoy this ... here, I'll even loan you my badge.
This place don't seem real popular with the brothers.
Maybe I don't like the way you ask.
I been waiting a long time for some money.
Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty, livin' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun.
We split 50-50?
Musta got some primo bondsman.
If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd  just leave town.
What you don't understand is, I don't give a damn about how this thing looks.
We're getting too close ... Cates, what's the matter, you been takin' dumb pills?
What about Luther?
They must have set up a meeting for the morning; Luther left an 8 am wake-up and put up the "Don't Disturb" sign.  He's trading his girl for the money.  All we have to do to grab Ganz is not go blind.
That was quick.
I had it impounded.  Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.
Somebody steals your gun, you're supposed to file a report.
Are you gonna tell me about police procedure?  Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap.
Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?
Bullshit red tape.
I got to wait for a call.
Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
Hey, you know what I really think?
When you start with that attitude... it's like I don't know who you are.
Yeah, Guess it must have been a slow news day...
I didn't get burned, two cops did. Listen, I'll tell you about personnel responsibility.  I like to get the job done right.  And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for shit.
Listen, Goddamn it if you think I'm happy about it, you're nuts. I just gotta take care of a few things, okay?
Hiya, kid.
What makes you think they were lesbians, or as you so quaintly put it, dykes?
When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.
Well, I been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years.  And you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress...
Yeah, old times.
We'll follow you.  Take it slow,okay?
What kind of mission?
Is there anything that can stop it?
What is?
Who?
She was taught to love the life of others... but not her own. You have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live!
Do you love her?
I don't have time... I need to know.
Fuel level 6.03..Propulsion 2x4...
I don't think this is a good time...
What did you say? What did you do?
Where have I heard this song before?
Don't you open your messages?
Which one?
I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how to say "Good-bye", that's all I need.
I'm so very sad.
Isn't that a Z140? Alleviated titanium. Neuro charged assault model?
Perfect, Mr. President.
I have to address the Supreme Council in 10 minutes. Just the facts, General.
Not yet Sir..The only thing we know is it just keeps getting bigger!
How's that? Can you hear me better now?
Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?
Yes, Sir!
Smoking?  I'm not smoking.
Okay, I believe you.
No, I don't, because you're not telling me anything!
Mrs. Christian.
Five thousand now, five thousand on delivery. Two women, one white and one black, as long as they have large breasts. Hard bondage, or course.  Other than that, trusting your artistic interpretation, I have only two stipulations.
He might be interested... but it would mean another five thousand.
We can do that.
I'd rather you didn't.
I'm camera shy.
Where are the women?
Is that him?
You're a dead man.
We do.
Why don't they come to me?
I'm not so sure about this.
I'm gonna kill you.
Don't bore me with that bullshit.
Something like that.
Don't think I won't.
Maybe there's something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place, ever think of that?
Wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature.
Shut up.
What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?
I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?
You're telling me it doesn't get to you?
Pittsburgh?
My husband was the only one with the combination to this safe.  I knew about it, but as far as I was concerned it was none of my business.  Not till now, that is.
Okay...
Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.
She just seemed... depressed... ?
I've got what I need for my report. There is... there is one thing that bothers me though.
What?
No.  You don't have any reason to think that...
You were right.  I didn't find anything.  I'm going to run and get something to eat. Are you hungry?
Hello... ?
She was the kindest, sweetest girl you'd ever want to meet.  Oh, I adored her.  I supposed I always hoped she'd be back.  After a time, all I could do was pray she had moved on to better things.  Can you get this suitcase to her parents, if you think it's appropriate?
No, you may not.
I'm required by state law to inform you that, while it's perfectly legal for you to purchase these items, it is illegal for you to use them for any sort of...
Rick...I can't.
I'm sure they're around.
Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much.  You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life.
Extra money, huh?
Nice neighborhood.
Feeling better now?
Hey...wake up.
I was afraid you weren't coming.
Since when are you such a smart shopper?
Are you alright?
You do good work, Alice.
He sure loves to stay awake.
I've got to write some of this down.
These things are wild...  What do you think?
How is he - ?
You could train someone else.
Perhaps.  But the idea of willingly going to <u>school</u> to spend my <u>life</u> at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder-lizards - I'm referring to War - <u>that</u> strikes me as the <u>worst</u> cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow!
That's enough, Holloway.  I've told you before, wearing boards on your shoulders, and parading with a stiff spine doesn't auto- matically endow you with back- bone - !
So?
But <u>they're</u> not Skipper Neilsen's son!  It broke his heart.  Then when some newspapers called Carl 'the honest, sincere son of a war-mongering father' - Captain Neilsen resigned from the Navy.  Oh, he still keeps his hand in - playing around with projects like the 'Lungfish' - but it broke him, all the same.
You've got to let us try, Skipper --
Here - keep these.  It wants me to come alone.
Course and speed?
You better take Powell and Carney with you --
We're dead in the water.  But it indicates we're moving!
It doesn't seem possible, but - could it be an electrical storm center - ?
Thought you were going to Washington, Skipper.
Huh?
You're sure it's Cyclops?
That's a <u>face</u>???
To navigate, won't you have to... see your way?
My yeoman will show you to your quarters.
We've asked ourselves that - over and over - a thousand times.
Are you alright, Wade?
Evan Twombley, the union boss who got shot. Somebody murdered him.
You don't believe me?
He musta found out. They had to get rid of him. And Jack'll get blamed.
Oh.
Shit! What are we gonna do?
Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.
You think so.
I get it.  No sweat. You'll get yourself a deer and you'll get him dead. And you'll have him by coffee time.
Safety on?
This way.
You gotta be more careful about that shit. Gordon or one of those guys sees you smoking that wacky tabacky around me they'll expect me to bust you. And I'll be outta a job.
Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him.
Musta... How'd I know? What're you doing, playing cop?
Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad?
Break stuff?
I guess they're stupid.
Well, yeah. Sort of. Nothing really mean. Me and my pals, me and my brothers. It was kind of funny then. Stealing pumpkins, soaping windows. Stuff like that.
I bet you did lots of bad things.
It's not that.
Some party, huh? Sorry I lost sight of you. I had to step outside for a smoke. You find anybody you know here? There must be some kids you used to know from school. You want to go tomorrow? See your old teachers? Be more fun than hanging out with me all day.
What? You called Mommy? Just now?
It belongs to Pop.
How about a Big Mac?
No.
Nothing.
You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?
Nothing, I guess. I guess I can wait till we get home. Maybe we'll stop by Wickham's for a hamburger when we get to Lawford. That suit you? You always like Wickham's.
Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing anymore.
Told you the snow was coming down. Take the grader.
At the school crossing. In his BMW. Coulda hurt some kids. I'm gonna bust his ass.
What am I -- a security guard? You hired me, you and your Selectman friends.
What do I have to do for it?
Nothing, Wade, I've been thinking. You don't get enough appreciation around here and it's time we changed things a little.
You? Why?
What's the difference? Take my truck, take a rest -- stop worrying about Mel Gordon. Have you decided what to do with your old man's place -- he going to stay there?
I won't. You interested?
It's just...
How's she doing?
See you tomorrow, maybe.
You don't mean that.
I can see what you looked like as a kid.
What way?
There's another thing I've been thinking about. I don't know how you feel about the idea, Margie, because we've never talked about it. But I've been thinking lately, I've been thinking we should get married sometime. You and me.
Of course! I would've heard.
It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it.
There's a furnace.
You're not using it today?
I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.
I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering, is your husband here?
Well, yes, I'm... I want to say that I'm real sorry about your father, Mrs. Twombley.
Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.
The sign. It looks like it's spelled wrong or something.
I'm not finding fault. It's a good idea, good for you, good for the town. Real modern too.
Jesus, Pop, how can you stand the cold, dressed like that? Where's Ma?
You remember Margie Fogg?
We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her?
Bang!
Wade, it's late. I know you're probably at Toby's, but I'm in bed reading. We got different habits.
You think Jack shot him?
Lillian was here. In Lawford.
Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home.
No thanks. I don't drink.
I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks.
I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one.
You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?
And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.
Well, I never heard that one.
Then you accidentally see your body, or your face, or whatever, and you don't know who the hell it belongs to. Strange. It's the business with the old man, I know, and how incredibly pissed I was at him, and also chasing Jack Hewitt like that, and the Goddamned truck going through the ice, not to mention Margie's being so upset -- one thing on top of another.
Well, you aren't the President, dear.
Yes dear?
Daddy. Daddy, please...
I don't drink coffee.
It's some kind of trick... a preliminary airstrike in response to our troop movement.
How we doing, Colonel?
Aw, man. You're torn up pretty bad out here, sir. Do you have any elevater control.
He's dead then. They must have killed him.
They've got no chutes. They can't control the plane, their engines are failing and they're losing fuel.
I prefered the terrorists.
Can we do that?
They still have the President, it's past their deadline and they haven't called. What do you think it means?
If challenged, our fighters are to state that they are on a rescue mission.
Special Agent Gibbs. You helped do this?
Yes, Mr. President.
You're duty to what? The country you served doesn't exist anymore.
Remarkable aircraft. Remarkable.
Do you have to be so brutal?
Why? Do you enjoy it?
She isn't a part of this. This is between you and me.
Get `em ready.  You... come with me.
May I speak to you for a moment?
Did they say anything about my family?
who can I say is calling?
Yeah, right.
Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the....
IT'S OPEN!
Felt like a large asteroid.
Te...!
There's nothing wrong with me!
Let's relax tonight, just the two of us. I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti.
Elaine, when are you going to realize Simon Kurtz put me in here to get me out of the way.
No goodbyes, Elaine.  Just go.
Elaine, what's going on?
Elaine, I'm going back there.  Just hold onto that stick and try to control this hunk of tin as best you can.
Well, Elaine, this might be it if those guys on the ground don't think of something.
Set!
Women <u>and</u> the space program have come a long way, sweetheart.  But after the wedding, no more complicated computers for my little girl.
Elaine!  Ted's a danger to himself, he's a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the Middle East.
You can do it from up here, Captain.
Will Scraps be able to sit with us, Dad?
How many kids get a chance to live on another planet.
You're sure?
Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur?  Over.
That's how I want them.  Poached.  Over.
That's how dry cleaning works.  Now I'd like to quickly go over the digestive system of amphibians.
You folks need any help?
You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.
Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?
That damn computer has taken over.  I'm getting out.
No.  It's hard to L-A-U-G-H when your father's dying.
Thank you. Cream?
I wish I could fool myself into believing that that's the reason. The truth of the matter is, nobody ever asked me.
Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?
Can't you take a guess?
It's a big building with patients. But that's not important right now. Tell the Captain I must speak to him.
What did he have?
No. No one that I know of.
Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change.
What's the matter?
I love you, Elaine.
That's the way I've always wanted it to be, Elaine.
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
I wanted you to know -- now -- I'm very proud.
Bill! Bill! Good-bye, Bill.
Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.
I'm an airline pilot.  Ah, Clarence, according to my calculations, with this tailwind we ought to be able to make up an additional fifteen minutes over the Rockies.
Excuse me, sir. Would you like some coffee before we serve dinner?
I know... Why don't you hang around for a while, let me entertain you? It's Matt, right?  Now tell me the truth, have you ever... made it... with one of us?
I think you're just a little scared now, about what you might find once the lights go out.  A little scared... and a lot curious.  Maybe more than you want to admit.  But doesn't that turn you on, that curiosity and fear, swirling together?  Think of it as broadening your horizons.
Lay off, asshole.
Yes, I heard about poor Warren. Tragic.
That cop, the human, he was the one who killed Anderson and the driver.
His body was discovered three days ago, in an alley off of Central Avenue, near downtown.
With two BRI Sabot slugs in the chest.
Get the picture?
This is mole.  It's good.
No... I am sure not.  That is why I am so concerned... someone must now be producing it here.  But none of my people know how to make it.  The process was carefully guarded.
Jesus, this is major.  Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why'd you hold out on me?

But there's no more drug.
You think this is the guy who did it?
Who else can I ask around here?
One of the two men was Hubley, right?  What about the other one? Did you know him?
Yeah, right.  Don't push your luck. Anyway, according to the sheet, the guy you nailed outside by the car--
No I.D. on him and -- well, you know, no fingerprints -- so it could be tough.  Your buddies this morning went through the mug book but couldn't make a facial match.
First squad up, on line.  Hicks, get yours in a cordon.  Watch the rear.
Which would mean lots of those parasites, right?  One for each person...over a hundred at least.
Yes.  That follows.
But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.
Yeah, yeah.  I saw the commercial.
That's right.
No good.  How do we know it'll effect their biochemistry?  I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit.  It's the only way to be sure.
Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.
You just try getting a dangerous organism past ICC quarantine. Section 22350 of the Commerce Code.
Now, wait a second --
How may drops is this for you, Lieutenant?
Where are your parents?  You have to try...
GET THEM OUT OF THERE!  DO IT NOW!
...We're coming in.
Sir, the CPU is on-line.
Outstanding.  Then all we need's a deck of cards.  All right, let's move like we got a purpose.
Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like those others.  You'll take care of it won't you, it if comes to that?
Look, you started this.  Now show me everything.  I can handle myself.
Wait a minute.  We'd know about it.
Fuck you.
Man, we're not going to make it seventeen hours!  Those things are going to come in here, just like they did before, man... they're going to come in here and get us, man, long before...
Nine meters.  Eight.
There's a guy on the horn, mom-and-pop survey team.  Says he's homing on something and wants to know if his claim will be honored.
And how are we today?
You promise?
Where is she?
Good morning.
Did you know? Had you heard?
What?
Well, what does it matter to you?
Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants?
Where?
I want to go back to Vienna.
Now?
Yes!
Your Grace, I've got something to tell you. I want to complain about this man.
Do you think that's funny?
Sra-I'm-sick. Sick - kiss I'm - my Kiss my! Sra-I'm-sick - Kiss my arse!
No, this is serious. Say it backwards.
What?
All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that?
What's the matter with you?
Tell them to go!
May I offer you some tea, Herr Mozart?
Wolfi!
What? How can you be so boring? Tea!
Well, ask her!
Yes, my love?
These gentlemen are from Salzburg.
Frau Mozart?
My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come.
I see.
Where's our friend?
I'm paying these people. Do you realize that?
And what do you expect? Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day?
Behold!
Do you know who I am?  This is my daughter. I am Frau Weber. We are favoured guests!
I've heard about you for ages! I thought you must be an old man.
It's such an honour for us to have you here, Herr Mozart. And for Gertrude.
May I try it?
And the result satisfies.
Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism.
What? On one hearing only?
Of course I do. It's very good. Of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch elaborate.
What do you mean, Sire?
Mozart, are you aware I have declared the French play of Figaro unsuitable for our theatre?
Well, yes, I admit it is.
Yes.
I don't know. It's not important. I mean, I don't want pupils. They get in the way. I've got to have time for composition.
You don't have secrets from me.
Isn't that marvelous? We're delighted.
Why didn't you mention it in your letters?
Ah! Here she comes. Fraulein Lorl, good morning.
Ah-ha! Siena macaroons - my favourites. Give my best thanks to the baker.
Oh, yes, sir, all day long. He never leaves the house until evening. He just sits there, writing and writing. He doesn't even eat.
Opera? Opera!
Please don't ask me to go back again. I'm frightened! I'm very, very frightened.
Are you Herr Mozart?
That's right.
Yes, well, it's all good fun.
What is this?
What? The vaudeville, what'd you think?
Look, I asked you if we could start rehearsal next week and you said yes.
And which one of them do you want me to teach?
You won't be teaching this one either. She's my wife.
Dear Mozart, my sincere congratulations.
What exactly are you working on?
It's unbelievable! The Director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music. Pages of it.
But there are those who have power over him. I think I'll take this up with the Emperor.
Did my work please you?
What dead? Who is dead?
I don't have it yet. It's not finished. I'm sorry, but I need more time.
You're so good to me. Truly. Thank you.
Oh no. It is a sublime piece. The grandest operone. I tell you, you are the greatest composer known to me.
Strange!
The Fire.
Yes.
Then why especially does it have to be in German?
Then why doesn't he simply appoint me to the post?
No, but I'm the best.
My dear fellow, the language is not finally the point. Do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre?
Mozart -
Are they?
I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?
Is it true?
Yes.
You mean that play?
Yes.
Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?
Who is she?
And say everything went wonderfully. A triumph-de-luxe - say that! Tell him the audience shouted his name a hundred times.
Oh, by the way, give him this. This is his share. That should cheer him up, eh?
What do you mean, 'how did he look'?
Go about your duties.
Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.
They were lying. There were no witnesses, no escaped lunatic. The whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there.
Surely you're not suggesting...
David has suffered a severe trauma. I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor. If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf, why shouldn't David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf, wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon?
The zoo? Is he rational?
Mr. Kessler?
Yes?
You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler.
Shall I be forced to feed you, David?
Twenty-eight.
Yes, go on.
Hello. You all right?
What?
Now I'm embarrassed.
What do I think? You mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends?
I would think so.
It's silly of you to be apprehensive.
Werewolves simply do not exist.
He's an American, you know. Dr. Hirsch is going to fetch round one of those Embassy fellows to see him.
I think he's a Jew.
Miss Price.
Now see here young man.
Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry. I have absolutely no idea what to say to you.
Some, everyone does.
Where am I?
Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've been traumatized, but Jack was torn apart. I saw him. A man can't do that to someone with his bare hands.
Did you see Jack?
David, please. The police are satisfied. I'm certain that if a monster were out roaming northern England we'd have seen it on the telly.
Jack.
You're not having a good time are you?
I'm talking about a girl you want to fuck, so give me a break.
That's a wolf's head.
Nice looking group.
Right.
No, but he was on the moors.
What's the plan?
This is too much. I can't handle this.
Yeah. Your parents came to my funeral. I was surprised at how many people came.
I was murdered, an unnatural death, and now I walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf's curse is lifted.
You'll stalk the streets of London a creature of the night.
Listen to me! Take your own life, David. It's our only chance.
Nurse!
I wanted to see you.
A monster. I know, I know.
I didn't mean it. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm not even sure it was me who killed those people. I don't remember doing it.
I could hang myself.
No.
Remember the Alamo?
He may have a point, Lieutenant. Two strong boys would be able to defend themselves against one man.
Tom, I never had trouble getting credit from you before. When I was flat broke you gave me all the money I wanted. Now I come to you with a swell deal, and the greatestâ€
What's the idea of turning her down? It sounds like a perfectly safe investment.
Matt?
Yeah.
Charlie!
That is simple, isn't it? I assume you can prove that if necessary.
I don't know. It's all been like a crazy nightmare, Mr. Dickson.
She wasn't to blame, Mr. Dickson. It wasn't her fault. Honest, it wasn't. I begged her to come up. She didn'tâ€
Well, you can. You always could.
Line?
Are the payrolls ready for tomorrow?
Good morning, Mr. Dickson. My wife is much better this morning.
Last night? Er - why - uh, last night . . .
Why - well, Iâ€
Longer.
Good morning, Helen.
Good morning.
Good morning, Mrs. Pembroke.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
Sure, I think it's swell.
Good. I'll take this along with me. Tell Clyde I'll see him tomorrow. I'm sick and tired of the delay.
Get all the big bills in the place. Take them out and get them changed. Get nothing but ones and fives. Distribute them among the tellers. Tell them to take their time. Stall as much as possible. Count and recount the money.
How-do-you-do, Mrs. Dickson.
Why?
The ten dollars.
Yes.
All right, I'm lying. Don't forget you called me a liar.
What time was it, Mrs. Halligan?
What time did you get in?
Gatling! They've got a Gatling!
How'd they --
Bob. I didn't...
"The Fidelity Bank and Trust was robbed on Tuesday by a gang of twenty heavily armed men."
If you'd read about it first, you'd have no problems.
Bob, rip up some bandages.
Missed you, cousin.
What the --
I know it ain't no durned bank holiday!
You're right, sir.
Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank.
You know you're welcome any time!
Yesss, but I was thinking, I could come by, and then take Zee out. Some place near. With other folk. Near. Here.  But out.
Every time I put my head up to hit that Gatling, they try to shoot it off.
Such as?
Hello, Liberty Missoura!
You're doing just fine.
I swear I'll shoot you in your sleep.
You know him?
You ready to stop loafing around with this young lady and get back to farming?
You're looking a bit more spry now that somebody --
Pinkertons. It's the railroad.
And I planned getting you off the hangman's deck --
Gents, we are in the middle of something here.
They're all pinned down. Can't even get to the door.
Shoulda learned with Web. Made it look fun, made it look like an adventure. Got Web killed. Now Jim.
We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms.
You shouldn't be up.
You're sick of my company?
A river pirate.
Arr. Hand over your jewels, Missy.
Smart. Funny. Bossy. Always makes me think she's two steps ahead of me. And big buck teeth.
Jesse, have you ever noticed that when you're trying to charm your way out of trouble, your accent gets all farm boy?
You are a hell of a woman.
Don't swear.
So I'll get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by Thaddeus Rains?
Oh. That's nice to know.  We're going to hang you, you know.
Should have just killed Thaddeus Rains and been done with it.
Thanks.
The Lord is remarkably tolerant of the charitable.  "Jesse Woodson James." Jesse James? The Jesse James?
I like that.
I hope I'm not being too forward.
Thank you, Miss -- ?
Really?
Relax, Alan. The Army has this all in hand. And Mr. Thaddeus Rains will be very pleased with this news. Nothing like a hanging to motivate the populace to relocate.
There's only four of them...
And it is my pleasure to be here.
Yes sir.
How much did they get from the safe?
There are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed.
Listen, you're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me, and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to tonight?
Uh huh.
I'm thinking Dorsia.
Nice?
A facial at Elizabeth Arden, which was really relaxing, then to the Pottery Bam where I bought this silver muffin dish. 
Is that Donald Trump's car?
Yes.
I'm ignoring you.
Patrick. Turn on the Light. He turns on the light.
I'm not so sure about this. I had to go to Emergency after last time...
Yes, darling?
We should do it.
No-I can't take the time off work.
We need to talk.
I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore.
Yes, I am.
Oh God, I can't believe this.
I'm just leaving.
Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?
Are you sure?
I think you should go now.
Yes, naturally.
That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess, Valentino Couture?
That's Paul Owen.
I'm not sure, guy, but I don't think dyslexia is a virus.
It's definitely weak but I have a feeling if we do enough of it we'll be okay.
SHUT UP!
Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what he was canceling or why.
Ummm...what? I didn't hear you.
Come on, you're prettier than that.
Jean?
Oh, I don't know. No, we'll go anywhere you want.
Yes? You're dressed...okay.
Want a bite?
And don't tell me you enjoy working with children, okay?
Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously?
Jean? What?
And don't forget you have a breakfast meeting with Frederick Bennet and Charles Rust at '21.
Patrick? Is that you?
Where are you?
What are I doing?
...to the office this afternoon.
Elizabeth, it's three in the morning.
Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP called simply Whitney Houston had four number-one singles on it? Did you know that, Christie? Whitney's voice leaps across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she's mainly a jazz singer-that it's hard to take in the album on a first listening.
KIMBALL.
Your address?
You sure?
How well did you know him?
He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He... ate a balanced diet.
We were both seven in 1969.
So was I.
Yikes! No. Paul wasn't into that. He followed a balanced diet and-
No.
Had his apartment been burglarized?
No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it.
Absolutely, I'm 100% with you.
Great, yes, I'd like that.
I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.
Marcus?
Cecelia is, well...you know 
Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?
No, Owen.
Is it over?
I can't help it. I feel like they'd do anything to keep their --
You know he's never been anybody's counselor before?
That's what I need to ask you.  You know you can't keep anything from me.
What!
Go where? You can't get away from people like this.
Milo. Why would he --
Milo, you told me those DOJ Agents are all over the place. How could they hope to hide a surveillance post?  And how can you get in there, anyway? With the cameras and the swipe cards --
I can't just walk away!
...Whaddo I do?
Guilt?
Milo?
Not like him, is it? To do a thing like that without telling you. You're not losing your hold on him, are you?
Mr. Barton, do you remember me?
This is the biggest Beta demo in like the history of software. You'd be my partner.
Is it your software?
We could move 'em up here.
It needs a more object-oriented language. This doesn't scale, does it?
Milo. What's up?
I'm sure.
Been thinking about the push mechanism in the handler. And it came over me: it's in the wrong place.
'Have a look?
Let's go.
He was on the verge of something, too. He was gonna show us the next day. He said "The answer's not in the box, it's in the band." Know what it means?
Keep looking.
I wouldn't worry about it. You've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets.
Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code?
Why's that?
Right. But Gary's tied-in to a lot of media conglomerates. Have to be careful who we pick.
We can't just assume they're standing by to receive Skywire 12 months from launch. I'd have to write in an aglet.
Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.
I told Teddy about you.
You could always say you have to go the bathroom.
Does he know you know?
Why?!
Please don't go.
What?
We rented a loft in Sunnyvale.  You know what's the bad part? We can't talk about work anymore. We're competitors! The venture capitalists made us sign like 100 confidentiality forms.
Did you tell Alice?
What d'you mean?
Every geek here's got a thing for Lisa. But that's about the biggest reaction she's had to anybody.
Did you download Corey? In San Jose?
Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina. May I call you Alotta...  Please?
You may.
'Milk, milk, lemonade.  Round the corner fudge is made.  Stick your finger in the hole, And out comes a tootsie roll!'
Thank you, that's beautiful. To your health.
To my health.
Do you mind if I ask you a personal question?
Yes.
I'll tell you all in due time, after we make love. But first, tell me another poem.
I think it was Wordsworth who penned this little gem: 'Press the button, pull the chain, out comes a chocolate choo-choo train.'
Thank you.
Russian Intelligence? Are you mad?
Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.
Yes, well...Agent Kensington will get you set up. She's very dedicated. Perhaps, a little too dedicated.  She's got a bit of a bug up her ass. Good luck, Austin, the world's depending on you.
Yes?
Oh, and Austin...
Thank you, Exposition. Only two things, scare me, and one is nuclear war.
What's the other thing you're scared of?
I'm leaving!  Oh, and Austin?
I've got you, Dr. Evil!
No, man, what we swingers were rebelling against were uptight squares like you, whose bag was money and world domination. We were innocent, man. If we'd known the consequences of our sexual liberation, we would have done things differently, but the spirit would have remained the same.  It's freedom, man.
Have you ever made love to a Chigro?
Sure.
What?
He's too well-protected right now.
I don't get it.
Sorry. Move your hand to the left. There you go. Gorgeous.
I am not.
Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina. I mean, I don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues. You went to her penthouse. It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused... well, jealousy. I'm sorry.
I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?
No, did you use a condom?
Austin, what's your point?
I can explain. They attacked me. Gas came out of her...well, and then they... and I...
One credit card receipt for Swedish- made penis enlarger pump, signed Austin Powers.
I don't even know what this is. This sort of thing ain't my bag, baby.
Everything seems to be in order.
Commander, I have to log it...
Hi.
Hello, Scott. I'm your father, Dr. Evil.  I have a son! I have a son! Everyone, I have a son!  Someday, Scott, this will all be yours.
Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening?
I hate you! I hate you! I wish I was never artificially created in a lab.
Umm, that also has already happened.
I'm proud of you.
You can't judge him by modern standards. He's very much a product of his times. In my day he could have any woman he wanted.
You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
Of course not. I was married to your father.
OK. Well, I just really met my Dad for the first time three days ago. He was partially frozen for thirty years. I never knew him growing up. He comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business.
And how do you feel about that?
Really?
Sir August Merryweather? I was looking for something relaxing. Say, a Tuscan hillside in June?
Of course. Natural weather delivered to your door on demand. Down your phoneline. For limited periods.
Red ...
Nature ...
Fear ...
He said if it vanished, he'd know it was ... you who betrayed him. He took a huge risk. The ultimate test.
People, too.
Father will be your controller. Steed here will show you the ropes.
For starters. Of course I had to kill the Teddy Bears, as well ...
Of course. I planned that, too.
Valentine, listen to me ...
You're mad.
How Wagnerian ... Do you mean to say you've waited all these years because you couldn't create a chip on your own? That would have amused Peter.
Much better.
... Showers followed by sunny periods.
But why? What's the point?
For a man in my position --
No thanks.
You should be dead.  How do you feel?
Strange.
Colonel Crabtree. International Satellite Systems. Formerly of the Ministry.
... And by you, Mrs. Peel. Everything points to you.  No sisters?  No undiscovered twin?
Steed ... !
Orders.
I thought you played by the rules.
Oh, and by the way, I think it's about time you got rid of that chip on your shoulder.
'... in a beautiful pea green boat...'
Who's now vanished.
How did you guess?
Something went wrong. System malfunction. Explosion. Mrs. Peel had a narrow escape. Suspected sabotage. Nothing proven. File still open.
I was hoping you could tell me.
You're getting yourself into terrible trouble, my son. Weather's turning very nasty -- and so am I.
The last one you'll ever see.
Bang-bang ... you're dead.
Denmark makes great Nautilus equipment.
What's Debbie's blue book value right now?
Seventy-five hundred.
Maybe it had something to do.
Mr. Thomerson.
Thanks for the advise, sir.
No, Cole, I...
Cole, listen to me... I've got to tell you...
You know how that makes me feel, Deb? Wanta know how that makes me feel?  Angry, Deb.  Yesss, that's the word, angry. But if he makes you happy, you go right ahead. I want you to be happy, Deb.  No matter what, no matter how angry it makes me, no matter how much it hurts. Be happy, Deb. Be oh, so very, very happy.
But a fabulous cook.
Want to hear something great? Bobbie and Phoebe are throwing me a shower. It's really gonna be fun.
What's the matter?
Good...
Have a good time. Don't make it too late.
Let go of me!
And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.
I don't believe you.
See? And these are not just ordinary party-goers -- there are professionals in this crowd -- I didn't want any of them. You... You're what I want. Understand?
Yes...
This has been quite a night. Here's a thought. Why don't we go home and give our private parts a workout?
Are you sure this is a good idea?
Great bathing suit.
They left an hour ago, pink nuts.
Let's go.
Hookers beat you up?
I want women.
Big problem now. Soon they go to customers.
Is that all the coke in the place?
Welcome, welcome, one and all.
Girls, why don't we go inside for lunch.  Boys, would you mind bringing in that lemonade?
No, Brett, I...
Hey, I'm starved... Let's go get something to eat. We'll bring back food for everybody.
I think you'll enjoy this table.
Now, don't get into any trouble.
What are you going to do about it?
Who?
Nah, not yet. Look, you're my older brother. I need some advice here. What's the deal with marriage? What can I expect?
It's gonna flash, Stevie. We gotta get behind it.
That's Franny. She likes firemen.
Goddamn it, Stephen, lay off!  You stupid dumbshit, you never know when to fucking quit, do you? You ever wonder why your career's in the fucking toilet? Why you're gonna be stuck a Lt. for life?
Let me take the lead, Stephen...
Aw man, Stephen, listen to me...
You stupid son of a bitch! What the fuck are you doing!
Ah, everybody screws up some, Brian. You're working for the toughest Lt. on the job. Saw him once pick up a probie he thought was moving too slow and throw him into a burning building. It's just bad luck you're family.
-- You know what Swayzak would do to the department if this got out? --
I like what you've done with the place.
I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.
-- I was doin' it! I was up there fucking doin' it. You don't know, man, you don't know what I did!
Hey.
What, is it the stairs? Christ, I'll let you win next time.
Dad's way? Where did he tell you that? In a fucking seance?
Hey, what are you doing here?
Not quite. Just visiting. I live in Lincoln Park now.
Really? No kidding.
Brian, do you always have to be so stupid? Think about your future for once.
So now you suddenly care about my future?
I could use a date.
Homey.
Brian. What's wrong?
Let me ask you something, do you really think Marty had you assigned to arson because of your firefighting skills? Who the hell are you kidding? I was there, remember? I saw you and your brother --
I think your boss is going to need some spin control.
What'll you do?
Okay, here's the deal. I'll tell you a story, you tell me one. Fair?
That's a probie answer. You're smarter than that, Brian.
Who the fuck is doing this?
What reason?
I've got three different drafts of the same report -- with different numbers that're all over the place. Looks like they were just making it up as they went along.
Well Brian, I guess you can say it's arson now...
Yeah.
Four months.
Well that's two things to strangle Stephen for. Where is he, anyway?
Oh, man, I'm sorry.
No need to be modest, Brian.
Brian, let me come to the point. I'd like to offer you a job.
This one's still with the fire department. One of our best investigators, Don Rimgale, is working on a very difficult, visible case right now. We think he could use another pair of hands and you're exactly the kind of guy I want representing us: An authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan.
Lucky guess.  And a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments.
Lots of fires. They promote faster there. Take a look at the last Lt.'s list, half the guys on it came from that battalion. Gotta think about your future, Timmy. 115's the station.
There's no replacement 'cause of your boss' cuts, if that's what you mean. If someone else goes out on an injury we're really screwed.
Firehouse.
They're waitin' man.
He's got piano lessons.
The great communicator.
Ah Stephen, that's what this is really about, isn't it? You always have to be right.
Cook and I are almost finished here. Have a seat.
They ran the residue you scraped from both crispers' front doors. It's a combination of plumber's putty and rayophene gum. Burns almost completely away when you light it.
Who's this?
Nobody cares, Ronald.
-- Burn them.
Investigator Rimgale.
Inspector.
People.
But you could do it, baby. We could use the bread...
You brought it back to the Church. And then it made it's way back to me, again.
Me?
I got them all going for Oakland. With bullshit money. We'll cover the $800.
All right. What are you gonna do?
Good. I'll give him an extra 10 grand for his trouble. I hate that motherfucking house and --
Get this, man. I was at the game today. Face to fucking face with Strawberry! Jesus! I saw him strikeout. And you know what? He looked at me, and I looked at him, and he laughed and I laughed and it was like we were all alone in that whole stadium and only we understood that it was all a racket, that he struck out on purpose, and that he's saving it up for the Big One. Tomorrow. Today I understood for the very first time that --
Yes, Sister?
Delacroix.
The Mau-Mau's are up in dis place. That's right, the Mau-Mau's.
What's that?
What are you talkin' about?
Don't shoot me, I'm just the piano players.
My world famous, famous world Arroz con pollo will be ready very soon.
And I'm the feet.
Yo, you gotta show some patience. You want me to snap my fingers and presto chango - you're an overnight sensation.  Son, there is no such thing.
We got evicted from our home. We've both been on the streets for the last week.
If it's not too much trouble could you order us some food?
I want you to start using the name Mantan and not Manray if you don't mind.
Mantan?
Because race has always been a sensitive issue in this country. Gary, I have no problem with people disagreeing with the show, it's when folks start trying to mess with my inherent right as an artist, that's when I get mad.  No one, in any way, shape or form should be censored.
So are you telling me everyone knew about this get-together except you?
I'm an oreo, a sell out?  Because I don't aspire to do HOMEBOYS FROM OUT OF SPACE, SECRET DIARY OF DESMOND PFEIFFER, A PJ's or some as you might put it, some "nigger" show?  I'm a Tom?  I'm whiter than white and you're blacker than black? Is that what you think?
Exactly!
In the projects.  Like Eddie Murphy's "The PJ's."
That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout. That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout!  He's off the hiz-hook!
I want a hot, young white director. Maybe the kid, that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy Madonna video.
What are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky Madonna video?
I'm gonna leave you two creative geniuses alone.
I want to speak with you.
Purely for medicinal purposes.
I didn't mean that, in life.
Nobody told me anything.
What good are you if you don't tell me stuff like this?
How can this be?  You and me at the same time, the exact same thought. It's scary.
Manray was under our nose the whole time.
Do you know how you will use him?
The point being that him, the networks don't want Black people on television unless they are buffoons.
Why did you even come up with that shit if you didn't want it made?
It was the principle.  Dunwitty had to be enlightened.  I was making a point.  I take pride in my work. Plus, I already told you I wasn't gonna walk away from my money.
You've said that already.
We both lied to him.
A gift.
Yes, your name?
Hi, Mona.
Oh, is it?  Buddy boy, in this business if people don't produce, they get fired.
How's the food?
Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already.
Not at all?
I never had a really real pair before.
You're welcome.  You shouldn't give up on performing.
I don't know what a retort is, but it's simple.  Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show is UNIVERSAL.  It's not just for Negroes in Compton or 125th in Harlem.  This is America.  Our ancestors helped build this country, we got a right, just like everybody else.  I'm not gonna box myself in. This show makes people think, and they're laughing at the same time.
This is my best friend Sleep 'N Eat.
To come back to our roots.
Mantan, way too short, too tight. Get her one of dose...
...like macaroni and cheese...
Sleep 'N Eat, what's the matter with you?  Using all dose ten dollar words?
What do you want to know?
What else?
Gots no intention of ending up broke.
You're sure this is a good idea.
Just ask me what you want to know.
Did you ever sleep with DeLa?
I'm not afraid of highwaymen.  My man is armed, and so am I.
I have acted as I think fit.
It's a lie!  You're a deserter! You're an impostor, sir; Your lies and folly have confirmed this to me. You pretend to carry dispatches to a general who has been dead these ten months; you have an uncle who is an ambassador and whose name you don't know.  Will you join and take the bounty, sir, or will you be given up?
And this is the return you make for his kindness!  Didn't he harbor you in his house when your father died, and hasn't he given you and your mother, rent-free, your fine house of Jamesville yonder?
He'll give the better mark.  I am not afraid of him.
Oh, it's with pistols we fight.  You are no match for Best with the sword.
I deny your Grace's accusations, and beg you to say how you have been cheated?
Gentlemen, I wish you a good day. Will you please go to the house from whence we set out this morning, and tell my man there to send my baggage on to Three Kings at Dresden?
I risk nothing, for I am certain to kill him.
Very well; but a man who yields takes to his legs.
Have you had one?
Will we always leave it at this?
Shall I tell you something -- I believed what was called love came after the union -- and I was surprised when my husband, making me a woman, made me know it only by pain, unaccompanied by any pleasure. I saw that my imaginings had stood me in better stead.  And so we became only friends, seldom sleeping together and arousing no curiosity in each other, yet on good terms for a while, as whenever he wanted me, I was at his service, but since the offering was not seasoned with love, he found it tasteless, and seldom demanded it.
Lady Cosgrove, you are an old fool.
All the same, you must name an amount.
Was he cheated?
Then this must be done tomorrow.
Yes, he's fine.
Bill Styles...
Fuck, what the fuck is going on --
You framed-him...
We got -- I don't know, we got separated
Some.
You saw West's body.
You shot Childs and Nunez.
That first night with Pike. I made the mistake of letting him sit down at around 0300.
Back up.
How do you know that?
Cadet, what's your name!
Shut up.  Let me see your grenades.
Jesus, what happened?
Roberto, what the fuck?
We just want to check your pack --
Why?
His chest was hamburger --
Way I figure it, West must have found out about their little business and was gonna bust them, so they decided to get rid of him first...
You said you wanted to know what happened -- I'm telling you the truth.
Maybe I shouldn't tell you that. Maybe I should tell you I wasn't scared at all. But I was...  Enough to almost kill him.
MAYBE WHAT --
Would I have called you if it wasn't? If there was any other way --
The official term for it is "Clusterfuck". By the time Beth hit us, I'd canceled all off base exercises save one -- a six man cadet team and their Drill out in the bush. We're missing three and the Sergeant. The cadets are in their eighth week of the cycle, nobody here knows much about them, up to and including their names. But the Sergeant...
A few years ago, the Army picked our good buddy as their go to non-com to trot out to the press to talk about the kinder, gentler military. He even did the standard video greeting played to all incoming Basic cadets across the country.
What are you talking about?
If you let him testify then it would have all come out. West was supposed to take care of it out there, shut Nunez up and then disappear. But it got messy and people got killed. So you called your old pal Tom Hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you.
You're drunk --
For the last time, I have no idea what you're talking about --
Gotta be honest, I love what you've done with the place --
Wording and your friendship with the Colonel aside, I'm not comfortable having you involved in this.
Three things. First -- You don't have a choice. Second -- I've never taken a bribe in my life. And Third -- I'm still a little drunk from last night, so if I skip over the witty banter and move forward to straight hitting on you, try not to take offense. Tell me about the two guys.
Typical army brat story. Dad was noncom, Mom was a Nurse. There was never any real doubt of joining up.
You're kidding.
Something wrong?
Remember, he's the son of a Senator, so go easy. Kid gloves.
I didn't shoot West...
Exactly, someone who's not involved, who's word can't be questioned. You only let them see what you want them to see, you make them believe, so when the time comes, they've totally bought into your version of events.
Buttfucks the cabin?
Are you sure?
No, I didn't. I wanted to humiliate him. For what he did to Dunbar. For fucking over the little guy.
Yeah.
No.
We can tie you to the chair if it'll work better for you --
Go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
He said what?
It won't work --
Who, Levi --
Where's your shirt, Mueller?
Goddammit, Ray, we gotta get out of here --
The fuck are you talking about --
Search parties for the others are fanning out in a ten click radius from the pickup. If they're hurt and we can get to them in time...
You never told me why you got kicked out of...
Those who I deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit, and those who refuse to quit I will kill. You ever hear of a training accident -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
Thank you.
The town of Spectre. Best kept secret in Alabama. Says here you're from Ashton, right? Last person we had from Ashton was Norther Winslow.
Will.
You must be Edward Bloom.
Apparently I've overlooked this one piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that. You see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety.
Hardly two stories in the whole place. Now I've heard in real cities, they've got buildings so tall you can't even see the tops of 'em.
Really?
What did he say?
Your mother hasn't been keeping up the pool. If you wanted to you could...
Do I? I saw an iceberg once. They were hauling it down to Texas for drinking water, only they didn't count on an elephant being frozen inside. The woolly kind. A mammoth.
Dad!
What, you're seeing down to my nose? My chin?
You tell lies, Dad. You tell amusing lies. Stories are what you tell a five-year old at bedtime. They're not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty. And the thing is, I believed you. I believed your stories so much longer than I should have. And then when I realized that everything you said was impossible -- everything! -- I felt like such a fool to have trusted you. You were like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny combined. Just as charming and just as fake.
I can try, Dad. If you help. Just tell me how it starts.
Oh.
Hello.
Were you and my father having an affair?
Look, I don't know how much you want to know about any of this. You have one image of your father and it would be wrong for me to go and change it. Especially this late in the game.
No, it's logical if you think like your father. See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else.
I'm going to check on him.
But it's not true.
We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really.
How is he?
Yes.
What?
You have. You've actually fallen for this prick.
To customers approaching the bank from the rear
You can see why it's sensitive?
Good. 
And...
Hold on.
Of course not. Alexei, he's is my problem.
What was that?
Oh nothing.
I suppose it's... I mean define your terms.
Yes.
And how was the flight. Sorry, am I speaking too fast for you?
Do uh... Sorry. Can you follow me? Do you understand what I'm saying?
Uh... Are you a giraffe?
Syevodnya?
In every sense. If at all possible.
You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt already.
Where's the restroom?
What?
What? No you're not..
Shut up. Have you got your passport?
What?
It's none of your business.
He will come back.
Okay. Let's... Okay. Okay. You have had sex with people you don't like haven't you? For money. To make money.
And who says what is wrong.
So. What then? You just detach sex from everything..
Are you scared?
Except for Small Eyes.
I've got an hour. Can I buy you a coffee?
You have excellent English.
I'm sorry. It's these soft shoes I wear for my back.
My little niece... she got this deep cough.
You take her to a doctor?
At church?
Hey.
What do you need?
He black alright, he just ain't blue.
No, ma'am.
Yeah.
It's not her fault, Gill. She's had to take care of me all this time, cuz I'd just start throwin' up... choking. Just losin' my grip. And she listened. She listened to me.  And... I got better. I don't get nervous like I used to. And since we been together... she been faithful to me. Put all that junk behind her...
Nothing's gonna happen. Not like everybody over there is in the line of fire with them Arabs blowin' themselves up.
It gets worse there. Leavin' me to my own mind. That's just not good.
We leavin' this weekend. Deke got a friend in Mobile gonna get him a job at the water company...
Thought we was gonna be friendly about this.
Better'n me?
Rose... please...
Would'a chopped my arm off if you asked. And this how you do me!
Teh... Tehronne?
Well I don't...
Think it'd be best if you stayed put while we talk.
Naw'sir... I gotta be on my way.
What do you want?
Some crazy Jesus freak, gonna fuck the spirit into me...
Cuz once in a while soil need a change. Corn take up a lot of nitrate in the fertilizer. So next crop what ya do is plant ya some soy beans. That give off a lot of nitrate. Change keeps it all growin' and growin' strong.  Sting a bit?
Look it... I put the Goddamn dress on, didn't I? I think I'm handlin' myself with some... fuckin' restraint here... how you got me locked up like a dog on a...
Get'chu at that table up yonder.
I didn't mean it nothin' dirty.
What'chu sayin'?
Bojo called. Said you got to see your brother at the long end of a broken bottle.
A naked woman, chained in ya house?
Get me ten bags of mulch.
Why she got a chain on her?
But that's so fuckin' stupid.  I'm sorry. Didn't mean to curse.
What's this?
Why?
... I found the goombah... Cavello. He's --
Charlie, don't do anything.  Promise me?
Not a prayer.
Getting very weird.
I'd feel better if we had some heat.
Squid?
Connie...
Where're you going, Ichiro?
... We got to keep looking.  Track him down!  Great balls of fire!
It may be too soon to talk about it. When someone we care for dies we...  ... keep something of their's.  A tie, a pen.
Ichiro --
... A Godfather.  His man was killed at the printing plant.
What's in the box?
For Sugai.  Caviar, French cheese, ham... If you come to apologize for interrupting his meeting, Sugai may feel obligated to see you.
You did great, Ichiro.
Gaiijin?
I've heard of Sugai.  I've also heard of the emperor.  They're both national treasures.  One's a hood.
I need someone to translate for me.
Who am I supposed to be?
No one's keeping him here.
Yeah.
Hey, inspector, I don't intend to take the rap for this.
Could you fill me in?
You had my help, detective.
Good.
Where?
And what can he do for you?
What's the problem?
Death.
I want more life, fucker.
Because by the second day of incubation any cells that have undergone reversion mutation give rise to revertant colonies -- like rats leaving a sinking ship.  The ship sinks.
How about breakfast, I was just going to make some.
Why are you staring at us?
Show me something?
You could help us.
What about your friend, the man who owns this building?
Tyrell could help us, Sebastian.
I'd be happy to mention it to him.
You're our best and only friend.
Yeah.
Take a number.  Canapt 1700, tenth floor, Villa Vita District, Olympia South.
Yes?
Do you have something against science?
How old am I?
Hey, it's okay.  I like to pee. So how are you doing?
Love is just another name for sex. Love is sexy and sex is lovely -- I don't care what you call it, an android can't have it.
I'd like  you to take a look at these pictures.
I didn't know if I wanted to handle her -- I already got a snake act.  But my partner goes down there to the Opera House on suck night to book the good ones.
What shows?
I wouldn't accept it.  Also, I'd report the person who gave it to me to the police.
So?
How are you doing?
Do you dream?
Yeah.  Sometimes.
This feels stupid.
You're sick, Deckard.
Uh-huh.
Black?
What's your name?
They left.
I'm hungry, J.F.
Twenty.
My glands.  They grow old too fast.
As a matter of fact I did.  They've got some work to do tonight, but they're gonna come tomorrow.
I'm Adam Webber.
Come where?
My office.
How do you do?
I'm sorry, and legs. Legs, butt and hair.  Well, isn't he?  And shallow, as well?
Where are we going?
Well, I guess because I'm a little psychic...I have this thing.
So far?
Again.
See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but pretty much. That was pretty good, wasn't it?!
I'm sorry!  I said something wrong, didn't I!  Please forgive me!
So for four thousand dollars, all I have to do is drive you to your hotel?
Yes.
Heck, no!  What?!
Oh, I could die...
No.
Thank-Q!
How long would you need me?
It's your life.  And, by the way, it's a dandy.
Oh, I'm sure it will!
I don't want to be alone.
Two weeks.
Um-hum.
I'm seeing...snow... lots of snow. Way up North.  Are we getting hot?
Yeah, right!  That's where you'd go to find girls!  Nome.  He's gay, by the way.
No.  We keep it in the backyard.  Of course, in the house.  It's in there.
The what?
I certainly do!
I like her.
What about her?
Why?!  I think she's very attractive.
Because we're bitches!  Look at her! Look at the expression on her face! The walk, the jewelry, the fingernails.  Please!
That's ridiculous.
No.  I admire you.  I...I fell in love with you the first time I saw you.  I did. I think that you are the most--
I'm really sorry!
What in the hell are you doing here!! You're supposed to be over on San Vicente Boulevard having unsafe sex with that slut Sophie!!
Eve, if you'll let me, I can --
But it just wasn't where I wanted to be so I left as politely as I could and found a taxi.  But I asked the driver to drop me here instead of at the hotel.  There's a song Mister Como sings called "On the Street Where You Live."  You know it?
Not at all.  And Eve thank you for tonight...and for the kiss. My first.
We can make this work, Adam! Believe me! I'm very good at making things work!
Is that a birthday cake?!
Yes, it is.
Are you all right?
I've got almost everything we need! And this nice man...
You're right!  It's Tuesday already! By gosh, time flies, doesn't it?!
These are wonderful.
Your mom made that all by herself.
I promise. Is that all?
You have very nice ceilings.
And it's called...?
I've never met anyone like you in my life.
Well, we try. Listen, let me just ask you a few questions.  When did Alaska become a state?
Who use to own it?
Yeah?
I'm not wearing his pants.
That's why little things mean so much to him.
What?!
You bet!
A magazine?  A toy perhaps?  In the bookstore.
I know what you mean!  I usually wear a big hat and dark glasses.
My father is a genius.
Thirty-five.
You don't look thirty-five.
Come on. Frozen. How much are they?
Oh, my holy stars! A Negro!
I was thinking of selling all the cards.
Your father has a few final words for you. You know, he'd fight a buzz saw for you - he loves you so much. We both do.
He'll catch him.  Hi. This is Nina Aron.  I've got a run away and I'm going to need police assistance.
Unless we get a postcard or somethin', that's my guess.
The blast?  Honey, I have survived a host of things. Like the song says: "A country boy can survive!"
"Hell up here?"  Honey, it's been hell up here, down there and over yonder! Hell everywhere.
It's time.
I've read up on it. I'll deliver the baby myself if I have to.
Yes, dear!
To keep us from trying to leave. After an atomic blast there's a radiation half-life that lasts thirty five years.
No.
What?
Is there a problem?
If I...you know...
Get the presents and do the lights.
Oh, yes.  It just fascinates me how all    these things work.
I'm going to give it to you straight. There's no point in beating around the bush. There were survivors. Apparently, the fallout has created....a subspecies of mutants.
We stay down here.
No, Calvin.  We're not going to make do.  Not me!  Not Adam.  We're going up no matter what!  We deserve it. Even if it's terrible!
I thought ten years.
I forgot some of my stuff.
You came back for these?
Hey, they're Ralph Laurens.  And who's this interesting looking fellow?
And I suppose you see him in some sort of strapless  thing, don't you?
I see "elegant."
I think...it...works.
Well, I'm trying to educate him!  It's nothing personal.
And I don't fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards!!
What?
Oh, no!
Then what?
You didn't stop anywhere else?!
Tower, say again!!
I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have.
I think it's important not to get depressed. Depression is a terrible thing. They say it can bring on illness.
I've seen a few.
I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it.
Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. Hurry. I'm in the apartment. Hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.
The phone. What did you hear on the phone. Tell me. Word for word.
Nothing. Are you alright?
I made it go down the toilet.
Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.
Hi, can I come in?
Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.
No.
Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?
I want you to hurt me.
Okay. I know you've been scared. Now you want to scare someone.
Do you love me?
Where have you been?  Oh God, they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.
Alright, suit yourself.
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me, and you and really it's all thanks to Don, isn't it. Remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
No way, get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.
MOMMY!
Who's this fuck?
I don't want to go.
Go where?
Heineken.
Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.
What time are visiting hours?
I'm going out for awhile.
I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.
Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
Sandy?... Sandy, please.
No, you're right.
Hi Dad.
Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good.
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
What else is new? Right?
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? 
There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. And a musician. And some others.
That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long, the police are watching.
I guess I'll see you sometime.
I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
I'd like to talk to you about something.
You said it was a strange world. And you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy? She is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
I don't know, it sounds like a good daydream, but actually doing it is too weird. Too dangerous.
I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?
I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?
You really want to do this, don't you?
Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
Yeah, but.
I, I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.
I don't see how I can, and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. Also it could get you in trouble.
Who, me? Why should it?
Can I give you a kiss good night?
You better not, Jeffrey.
You want to go talk to him?
Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.
It's okay.
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
Let's wait for some slow one.
No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
Jeffrey? What's going on?
I don't know why we have to watch TV.
Stop it Mike.
Any tips on where these guys may be?
You think they sold me out? No way.
He knows you, man. He knows all you want is to move up. That's all. A smooth hitter woulda gone in there, seen it was a wash and slipped out. But a guy like you? Knowin' this is your only chance? Waitin' eighteen years?
Forget it. It's a family prayer. My father, his father before him that sort of shit.
What... the dirty bitch! I hope ya trounced her a good one!
We paid attention in school.
I'll see what I can do. How do I get in touch with you?
me up the...
"What do we tell him about the guns and money?"
Yeah, these guys always got a lot of rope strapped around em in the movies and they always end up using it.
I'm serious.
That was way easier than I thought.
With every breath we shall hunt them down.
And number three, Dolly.
They were wearing masks.
Where's my cat?
Your what?! Your fuckin' what?!
And the pennies?
Oh, she's quite proud of herself.
This is some heavy shit. This is like Lone Ranger-heavy man. Fuck it! There's so much shit that pisses me off. You guys should recruit 'cause I am sick and fuckin' tired of walkin' down the street waitin' for one of these assholes to get me, y'know?
You fuckin' guys. You ruined me. I'm fuckin' done. Permanent package boy.
Hey Murph.
You look like Mush Mouth from Fat Albert.
You're right.
I believe these young men are right.
Hey, Rocco, wait. Come back here.
Dignan, it's --
Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.
But Dignan, do you really know that much about rare coins?
Eight dollars.
Now. One thing we need to discuss is timing. Timing is absolutely crucial. What are you doing? Anthony!
Dignan, calm down.
Is that the manager?
Yes, they are.
I'll just say it.
It's not a plan. It's just --
Now that makes sense. We'll hang out for a couple of days. Get a little R&R. Make sure Future Man's OK and then get back on the road.
This morning.
You were asleep.
He told you and you let him do it.
He told me because he wanted to know if I wanted to go.
We're going over to this bar if you feel like going.
I can't believe he just jumped you.
Man. I'm sorry. We just went for a walk --
I don't think we need any keys, Dignan. I think I can hotwire a car for us.
She needed it.
You're in love with the fucking housekeeper!
What exactly is this place? Freezers?
As a person?
Yeah. As a girl.
You're all clear.
Who tripped the alarm?
Where's Kumar?
Come on.
I'll see you there.
Like amnesia.
Yeah.
Does it float?
What?
Tell me something. What the hell kind of name is Dignan?
I don't want to die.
Oh, yeah. They'll never catch the guy.
Anthony, I --
I'm not playing any more golf.
No, I don't mind.
Yeah, but he still has the aggravation. Three days sitting in a cell.
Was Future Man adopted?
Give him a second.
The front stairs.
That sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail.
Is that him?
That's your friend Anthony?
Mr. Henry pulled that job in 1965. It's famous. Applejack was the wheel man. Did you use this same car, Applejack?
Dignan and Anthony, this is Little Richard. He's crazy. Totally nuts.
He looks like he was designed by scientists. For desert warfare.
How much could you grow? Realistically.
I can't believe you said that.
No, I was saying crazy like a lunatic.
You know, Bob, Anthony did kill someone. He electrocuted our janitor senior year.
He electrocuted someone?
Did we get it?
I told you they were there.
In all probability nothing would of happened. But why take the chance? That's why I ran. I mean how many plants were even back there? Five? Ten?
My brother's in jail.
The cops say it's a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana.
Dignan, he's my brother. I can't just leave him there.
I know it's not.
It's too bad about what happened on the road.
Bob, you're lying!
That's OK.
I couldn't hear anything.
He's having a heart attack or something.
Do you have your own cell?
I know, Bob. You were on a secret mission.
I'm trying.
He said what?
Crowd control. Crowd control. Wake up, guys.
You like Chicanos?
Guess I'll get another Tecate.
Si. Tecate. You like to fight?
What?
You Hoto?
There was a mistake.
Neski was a roadblock. Without me, there's no company, no fortune. You owe me, Uri. One last push.
Treadstone.
You don't know what you're getting into here.
They found Danny Zorn's body. Dead in the basement at the building where my people got hit the first time.
What do you have, Danny?
Is it a slam dunk? No, but...
Keep going...
It changes things. That knowledge. Doesn't it?
Then what?
-- my coat -- but we should --
-- where? -
Say it.
It was Pamela Landy's op. The guy was going to sell-out a mole or something. I haven't been debriefed on exactly what it was.
You didn't answer my question.
We'll know for sure when we get the security tapes.
This is everything? Is there.
Good luck.
Let's give him half an hour.
Do we know what this says?
Here's what I've got.  Remember Vladimir Neski? Russian politician? Seven years ago, he was due to speak to a group of European Oil ministers here at the hotel. He never did. He was murdered.
We just had a funeral, isn't that what it means in England as well?
We cannot defeat this --
What is it?!
No, M'lord.
Nor I! I want to live! I want a home and children and peace. I've asked god for those things. But He's brought me this sword. And if He wills that I must lay it down to have what He wants for my country, then I'll do that too.
Three, maybe more!
We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.
Test of manhood.
You win.
Is your Poppa a ghost -- or do you converse with God Almighty?
Excellent! Stephen is my name. I'm the most wanted man on the Emerald Isle. Except I'm not on the Emerald Isle of course, more's the pity.
We don't split up!
In my heart I had begun to hope that he would never break.
Where is my son?
Shall I leave, M'lord?
Confess, and you may receive a quick death. Deny, and you must be purified by pain. Do you confess? ...DO YOU CONFESS?!
Nor I!
When the king returns he will bury them in those new clothes. Scotland is in chaos. Your husband is secretly sending an army north.
This Scottish rebel... Wallace? He fights to avenge a woman?
Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities? The executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?
York was the staging point for every invasion of my country. And that royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots, even women and children, from the city walls.
Peace is made is such ways.
You have... you have a husband.
Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps even live in the Tower. In time, who knows what can happen, if you can only live.
I thought I was dead when ya pulled that dagger!
Not according to his teacher. It just got me thinking about Jason and what if Evan's inherited his father's condition?
Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he's got severe coping problems about not having a father. Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad.
It's worth a shot. I can arrange a controlled meeting. A careful dose of sedatives for Jason, some security, you and I monitoring. Evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck, no more missing father complex.
No.
Honey. What were you doing with that?
I don't know... I don't remember.
I can't help it. I'm just so proud of you. You've got the highest grades in all of your classes.
Sure...
...I spoke to your new lawyer about the appeal. He's sure he can get you off on self-defense, so if you're patient.
What does that mean for Evan?
How. Did you. Know that?
Where are you now?
Go on. Nothing can hurt you. Remember, this is only a movie. You're completely safe.
Hey, Evan. What's the big rush? We don't meet for another hour.
But I... I need those books.
You really think he wanted to kill you?
Are you stupid or what?
I deserve a lot worse.
Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts?
Of course.
It was a long time ago.
Just shut up, Evan. You're wasting your breath.
Ha! Where's that?
You're right, Evan, I don't believe you.
Shit. I dunno. How would I know about the twin moles on your inner thigh?
Know what?
Remember, everyone! Only two weeks until your science projects are due.
Come on, go on...
Can... can... Can I have this?
I couldn't cut the rope.
Destroy it?
It wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think I was a piece of shit.
What did I say about mentioning that bitch?
Yes?
My husband is with me, too.
No, of course not. Do you mind if I do?
Go back to Bulgaria.
Oh, but if you knew what it means to us to leave Europe, to get to America! Oh, but if Jan should find out! He is such a boy. In many ways I am so much older than he is.
What is your name?
I want you to take Miss Lund home.
Er, good luck, yes.
Fine, but I would like to buy your cafe.
So could I. And I'm a poor businessman.
I have a proposition for whoever has those letters. I will handle the entire transaction, get rid of the letters, take all the risk, for a small percentage.
Don't forget, you owe Rick's a hundred cartons of American cigarettes.
As leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca, I am an influential and respected man. It would not be worth my life to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo. You, however, are a different matter.
It was gracious of you to share it with me. Good day, Mademoiselle, Monsieur.
And Mademoiselle?
Occupied France?
Say goodnight to Sam for me.
In America they'd bring only a penny. I guess that's about all they're worth.
No, no, no, no. We must leave.
No. No, Rick. Not tonight.
You can believe that if you want to.
I don't have to. I've got them right here.
No.
Huh. But it's still a story without an ending. What about now?
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life.
It's been a long time.
Some of the old songs, Sam.
Oh, he never... well...  he's got a girl up at the Blue Parrot. He goes up there all the time.
I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa.
Goodnight.
What happened with Rick?
Our faithful friend is still there.
Whatever I'd say, you'd carry on. Victor, why don't you tell me about Rick? What did you find out?
Did he give any reason?
Ilsa, I --
I know how it is to be lonely.  Is there anything you wish to tell me?
How do you do?
Your work.
Monsieur Blaine, I wonder if I could talk to you?
My friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record. You ran guns to Ethiopia. You fought against the fascists in Spain.
I said, ask your wife.
I'm going to anyway, because it may make a difference to you later on. You said you knew about Ilsa and me.
Yes.
I understand.
We'll be there.
Then we shall state another time and another place. Tomorrow at ten in the Prefect's office, with Mademoiselle.
Very well, Herr Laszlo, we will not mince words. You are an escaped prisoner of the Reich. So far you have been fortunate enough in eluding us. You have reached Casablanca. It is my duty to see that you stay in Casablanca.
Unoccupied France welcomes you to Casablanca.
By the way, the murder of the couriers, what has been done?
May I recommend Veuve Cliquot '26, a good French wine.
You give him credit for too much cleverness. My impression was that he's just another blundering American.
Captain Renault, are you entirely certain which side you're on?
I have no conviction, if that's what you mean. I blow with the wind, and the prevailing wind happens to be from Vichy.
A leader, like Laszlo?
And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?
Rick, there's going to be some excitement here tonight. We are going to make an arrest in your cafe.
Well, he's succeeded in impressing half the world.
Is that a serious offer?
He is traveling with a lady.
Louis, whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape?
The winning side would have paid you much better.
Yeah, you were saying?
Well, it looks like you're a little late.
What friend?
Ilsa is Laszlo's wife. She probably knows things that Strasser would like to know. Louis, I'll make a deal with you. Instead of this petty charge you have against him, you can get something really big, something that would chuck him in a concentration camp for years. That would be quite a feather in your cap, wouldn't it?
I was informed just as Laszlo was about to leave the hotel, so I knew I'd be on time.
Sam's piano.
I suppose you know this isn't going to be pleasant for either of us, especially for you. I'll have to arrest you of course.
Well, Rick, you're not only a sentimentalist, but you've become a patriot.
What is your nationality?
Aha. Who do you think will win the war?
You will forgive my curiosity, Mr. Blaine. The point is, an enemy of the Reich has come to Casablanca and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us.
Thank you.  Will you have a drink with me please?
I don't mind a parasite. I object to a cut-rate one.
One moment. Tonight I'll be selling those for more money than even I have ever dreamed of, and then, addio Casablanca! You know, Rick, I have many friends in Casablanca, but somehow, just because you despise me you're the only one I trust. Will you keep these for me? Please.
Feels so good to lie here.
Come on, shape up, get going, you can do it.
Use the sail for a sea anchor and you won't move.
That's death knocking, knocking on your door.  Crazy little woman come knocking, knocking at my front door...
You can't make it.
You know what happened to this?
As much as anybody.
Our apologies that it never made it to the recipient.
I've got lots of time.
Got to follow the paper path here.
What do you want me to say?  That I thought I'd done a great job but it all turned to shit?  That I might as well have gone sailing for all the good I did?
You can't go now.
Get back?  From where?
I thought you might have.
The plane went down.  My friends died.  I washed up on an island.  Then I found these barrels, built the raft, and here I am.
You hated being alone.  Couldn't stand it.  Busy every minute.  Always plugged into something.
This is so unfair.
You too.
Sorry...sorry... Why do my joints still ache?
Dehydration.  Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency.  Any or all of the above.
Your body chemistry and your exposure to the elements would normally lead to irritability, depression, anxiety, periods of self-reproach.  It's almost like schizophrenia.  Different sides of your personality might come to life, speak out, act out.
Really?
Maybe I should take a few days off. Roger's working now, you could use some help around here...
It is Ibrim, I, I am a sorter.
I checked the weather, you had the jet stream, you could have made it up.
I'm touched.
Look, I'm sorry about your plane.  But I couldn't risk being late into Memphis.
Cool ropes.
I need to do it.
Thanks.  For everything.
Permission to come aboard, sir.
Permission granted.
May I ask, where are you bound?
Only if you can afford it.
It's that Mrs. Goodhall you have to be careful of, Wilbur.
This is *your* life story, Wilbur! You just changed the dates!
Dr. Homer Wells.
I was lookin' for Wally's letter. I was gonna show it to Homer...  They made him a captain already-- *Captain* Worthington!
How many months are you?
Oh...
Uh... have you been *feeling* okay?
What's the *medical* explanation?
Sometimes... movies mostly bore Wally.
Aren't you worried that people will cut their feet?
*What* will be okay?
Fine. That's all there is to it then.
I told her! She doesn't feel she can do that. Something about her father not letting her go anywhere...
Please don't move, don't go anywhere.
"...did." Well, okay.
No, I'm the one who should be sorry. You have every right to be angry.
Hi...
I've got some more clothes for you-- I just keep forgetting to bring them with me.
"Homer Wells, born Portland, Maine, March 2, 1915..."
Is *your* father dead?
Did you know your mother better?
Uh, sure--that's what Kong thinks, all right.
I don't remember.
Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me.
Where are you going?
No, I'm not. I need a job.
"Burma run" because you fly over Burma...
What about the trees?
Are we supposed to be up here? The rules said...
Slow down, Homer--don't be in such a big hurry.
Ain't nobody havin' *sex* with my little girl, Homer--that's somethin' a father knows.
One cervical stabilizer, two sets of dilators--Douglas points. One medium- sized curette, one small; one medium speculum, one large; two vulsellum forceps.
There's more than one laceration, more than one cut.
It looks like scurvy.
Where's the name sheet?
Nobody's named this one yet.
He doesn't like it.  He's a boy, That's why.
In other parts of the world, I suppose there are other ways.
I am not a doctor.
Rose Rose?
You okay, Rose?
I bet the view looks better from the Worthin'tons'.
I fail to see how a little Christianity could *hurt* anyone here!
You all take care of yourself, too, Homer!
They ain't drops--I picked 'em off the tree!
That sounds like you is in trouble already, Homer.
We should drown that damn Jack in the vat!
But I'm not that late. You didn't have to give away my seat.
Brutal day. They say the streets are lined with money down here, but I guess you have to know the secret handshake. What are you drinking?
Big.Com. That Internet thing.
Keeping the Fix happy.
You never know when you can use a crooked cop.
But there were other factors.
He's just as crooked as the next guy. You'd think he'd have more important things to do with tax payer dollars.
Is that what it was, Jake? Was it love?
Currently, the King Pin is a very large-type pole stuck up our asses.
That's it? What are you talking about? We can still do this!
And what about Big Al?
When?
How's that? He works for Gillette.
Yeah... Whatever, Jake.
She got one leg out from under him. Now we had to lean.
Eight A.M. flight.
So that's it...
You ever use the bathroom in Kennedy?
I can't do that.
All the shit we pulled with you and you're trying to shake us down? You guys got sack.
Special Agent Gunther Moonan. Ring a bell?
Mr. King, I think --
Uh... Everything okay?
How do you know I will?
How do you deal with --
What do you get, Lily? Finder's Fee? Because it is all about the money, right?
Do we want insurance?  I'm just asking...
What do we need another Shill for?
What?
It never worked before because A, they didn't flush the bank enough; B, their corporate papers were for shit; C, they didn't have someone on the inside with Customs.
Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run?
What you're looking for in a mark is someone who's weakness you can exploit.
What do we do? We change the scam?
Your buddy. That fat guy. The King couldn't wait to have that guy whacked. He didn't even know who the guy was, but he was so pissed off at him, he gets him drilled. It ain't personal. It's business.
Eee Oott Auught!
And like in a game of chess, you've played every possible move in your head...
The King? Jake, you play the heavy rackets like that... They put the lug on for nothing at all.
I can handle it.
So what do you want?
What?
Peace of mind.
I'm Bella.
Can you? I'm happy being a dealer. At least the punters keep their hands to themselves.
What are you laughing at? Who was that on the phone?
How about we split the diff... Seven-fifty.
Is that your idea of arithmetic?
She went back to South Africa.
I'll try and make it.
Last hand.
I get it.
Good night?
I couldn't resist them.
You really are a beautiful woman.
I want to hear it.
I've got a job.
What's the time?
I loved it blond.
Probably.
This fucking job's getting to you. You haven't written a fucking word since you started.
Marion, stop this.
I don't like it at all. You had a wonderful character before, the Gambler. He was so romantic.
I'll leave the casino soon.  I promise.
Then what?
Don't let yourself down.
Oh hello.
And the lies. Gamblers are born liars.
Do you believe in astrology?
What happened?
That trick tonight, I don't think I've ever seen that before.
It can only work with amateurs, A pro would have spotted it.
I didn't.
They mean it.
Just listen. You don't have to do anything criminal.
But if it does.
I can't do it, Jani.
Did they tell you to sleep with me?
Yes.
That bruise has cleared up nicely.
Detective Inspector Ross.
You did?
You've been avoiding me.
So how do you feel, your first night? I'll bet you're on a high.
No thanks, Matt. I need my eight hours.
That Greek guy who won at the end. You paid him out in 25s not 20s.
And the girls?
No thanks.
I have to assume the serial numbers on the bowl and cylinder correspond.
Very impressive.
That hair will have to go.
I'm getting this flickering light on one of my panels.
I hope it's not the oven again.
What the hell?
Remember what we found? Fourteen light years for a fucking mindless vegetable that looked like a limp balloon and went squawk and let a fart when you touched it. Remember?
Fail safe in lock. Four minutes to drop, 22 minutes to detonation. This is Sergeant Pinback calling Bomb #20. Do you read me, bomb?
You are false data.
Hello, bomb.
False data can act only as a distraction. Therefore. I shall refuse to perceive you.
Hey, bomb...
This is Lieutenant Doolittle calling Bomb #20. I repeat previous order, you are to disarm yourself and return immediately to the bomb bay. Do you understand?
...you may be doing so on the basis of false data.
Which one?
Any planets?
The new star. What are you gonna name it?
Fred.
-- remove thrust drive repellant --
-- Remark.
I need a diameter approximation.
You know what I think about, Talby?
Lieutenant Doolittle, I'm getting a definite malfunction on one of the closed-circuit computer systems...
Ah, Lieutenant Doolittle? Sir?
Yeah?
I'm glad you've come to talk with me, Doolittle. It's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me.
Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up, disbanded over thirteen years ago.
It didn't work?
Sorry, Doolittle. I've forgotten so much since I've been in here. So much.
What were you saying, Commander, about the bomb?
Men... men... what happened, men?
Bruno's girlfriend.
But see tonight wives and girlfriends aren't invited.
What?
You mean until you showed up?
'Cause you went out the back door and nailed her girlfriend?  Who would take offense to that?
Thought so.  Turned out he wanted me for something else though.
I ain't mad at you...
He's a mistake I made about six months before you did.  But don't feel bad. Justine made the same mistake, along with Renee, Jada, Tia, Brooke--
What a creep.
Just thought maybe he'd like a little coffee with his saliva.
Damn... Are you alright?
So this guy walks into a bar and says...
So, what, you just like the sound of your own voice?
Look around at all this...  Built by people who got up every morning and worked hard trying to make a better life.  Then the bomb happened and everyone got scared.  They blinked and before they knew it they'd given away the store to a bunch of thugs who were happy to take it off their hands.  Overnight the government, the police, everything intended to protect the people had been turned against them.
Is the social studies class over for today?
Ever notice how cats always seem to turn up around dinner time?
Like following me around and pestering the people I work with wasn't bad enough, but breaking into my apartment--
So saw my hands off, I left you a present.
Am I s'posed to be grateful?
You lost me.
How well do you remember the lab?
A girl.
So, you know the lengths he'll go to keep her from going public... I'm turning Lauren over to Canadian law enforcement tomorrow.  They'll put her in witness protection, but if you're with her the risk of her safety goes way down.
She's put her life on the line, and her faith in me.
Well, not me personally.
What's this?
Know where I can find her?
I need to talk to her.
Who are you?
My name's Lydia.  And it seems you and I have a lot in common.
Who's this guy?  This isn't who we're looking for...her name was Hannah.
What about the other kids?  You get anything on them?
I don't know what your story is and I don't want to.
Your fiance has four previous wives.  His M.O. is to clean 'em out and take off.  Which is what you oughta do.
I need a favor... I need you to trace a number for me.
What guys do.  'Nother order.
So are dogs.
They don't have a lot of moving parts.
I say hang the bastard out to dry, let her see him for the heel he is, then maybe she'll step to the all-girl team and let mama-licious ease her pain.
Not right now.
Quite a mouth on a girl so young...  ...but my guess is talking is not what it does best.
Don't believe everything you hear on TV.
Hey, Sketchy--
I know what you're thinking.  But the truth is, this other person is not someone I'm in love with.  As a matter of fact, after what she just did, she's not even someone I like much.  So in a technical sense, I'm not sure you could call me and her cheating...officially.
Do guys actually believe their lame, self- serving excuses?
Or do you think we're just so grateful to have one of you idiots we'll look the other way, which is arrogant and condescending.
Lame, self-serving, arrogant...guilty as charged.
And Lydia telling Natalie the truth makes you a victim in what way?
Fight fire with fire.  Threaten to go to her husband.
She tells you how I've been--
But you explain that you're a compassionate and understanding person who can find it in your heart to forgive me.
Or, I dissolve into an angry, hysterical wreck who never wants to see your lying ass again, which is probably what would really happen.
She came by the apartment once already. Fortunately, I'd disconnected the doorbell as a precaution... Lydia's not gonna back off until she gets her pound of flesh.
Easy Sketchy.
You would be making a mistake to come away from this thinking she's the villain in the piece... You are.
He's sick.
For a change.
He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.
You're a little scrawny, but thanks to the concert we're low on amateurs. Name?
Pick a song, Hawk.
I didn't mean for that to be so... intense. Forgive me.
Peter Criss is my inspiration, man. If I paid a hundred bucks for a KISS show and all I saw was his solo, I'd consider it... money... Hey, how'd you know that?
Oh, God, how calculating of me to lead you all on like that after you offered me a ride in the middle of nowhere.
What was that D.J.'s name again?
Second floor girls' john! Two minutes! He'll never look there!
Too bad we're stuck in electronics or...
But... but, St. Bernard's is way the hell over in the next county!
Hawk, all I need is one ding on the Volvo and presto! There are my balls hanging from the rearview mirror after she gets back from Cincinnati.
And when is she due back from that groinecologist's convention anyway?
Are you gettin' wise with me?
How would you like a nice Hawaiian Punch?
Jam, listen up.
They're still at my house in Trip's jacket.
Guys, GUYS! Come on, if this is anyone's fault, it's mine. I was the one who grabbed Trip's jacket by mistake. It's my fault and I apologize.
Go ahead, Jam.
Mom, what're we...?
Well? Continue! Continue!
Trip, a female gynecologist does not a lesbian make. And even if it did, at least my mom didn't give birth to me while she was on LSD.
Trip, you fuckin' asshole.
I knew it! I knew this was gonna happen! I had a bad feeling since last night. Remember? We are so totally fucked!
I did it! I did it! We won!
But we took the keys?
Please sir, don't beat me up. I do have a KISS ticket, but not on me.
What do you want?
Yeah.
Good morning, mongrels!
Each vessel travels along a vector path through space-time... along its centre of gravity.
Uhh... sure. And in order for the vessel to travel through time it must find the portal, in this case the wormhole, or some unforeseen portal that lies undiscovered.
Why do I have to sleep with Donnie? He stinks.
Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to worry about.
Where did you come from?
My dad said he found you on the golf course. Are you sleepwalking again?
Where are we going?
You know... we've been going together for a week and a half...
They suspended me for two days.
Oh, yeah.  "The Philosophy of Time Travel". What is this?
I know she's here. She never leaves the house.
Hey.
Did you call the cops?
So how was school today?
So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?
And when the other rabbits hear of Fiver's vision, do they believe him?  It could be the death of an entire way of life, the end of an era.
I think he saved my life.
Don't you watch the news?
Yes.
What is her name?
It reminded me of my dog Callie.
And they grow out of our stomachs?
Nothing.
Yes. I went to jail.
What did you want for Christmas that year?
That I did it again.
You've done it again?
Whoa, Elizabeth. A little hostile, there. Maybe you should be the one in therapy. Then Mom and Dad can pay someone two hundred dollars an hour to listen to all of your thoughts... so we won't have to.
No I don't.  She worries about you.
Her name is Gretchen.
How much are they paying you to be here?
Did you just call me a fuck-ass?
That's enough.
No. I took a year off to be with you.  Of course I care. Don't get angry.  What?
Rose, we have a crisis.  I am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations against Jim Cunningham.
Yes. And believe me, of all the other mothers I would never dream of asking you, given the predicament with your son. But none of the other mothers are able to go.
Wicked.
No more fuckin' for her.
We got eggs, water balloons, and a dozen rolls of toilet paper.
I -- I'm quittin' the pageant.
All right, say "Airport Ho-Jo."
Your parents'd kill you.
Oh, Mom, it's so ugly.
Okay. Yesterday I... I got this picture. So I kinda, y'know, I'm thinkin' no. I'm gonna, I -- I -- I'm gonna quit the pageant.
We was robbed.
But, doesn't someone taking your costume so you can't compete, overrule that rule?
What're you doin' here?
Yeah...
Loretta, shut it.
Shut it up, Loretta.
Let's just say who should win, who deserves to win is Amber.
Well, excuse me, Annette, but I'm braggin' up your kid, here.  Amber's gonna be the next Diane Sawyer, y'know...
They're makin' a movie, here, goddamn it.
We're also the co-founders of the Minnesota Modeling Academy. Applications are at the tiki bar. We'll wave the fifty dollar application fee if you list a friend and put her address.
That's right.
Ohio...
What?
Yah -- she's damn near as good as that little black fella -- with the glass eye.
Sammy Davis, Jr., honey.
So help me, Gladys.
Iris, stop!  It's not his fault. The communal wine just proves too temptin' for some of them.
Oh! What is it?
You get nothing, Hank, okay?
Yes, sir. 
You haven't been still a moment since you've been here.  You act as if you had neurosis --
He used to be a bloodhound but he's anemic --
I don't call him, I whistle.
I've got just the place for a man like you but I'm too busy right now to do any digging.  What do you call your dog when you want him?
Well, if you don't want your dog why don't you put him in a pound?
Oh no, I can't do it.
Sure.  How much does the job pay?  Sure, if there's a chance for advancement.
'At's-a no good.  I went to Niagara Falls once.
Hello...  Yes...  No, not yet... All right...  Goodbye.  That was for you again.  He wants you to call him up as soon as you get back.
Let's see -- What've I got in my cabinet besides mice --  I've got it -- how would you like to be Secretary of the Interior?
That's no good.  I like to work on the outside.  I must have something easy.
Then we've gotta start one. Do you know how to start a war?
You've got a brain after all - and how you get along without it is amazing to me -- Now, who can I insult?...  Who do we owe money to?...  AMBASSADOR TRENTINO!  How about him?
He's-a very easy to insult --  I say something to his niece once, and he slapped my face.
He's going to make a good spy... that's not bad for the first day.
You're right about that guy -- I think we've got something.
Well, we gotta one hundred thousand men.
That's the spirit -- fifty-fifty.
We gotta two battalions and one Frenchman.
Chicolini, you've come just in time. We need a man who's fearless, brave. A man who's willing to die, if necessary.
If any man should come between A husband and his bride, We find out which one she prefers By letting her decide.  If she prefers the other man, The husband steps outside; We stand him up against the wall And Pop goes the Weasel!
$50?
That's what you think.
Once more! 
Bah!! 
The future of Freedonia rests upon you.  Promise me you will follow in my husband's footsteps.
Well, a gal a day is enough for me. I couldn't handle any more.
Oh, Your Excellency, I don't know what to say.
Gloria -- may I call you Gloria?
I -- I may be wrong, but I suspect the Secretary of War.
Well no -- not exactly -- but --
Gentlemen!  Gentlemen!
I shall report this indignity the my President.  Mrs. Teasdale,  I feel this regrettable occurrence will plunge our countries into war.
This is all Firefly's fault -- that idiot, that fool...
Mr. Merrick, sugar?
And here is one of Frederick's mother.
Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?
John loves the house.
Yes.
Oh, Freddie. What could that wretched vampire say to upset you?
That I am very little different from him.
He's doing it to spite me, I tell you, and it's got to stop!
He was fine when he left here, and now look at him.
What happened?
Why is he sitting up like this? He needs rest.
Just a moment, how did you get in here?
You misunderstood. This man suffered a severe fall, if you take my meaning. He's my patient now and I must do what...
So you can beat him? So you can starve him? A dog in the street would fare better with you!
You've acquired a taste for this?
Then will you meet him, as a representative of the committee.
It was a nice try, Treves, but the man is so obviously mouthing your words.
Don't you think this is a bit premature? We don't have the backing yet to...
I feel much better. Thank you.
Three quarters of an hour.
Certainly, if you insist. You must have quite a find there.
Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is "like me".
An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.
Oh no?
Well it is a miracle he ever got back. And, I'm sure, Mr. Treves, under your expert care, he'll have many happy years ahead.
Well, it's all quite... I've never heard... It's quite...
y-y-yes--
Yes!
Righteousness for his namesake.
...Yes potatoes... but...
Why did you let me go on like that, teaching you what you already knew? Why didn't you tell me you could read?
Good evening. Very well, thank you. And you?
The hospital?
It's very good. I'm enjoying my visit with you very much. It's so very kind of you to have me as a guest in your home. I'm sorry I made a spectacle of myself.
...my... home?
Yes, John.
Mr. Treves! Treves.
Oh yes! It was wonderful!
Good. Excellent. Now then, Mrs. Mothershead, I want you to come into this room with me. Inside there is a man with a rather... unfortunate appearance.
He's had his share of "smacks", Mothershead. I expect that's what drives him under the bed. We must use patience and understanding with this man.
Mr. Treves, some more books arrived for Mr. Merrick.
Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter put them in my office.
YOU BASTARD! You tortured him. YOU TORTURED HIM, you bastard. WHERE is HE?
Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.
Open up! I know you're in there!
Well... where is he?
WHAT did you say?
Five this week; how many the week before?
Erik. You don't understand.
No. Don't look... The abyss will suck away your strength.
YOU still want to go to Asgaard?
I... but I...
I shouldn't have come.
But have you ever seen it? Think back...
No... we don't...
I'm sure it's lovely.
No. 
About raping me?
To pay for the next expedition, of course.
But that's a circular argument! If the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition, they cancel each other out.
Well you started it.
I just said I didn't feel like raping you.
Thanks for saving me from a fate worse than death.
Halfdan the Black's here!
You talking piffle, son?
Who have you been talking to?
So?
That's better.
You need to say a bit more than that!
Wait, Erik!
So Halfdan the Black's using magic, is he? Well, I have a magic to match his! 
What's all the panic about?
How did he do that?
Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife became a Buddhist, not a Christian.
I'm not worth risking your life for.
Who's that?
You just can't make enough swords and spears and knives and daggers to satisfy the demand. You could charge Halfdan twenty and he'd pay it.
Oh, I couldn't do that! The Blacksmith's Code says...
Wasn't it, Keitel?
And his "you'll never be a Berserk if you lose your temper"...
You'll see my grandfather in Valhalla!
And something to sharpen them with?
I remember.
Yeah, you told me that later.
It's so cool. You're by far the most sensational person in the room.
I'm so excited. Yay!
I didn't have a chance to wrap it.
Just, you know, to chat a little, maybe. I have a long trip ahead of me.  How far are you going? On the train, I mean, of course.
I noticed your hair. I guess it made an impression on me, that's why I was pretty sure I recognized you.
Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names. Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution. That'd be a job, coming up with those names. How do you get a job like that? That's what I'll do. Fuck the dole.
My writing career! Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski.  The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.
Sorry. I was just trying to be nice.
I'm Joel.
Okay.
Where do you live?
Sort of, um...
Take care.
You pick it.
Well, I go to a psychic and she's always telling me I'm psychic. She should know. Do you believe in that stuff?
No, not at all.
Oh, yeah.
Yo ho ho!
No. I want to have a baby. I have to have a baby.
I don't want to talk about this here.
I just don't have anything very interesting about my life.
What?
Joel!
I'm done, Clem. I'm just going to ride it out. Hiding is clearly not working.
Egad, were you horrified?
It's very late.
I didn't think you'd show your face around me again. I figured you were humiliated. You did run away, after all.
But my sleeping is really fucked up.
Okay.
That's okay. I --
Hey, Joel --
Says you were a slob, leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake.
I guess so.
Guess what I'm wearing.
Hi, Naomi, it's Joel.
How's the chicken?
We'll start with your most recent memories and go backwards -- There is an emotional core to each of our memories -- As we eradicate this core, it starts its degradation process -- By the time you wake up in the morning, all memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared. Like a dream upon waking.
Well... I did.
We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about --
What? What do you mean?
No. I just need some space, maybe.
It's been a pretty lonely couple of years.
So I'm going to get some sleep. I'm glad you're okay.
Stan... c'mon...
It's just... y'know... I mean...
Don't you think Howard's like that? Smart? Important?
What?
You better go.
And after that?
Hi.
The office is filled with people who want their memories re-erased.
Remember the Alamo! Remember the Alamo!
Mary...
Is that Nietzsche?
What, Howard?
Howard, they've disappeared again.
I'll go out for a smoke. If no one minds.
Hi, I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd see --
Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties.
Oh? Well, there's been some trouble on the ranch. I came up here to get out of the way. It's so dark now I doubt if I could find my way back down. If you could help...
What was that?
Clockworks.
Siwash, huh?
I'm staying with the Countess.
You don't?
About being a cowgirl. What's it all about? When you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl.
No, I guess not.
Oh, we didn't get it all the way on.
Getting dressed. I've got to go.
To my own special Sissy. Cheers! And welcome. So my letter brought ya flying, eh? Where were you? Salt Lake City? La Conner? Well, I may have a little surprise for you. But first, tell me about yourself. It's been six months, hasn't it? In some circles that's half a year. How are you?
I've always been proud of the way nature singled me out. It's the people who have been deformed by society I feel sorry for. I've been steady moving for eleven years and some months. Maybe I should rest up for a spell, I'm not as young as I used to be.
Shit O goodness, you won't be thirty for another year, and you're more beautiful than ever.
Sissy, Sissy, blushing bride, you can desist from wearing paths in those forgotten highways. The Countess has arranged a job for you. And what a job...
If you don't want me to pose for him, why do you want me to meet him?
From what?
The containment, Second Containment...
Captain Miller, we're ready to repressurize the Clark.
You prep the gravity couches. I'm going to manually arm those explosives.
It's holding... She's holding...!
He's a rescue technician. Peters, medical technician. DJ...
How is he?
Hear what?
"Save yourself. From Hell."  What are you saying, are you saying that this ship is possessed?
I've got a pulse, he's alive...
Thank you.
You don't just dismiss Bill Weir. The man held Oppenheimer's chair at Princeton. If the Event Horizon had worked, he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since Einstein.
I've reached another containment door. This thing's huge...
...you okay?
That's the engineering containment. And there's the main airlock. We can dock there.
That is not acceptable --
No one?
"Insane?" The finest astronauts fought to be posted to this ship. It would take the Lewis and Clark a thousand years to reach our closest star. The Event Horizon could be there in a day...
You have something, Dr. Weir?
That's bullshit and you know it! You built this fucking ship and all I've heard from you is bullshit!
Yes...
I don't know...
"...to rescue the crew and salvage the ship." The crew is dead, Dr. Weir. This ship killed them. And now it's killing us.
You... You can't do that!
I told you... She won't let you leave...
Your eyes...
Captain Miller, you copy?
...you break all the laws of physics, you think there won't be a price? You already killed the first crew...
Skipper...
Radiation interference?
We're all here.
Carbon dioxide?
No. It was someone else.
If you knew it was impossible, then why'd you waste my time?
What's going on in there, Starck?
Blow it up?
Weir.
Keep him talking.
Hey...
Jesus, that is one big ugly fat fucker...
30 hours to Neptune orbit.
This is U.S. Aerospace Command vessel Lewis and Clark, hailing Event Horizon, Event Horizon, do you read...? This is the Lewis and Clark, hailing... 
Miller, do you read me, Peters --
Could it be the crew? If they were in suspended animation, wouldn't that effect the scan?
Maybe a power interruption crashed the system...
What is it?
Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
Those yours too?
We're going to have to work on your touch.
I wouldn't know anything about that.
I mean...
It's easy for you to be patient.
Where is Reed?
Ben?
Maybe you should think about yourself for once. You always let this guy push you round --
We got what we wanted. That's enough.
No. I cannot take orders from that underwear model. That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
Three days. I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
It's about to be a broken face.
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
What's wrong with me?
The machine works. And Vic's gone Mister Hyde on us --
You're on fire!
What are you trying to say? Just because I dress well and like to dance --
But all these people...
Sweet.
I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --
Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here. And keep it quiet. I don't need this to hit the press.
I, uh, think I remember the number.
I think it was a little more complicated than --
Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --
I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter's main power to generate enough voltage --
When I walked out, I waited ten minutes outside your door. Ten. Waiting for you to come find me.
It's just business.
I told you, I'm fine. It's you I'm worried about.
Please don't make this personal --
What's there to do at the Point? God, Lisa, we've been going together almost two years, and...
Go ahead. Just make it quick.
Totally.
Come on, Hamilton. You're going over there to represent Captain Kidd Fish and Chips. We have stores all over Southern California. Part of our image, part of our appeal is in our uniforms. You know that!
No. I want my money back right now.
Brad! Have Mom or Dad seen this?
Brad, what would you say if I asked you to just put these flowers in the trunk of the Cruising Vessel and get rid of them at work?
Is everything okay at work?
I've been doing some thinking. It's my last school year. I'm a single, successful guy. I think I want my freedom.
I didn't say that.
You're not going to tell me, are you?
Did you threaten this customer or use profanity in any way?
Yes, sir.
I can't wait until I can drive next year. I walk every day. It's such a drag.
Hey, Mike?
Look, I'm kind of in a hurry.
Don't talk to her. Let her know. Use your face. Use your body. Use everything. This is what I do. I just sent out the vibe and I have personally found that... girls do respond. Something happens.
Of course something happens. You put the vibe out to thirty million chicks, you know something's gonna happen.
Okay. Tell me. What's the Five Point Plan?
I think I've got it. Once I get going, I'll be okay. But... how do I get started? I mean, I hardly know her.
Hey, Mark. Is that you?
Well, I've gotta be running.
If you ask me, she's pretty aggressive. You understand what I'm saying?
Sensitive is when you can tell how people feel without asking.
Yeah, well, I saw the movie. That must mean I'm sensitive too.
Not if you're over sixteen.
How've you been?
I was going to say... your eyes look a little red.
All right.
It's a bunch of Jocks in a Granada!
We just missed the turnoff to the party.
My brother is gonna shit.
No there are variables that, like, I might not be good at.
You'll always remember your first time.
I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes.
What's Doug do in Chicago?
That little prick.
There goes your stereo for another year. Mike Damone is a no-brain little prick. I'm not letting him get away with this.
Sometime?
You mean, you couldn't? Or you wouldn't?
I don't know. I guess so.
Now, Mr. Spicoli, comes a rare moment for me. Now I have the unique pleasure of squaring our account. Tonight, you and I are going to talk in great detail about the Davis Agreement, all the associated treaties, and the American Revolution in particular. Now if you can just turn to Chapter 47 of Lord of Truth And Liberty.
Hey, Mr. Hand, can I ask you a question?
Don't worry, Spicoli. You'll probably squeak by.
That's a nice shirt.
I think I better take you home.
We keep them.
You keep them.
Do you have Mrs. George for English?
Do you know what you want?
I think I'll have the Seafood Salad Special.
Do you mind if I excuse myself for a moment?
Aren't your parents asleep?
Do you really have to go?
Hi, Mark.
Anything to drink?
You did the right thing. Never try to understand a press message. About half the time we use codes -- especially with Dr. Gonzo.
There's no hurry! The race is over!
Jesus! Did I say that?
Where's the medicine?
Pay no attention to this swine. He can't handle the medicine. 
That's the press table. Where you have to sign in for our credentials. Shit, let's get it over with. You handle that, and I'll check on the room.
Why?
Holy shit! They almost had us there! That was quick thinking.
Good God! Let's get out of here! Where's the elevator?
Have you made a deal with him? Did you put him on to her?
Not me. It would blast you through the wall -- stone dead in ten seconds and they'd make me explain it!
BULLSHIT! Don't make me use this.
There's no choice. I wouldn't dare go to sleep with you wandering around with a head full of acid and wanting to slice me up with that goddamn knife!
What? Fuck telegrams. I'm in trouble. You worthless bastard. I'll cripple your ass for this! All that shit in the car is yours! You understand that? When I finish testifying out here you'll be disbarred!
Shit. I met her on the plane and I had all that acid.  You know, those little blue barrels. I gave her a cap before I realized... she's a religious freak... Jesus, she's never even had a drink.
NO! Stop talking like that.
I saw these bastards in Easy Rider, but I didn't believe they were real. Not like this. Not hundreds of them!
Me?
Some of what?
So do we, lady.
I think we should put her on the payroll. See what she comes up with.
There was nothing in the atmosphere of the North Star to put me on my guard...
The dope ring. You must know what's going on in this hotel. Why do you think we're here?
Maybe she's telling the truth. Maybe she's not part of it.
Yeah. I know. I'm guilty. I understand that. I knew it was a crime but I did it anyway. Shit, why argue? I'm a fucking criminal.
How far is Baker? I was hoping to stop there for lunch.
I don't know what you're talking about!
Oh Lord! I'd do just about anything for that!
I will not die because of him!
We'll meet in three hours?
Well, it don't look pretty.
Stop it.
And the rest of 'em?
No, no, no it was... it was wild out there, no time to think, we just moved. He didn't leave me. He just ran.  He just ran.
It's in the basement, about a hundred yards long. It spits out on the backside of that hill down the way. There's a truck there.
What!? I'm not going down there again!
I'm gonna shoot him if they don't get him first.
Well then I guess we should just give up.
What now, Geronimo?
We gotta try.
We gotta be close.
Wait, before you do that, help me to the kitchen, I need to lay down. There's a cot back there.
But --
He's dead.
He only shot you once.
Will these boards hold?
Is it gassed up?
Fully.
Holds four.
Seven.
Got 'cha!
You are taking a chance that is not worth the risk.
Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?
Hurry!
There's a rifle and a shotgun here.
If there is only one way out for us, there is only one way in for them.
She's still alive, I hope. I wouldn't have made it this far if it weren't for the chance of seeing my little girl again. I need to get to her.
Did we make it?
I'm not lying.
And on top of her political activities, now she's got a lawyer. She wants out of her contract, Mr. Bebe. She says she's through with motion pictures.
I'm sure it wasn't me, it wasn't me...
I guess so, sir.
No, I'm concerned with everything.
You know what I mean.
I hear you're meeting with the studio lawyers to get out of your contract.
What?! Good Lord no, it's just... It's money. We needed backing and... well, we found it.
A rich actress.
No. It's all about that night, isn't it?
Oh, God! Let's get her out of here tonight, right now! Let's take her with us!
The hearing's tomorrow. If she gets out legally, they can't come after her.
Harry!
No. Cut this runaround, Doctor. I know better.
Be patient, that's all. Take an interest in your treatment and don't dwell on your resentments. You'll be yourself again, I assure you.
But I'll never win that.
Of course.
I love you, Mama.  I love you, Dad.
Are you... are you hungry?
Age?
Are you really serious? About acting?
Will you be getting back together? When you quit Hollywood, I mean.
Yeah. Well if you didn't put it in the papers -- nobody'd even know about it.
Harry York. I work for Martoni Kaminski, he's running for Congress here.
Yeah, well --
Honest. When you were up there, you were really... there, know what I mean? Everyone else looked stupid.
What?
You know, my old man was an inventor. Spent his whole life down in the basement trying to design transcontinental underground railroads, stuff like that. Well, I was supposed to be his partner. When I told him the smell of his workshop made me sick, I thought he was going to die right there.
Sure. Try this acting thing. You can make good money at it.
Yeah, I read about that. Terrible business, suicide.
They killed him. They threw him out that window.
Oh no...
Well, the studio told me not to.
You know, the funny thing is: it's not a great movie. I mean it could've been, but they screwed it up, gave it a happy ending. And all my friends, I know they're going to smile and say they loved it.
It's midnight, Harry. My glittering raiments are dissolving.
Think I'll have a glass.
For not chopping off his head and serving it to me on a platter.
I'll bet.
That sure looks like fun...  You know how long it's been since I was behind the wheel?
That's right.
Hey, you're a good quarter-horse, kid, but you can't go a route of ground.
Huh?
What's that?
Yeah. It's just... something I gotta do, I guess.
Yes you do. If you love me you can wait, right? A month, six months, whatever it takes.
How did I look?
It's going to be slow from now on. Do you know what I mean, Harry?
No.
Yeah, I know what that's like... Where you been?
What'd you do?
That's fine with me...  Get it? Fine. A fine! Hey c'mon, c'mon, what is this, an audience or a jury?
Miss Farmer! In light of your flagrant disregard for the conditions of your probation, coupled with the unwarranted assault on the Plaintiff here... I am forced to order you to begin serving a sentence of 180 days in the County Jail.
You're Farmer? Oh... Well, look, they took your stuff out. Moved it to some hotel, I think.
Yes, you win them, you bring them into your heart, touch them, but you don't set them on fire!
The speech? Real good.
Don't listen to him, little sister. When you're proud of what you are, you don't refuse the label, understand?
Yes, but important people are concerned about this. Judge Hillier spoke to Alma Styles --
Why are these all opened?
At one. Promise?
I'm not cured. I was never sick! They had no business putting me in there! My only responsibility is to myself now!
Of course, she hasn't anything definite in mind.
No! All you've done is try to break my spirit, try to turn me into you! But I'm not you, mother, and I never will be, and thank god for it!  That goes for you too! And frankly, I don't know how, with the two of you, I turned out as sane as I am --  Wait right there, gentlemen, I'll be with you in a minute... and believe me, I don't want to stay here one second longer than I have to!  But I've got to tell you, Lillian, that one day before you die, you will realize what you've done and hang your head in shame. In shame!
Yes...?
Don't I know you?
It ain't for lack of trying.
Just a little joke, Miss Farmer.
This whole thing is a joke!
Doctor, I hate to break this to you, but my mother is a little batty.
What?
I longed to be with him. But I wanted his final moments to have peace. I could see you were a friend to him.
And he drove me to mine.
Yes. I have been seeking my friends.
You speak.
Friend?
Like you? Oh, God, you don't know what you're asking.
Something's wrong. I know it.  I've heard rumors of cholera spreading south from Hamburg.
Are you all right?
You will.  What do you want, Victor?
Your decision. For us.
I remember the first time I ever saw you. Crossing the floor of the grand ballroom with my parents at your side. So beautiful even then.
A warming wind.
Do you foresee this happening in our lifetimes?
I was just clearing my throat.
Are you having me on?
Rich old ladies and their daughters?
You can't. Death is God's will!
No. He had more important work.
Yes? And?
Thank God your fever broke.  Slowly, now. Just a sip.  I've been worried we might lose you. It's been touch-and-go for a week.
Everything in moderation, Clerval.
No. They don't.
Are you sure you'll be all right?
Victor, explain yourself.
I tell you what we need, my friends. Forget the symptoms and diseases. What we need is a vaccine for death itself.
You're awake. I've prepared some broth. It'll help restore you.
There's a startling question, coming from you.  I'm captain of this ship. We sailed from Archangel a month ago, seeking a passage to the North Pole.
Then explain it, whatever it is. It could save the voyage. I've spent years planning this. My entire fortune.
I think we should go wake them up. Just in case.
You draw very well.
You want to leave?
Alice? The others show up?
Why don't we run? Just run now?
You saved my life.
You ever fire one of those bows again, and I'll tack you up on the wall to dry.
How about our last jay?
Whassamatta?
Girls can't be cowboys.
I got to.
They'll be okay if they know enough to stay in outta the rain.
Have you ever been there before?
So let's do it.
Unless you two wiseacres wanna be introduced to the joys of hitchhiking, what say we drop this?
I'm exhausted.
They're gonna kill us. They get us across the border, they're gonna take us out in the desert and shoot us.
You don't believe in suicide.
What's your name?
What's the story with you two? You a couple of fags?
He's my son.
Died instantly?
I've seen one of these before. A friend of mine had himself declared a minister of his own religion. Away to fuck the IRS. Is that what you're doing, or are you the real McCoy?
I thought so. You help us get across the border without incident, stay with us the rest of the night without trying anything funny, and in the morning we'll let you and your family go. That way everybody gets what they want. You and your kids get out of this alive and we get into Mexico. Everybody's happy.
Jesus Christ, Pops, don't start with this shit.
No, I didn't.
I'm telling you, don't hurt her.
Okay, does anybody here know what's going on?
I'm like you. I don't believe in vampires, but I believe in what I saw.
What's this stuff?
Kate, we don't have all day, so I'm only gonna count to five. One...two... three... four...
Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The world's my oyster, except for the fact that I just rammed a wooden stake in my brother's heart because he turned into a vampire, even though I don't believe in vampires. Aside from that unfortunate business, everything's hunky-dory.
I'm really sorry.
Daddy's dead.
How many bullets left, kid?
-- you got your shower --
For the time being we are very confident we will apprehend the fugitives in the next forty-eight hours. The Bureau, local law enforcement and the Texas Rangers have all joined forces in forming a dragnet to snare Seth and Richard Gecko.
This can't be confirmed at this time, but we do believe it to be true. We have reason to believe it was the youngest brother Richard, and he was shot in the vicinity of his neck and shoulders by the store's clerk.
Hot goddamn day!
Were you giving that pig signals?
You can't come in here.
What dya mean?
What the fuck is wrong with you --
No.
Did you even to try to negotiate?
Shit, I started to get worried. Where the fuck ya been?
Is it me? Is it my fault?
This is not me! I am a professional fucking thief. I steal money. You try to stop me, god help you. But I don't kill people I don't have to, and I don't rape women. What you doin' ain't how it's done. Do you understand?
Yes, you did. You said as long as I don't act like a fuckin' nut, implying that I've been acting like a fuckin' nut.
You okay?
Yeah, we were just standing there. You said something about your shoulder hurting, then you just hit the ground like a sack of potatoes.
What?
Far out.  Where are my glasses?
They broke when you fell.
How 'bout you?  You are safer in here with us than wandering around a Mexican border town all night long. Just don't do nothin' stupid and we'll all get along fine.  Scotty, you sure you don't want a drink?
Yeah, it's mine.
B.O.Q., south side.  Take a starboard tack out the door.
That's what I hear.
But are there... I mean, how many...
Senator, they stand out on the public highway with telephoto lenses --
-- and now I got reporters from Toadsquat, Iowa, calling my office and askin' what I know about this "G.I. Jane" thing.
Standing right here in my office.
Yes, of course.  Please, have a seat, lieutenant...
What I resent, lieutenant, is some politician using my base as a test tube for her grand social experiment.  What I resent is the sensitivity training that is now mandatory for my men... the day-care center I have to build where an officer's lounge used to be... and the OB/GYN I have to keep on staff just so someone can keep track of your personal pap smears.  But most of all, lieutenant, I resent your perfume, however subtle it may be, competing with the aroma of my fine three-dollar-and-fifty- nine cent cigar, which I will happily put out this very instant if the phallic nature of it happens to offend your goddamn fragile sensibilities.  DOES IT?
Same rules for everyone, sir.
Sir.  If tomorrow... I was not under your command... would the inquiry still go forward?
Shit.  Think we're had.
It should.  You nominated him for Spec-Recon just three days after you nominated me.
So it really has nothing to do with actual brain size?
Well, Flea, I appreciate the respect you just showed me.  But I don't need it and don't want it -- not that kind of respect, anyway.  It's just gonna hurt us both, okay?
Close as I can get, el-tee!
She's an officer.  There's a higher standard.
I'll try anyway, sir.
The Navy Cross...
I was looking for him earlier, but...
Thank you, sir.  We hear back from the Pentagon?
This has nothing to do with you.
Get your dick back here.  It has everything to do with you.
You're such a ball-breaker sometimes.  Especially at night.
It's done with, Royce.  Let it go.
I'm tired of fighting back.  I just wanted to come home and be safe and have you here and the river there and just forget the rest of the world, okay?
Look.  It's not like you'd be completely out of reach.  And maybe we could call in a few favors, get you stationed at Norfolk instead of Coronado.  There are ways of dealing with these things -- I mean, if people are so inclined.
Green Eggs and Ham.  You're not going to get anywhere.  You might as well put me in the cage.
Would you have shot if it was a man?
No.  Yes.  I mean, depends on --
I think you're the liar.
Do you?
Well, I'm trying to figure out if you're stupid, unlucky, gluttonous -- or some new alloy of all three.
Sure.  Now she wants to shoot.
Shut up. How can you eat like that?
Audrey's going to stay with us tonight.
In the bedroom. Crying her eyes out because of you.
What are you doing?
Think we can fit up in there?
What are you talking about? The east side is always faster.
No, I'm into earthworms now. You wouldn't be interested. They're real "boring" creatures. Very reliable, dependable, no surprises...
Yes. The first of its kind. I found this blood sample earlier this evening...
What do I get?
Mr. Caiman, I've been doing extra research for you after hours and weekends for nearly a year. And I've never asked for anything but this job is really important to me. I'm too old to be an assistant anymore. I need to know this job is going someplace.
Not for a long time, now.
I'm sorry about all this.
Make sure they find that nest before it's too late.
They didn't make it.
Only five, Sir. We've checked them all. He hasn't used any of them.
CHARGEURES, property and casualty insurance. We are preparing a report.
Major, what do you think could have done this?
But there's no animal in the world that can make prints like that? Is there?
Don't tell me why it's not, tell me what the hell it is.
You know, he's not an enemy trying to evade you. He's just an animal.
What are you suggesting?
You gave them the tape?
Are you sure? How do you know?
How did you get all of this stuff into the country?
Contact the military and get them to send a bomber to blow up this building before these things escape.
Who the hell are you?
Dr. Lazarus, here is your surface mapper.  I have programed it to the coordinates of a Beryllium Sphere of sufficient density.
Uh uh! What did we talk about?
Come on, old friend...
NO!  WE'RE ALMOST THROUGH!
There it is. The Beryllium sphere.
"Purple skinned monstrosity...?"
I was staying in character.  "Egomaniacal sonofabitch?"
What the hell is going on?!!?
This is ludicrous.  Why are you listening to this man?  Must I remind you that he is wearing a costume, not a uniform?...  He's no more equipped to lead us than THIS fellow.  No offense.
He's a miserable twit!
Why didn't you stop at the market?
I don't know... It just wasn't like him.
Oh my god, It's real.
Look at that... Will you LOOK at that... They look like little children...
He dissed us AGAIN, Brandon!
Oh.  Okay.
... Yes?
What's  your name, son?
... But I want you to know that I am not a complete braincase, okay? I understand completely that It's just a TV show. There is no ship, there is no Beryllium Sphere, no diagital conveyor... I mean, obviously it's all just a-
Okay...  Okay, now what.
Commander, do you have a camera?  I'd die to see this in person... All they showed on T,V was a machine here, and a wall here... I don't know why they didn't show the whole thing.
No,  I am of the firm belief that in reality it is not a matter killer, but a matter REARRANGER, converting all molecules to the exact state they existed thirteen seconds previous to activation thus effecting a thirteen second time jump to the past.
What's the weather like outside?
U.... What do you think?
I am SO SICK of being right.
How the hell is Fred supposed to project a hologram?
They're still behind us...
More to the left... Stay parallel...
How much of a nothing? Not enough to split five ways kind of a nothing?
It's not the STUFF. I mean, anybody can learn the STUFF...  The important thing is COMMITMNT. 99% of anything is just committing to it.
How does the rolling help, actually?
Thank God. Are you okay?
Gwen...
That thing's not going to get us down there fast enough.  Face it, he's dead.
I heard it too.
My name is Jason Nesmith. I'm an actor. We're all actors.
Our dimwitted friends don't understand the concept of acting. They have no theater, no imagination these scientists.
Commander?... Where are you... going?
But Commander... The negotiation... You... You... You fired on him.
He has a very powerful ship. Perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of-
Then how did he find out about the device?
WHAT? WH
What's your frank estimation of the British?
And a French alliance?
Damn-it!  You've given us a whole new season, Benedict!  And Congress thinks that the British are going to ride right over us come spring. Now half their army is back in Canada.
Go on... I want to hear everything.
Is that a fact.
I hope I never have to believe that.
We're so damned important!  Look at us -- Nathanael, you were a horse- shoer, Benedict, before this?
While they're strung out?
There was this anonymous pamphlet circulated at Congress which says I am personally responsible for all our hardships.  And... that I have encouraged the people of America to make me into a God!  Benedict, it says that I have gone mad!
Me?  You apologizing to me?
Wil, I want to remind you of a conversation we started just before Monmouth...
Well, what have you thought?
General Lee, welcome back.  I'm happy you've decided to join us.
I'll expect you for dinner this evening, Captain Hamilton.  For Christ's sake, have a bath.
George, remember that night when we were drinking with Arnold?
Who the hell knows?  Everyone's giving orders.  It's all very democratic.
Of course the army will acquit him, that's not the point... Arnold is a man and will understand.  What I need to understand is, John, Sam... what is happening here?  Who are those people in there?  The fat ones in silk?
Finally!?  It's people like these who, as soon as they get a little power, want more and more.  More ale, here!
Any word from Canada?
A grand scheme?
How many generals do we have like Arnold?  He's got guts -- he's vain, and he fights!
Well, I shall deny him to you!  He is evil on earth!
Sir, please accept my commission from Congress... and...  You must see this portrait of my beautiful wife, Adrienne, we had the most perfect little baby girl just before I left.  Her name is Henriette...
No, please; an advance on your salary.
These supplies...?
It's another demonstration against the king.  This is the wildest yet.
My God, these people mean to go to war!  They really mean it.
What's the point of a revolution if it doesn't?
I'm with Captain Hamilton.
No.  We're all of us after something.  It's easy for me to fight for the common man.  My father could only dream that I would be... a general someday?  And what of my daughter or son?  I know what I'm after.  But now, with all this talk about compromise?  It means the rich will just be more wealthy and the common man has no hope.
At one time I could have chosen not to be.
But not more than your comfort.
Who says so?
And I mean high up in it.  That's why Harry's gonna make Mr. Lovejoy with me, not Chili Palmer.
Mr. Lovejoy? That's cute, Bo.
You guess? You mean you don't know?
I was thinking tonight you could go have a look around Palmer's hotel room while I go check out Karen Flores' place. See if he hasn't stashed it somewhere.
You get life for kidnapping.
What, did you see it work in some movie you got beat up in?
I'm just explaining to you what I'm doing here. Case you think I come to rob the place, rip off any of this dusty old shit the man has.
You must bring something heavy to the deal.
No shit, come on. How you gonna do that?
I put a gun right here...  ...and I tell him, 'Sign the paper Marty or your fuckin' dead.' Like that.
Young? She's fuckin' nine-years-old, same age as Lovejoy's kid. Bernie. One she calls Bernard. Have you read the script?
Yeah, I read it. I was just thinking you could make her older. We might even be able to get Karen Flores.
Who?
There's nothin' to know. You have an idea, you write down what you wanna say. Then you get somebody to add in the commas and shit where they belong, if you aren't positive yourself. Maybe fix up the spelling where you have some tricky words... although I've seen scripts where I know words weren't spelled right and there was hardly any commas in it at all. So I don't think it's too important. Anyway, you come to the last page you write in 'Fade out' and that's the end, you're done.
I can't believe the way you guys do business out here. I can't believe how fucked up your organization is.
Okay. Then be good enough to hand us our money back, or you think about us coming in on this new one.
Depends. Who's this?
So, what, this Zimm guy asking for some kinda finders fee, that what we're talking about here?
Look at me, Ray.
I told them I was you. I acted stupid and they believed me.
Anyway, you want this guy, he's in L.A. We put him on a flight after he spanked one a my cocktail girls in the Keno room.
Leo spanked a waitress?
Karen, say hello to Chili Palmer. Chili, this is Karen Flores.
I imagine in your line of work, there were times you had to get rough, you know, say one of your customers stopped paying.
You pack a gun?
For a movie?
Murray Saffrin, guy who wrote it, did all my Grotesque pictures, had it in a drawer for twenty years. He shows it to me one day, tells me he's got a star interested, would I produce it.
The problem is Murray. He and a few other blocked screenwriters went river rafting down the Kern a few weeks ago. Murray never made it back.
He drown?
Doris, Murray's widow, finds out about this Martin Weir thing and says since Murray and I never had any written contract, she wants five hundred grand for the script.
So you're thinking what if I was to put you next to my dry cleaner. Ask him if he wants to invest his money in a movie.
You don't even know these guys.
Is he giving you a check or cash?
You have it?
Maybe I oughta talk to this Ray Bones character myself. See if he wants to invest in my movie.
You cut straight hair in this place, or just fags?
You owe me the dry cleaner's fifteen grand plus the juice which is what another, uhh...
You mean like we don't give a shit.
No, I don't. Though I have to say I'm curious.
One we're producing.
Guy owes me fifteen large and takes off, I go after him. The fuck you think I do?
Like this?
Yeah, but you haven't found him yet.  The guy took off for Las Vegas.
Yeah, I like it, I'm high up, I can see everything, you know? It's the Cadillac of minivans.
Who told you that?
You broke in?
The interest is four hundred and fifty dollars a week on fifteen thousand?
I spent all day crawling out of a grave. The costumer kept bitching 'cause I was ripping my nylons â€-
Ripped nylons work. Makes the shot more real.
Yeah. It's a real gift.  I'm just saying it'd be nice, one time in my career to get the chance to say one great line. You know, like in that Bette Davis picture, "Cabin in the..."
He must mean after "Slime Creature 3".
Harry told me Martin loves it, he flipped.
I got you a copy of the script.
I was never much into it. All that bullshit having to do with respect. It's bad enough having to treat those guys like they're your heroes, having to smile when they make some stupid remark they think's real funny.
This thing's actually accurate. I bought it for ten bucks from a kid in a lawn chair on Sunset...
Harry... My God...
Why not?
Were you scared up there?
You bet.
Yeah, the guy owes Momo a few G's.
I'm going into the movie business.
You don't? What happened to Muff?
Anyone skim the pool? It needs it.
Yeah, that's what we need. More agents.
Lufkin. His... agent.
But you are interested?
I have to consider, I mean, as the mob guy, this is another man's wife I'm sleeping with.
What is the vessel name, registry, and present position? Over.
Passenger vessel "Chimera." I will spell: charlie hotel india mary echo romeo alpha. No registry information is available at this time. I have determined to the best of my ability that the vessel has been abandoned on the high seas at position one seven four west, five seven north at...  Two zero one four hours zulu time. Over.
North Island, have you got any additional information? Over.
Take it easy, Dodge. It's only a piece of metal.
Yeah, but not as cold as those Swedish girls you only gonna dream about.
Roger?
This's gonna hurt a little.
Light in those passages ain't so good.
Try Wednesday.
You gotta be kidding? What the hell we need that tub for, we got fifty million bucks?
Yeah, yeah. I'm on it.
I'm buyin' me a nice outrigger. Spend my time hauling rich Seattle business men through the Puget.
Bodies're too fresh.
Damn barbaric is what it is.
I might be able to find something on the ship. But it's gonna take time.
There's no way we're gonna hide a few thousand pounds of gold from the Coastguard here. Besides, it'll be safer where it is.
I don't know what you're talking about?
I don't figure there's much I want money can't buy.
We'll stand the watch on deck tonight. You're up first.
Show your tatoos to that coxswain last night, did you Epps?
You mean, before she sank.
Then why didn't they take it.
Coffee.
Candy?
Coffee?
Nope.
Maybe they didn't want it back. Maybe the whole fat deal was insured.
The guy. He just came this way.
Same. Any luck?
The ah... the radio's out.
"The crew have gone mad with greed and fight among themselves like wild dogs over fresh kill."
The same day she supposedly went down.
Hey.
Victims of what?
Murphy to Epps.
Nope.
What happened?
We're in an island chain. It's only a matter of time before we hit another one.
It was only a matter of time before somebody killed somebody.  You saw it coming as well as I did. Dodge had his plans, starting with scuttling the boat. And Greer too, except he went nuts. Couldn't take it, I guess. Could've happened in the middle of downtown Anchorage. But did it make him any less dangerous? I don't think so.
It's a trap. There was no way we were gonna get away with that gold. Nobody ever does. It's just the bait. This ship sucks people in and it never lets them out.
Greer to Murphy.
Red sky at night, sailor's delight.
Too deep to anchor out there.
You mean tow her back? That's a thirty thousand ton ship you're talking about.
You're up late.
We could call for help.
Let's just take it easy here, alright? Nobody's gonna kill anybody.
Pretty low all around.
Greek citizen. Merchant navy.  Obviously we aren't the first to come across this ship. They probably stumbled across it just like we did.
Never been more thirsty in my life.
You've been out for about a day.
We heard you scream. Any idea what you might've seen?
Nobody's going anywhere with that gold now. Anybody tries to board, we'll know about it.  You can do what you want, Greer. But neither of us is gonna risk saving your ass down here if it comes to that.
You got a leak in the number nine compartment.
That cost me twenty grand at least.
Fifteen, at the most.
Did I tell you who I ran into at the bagel place?
I made spaghetti. Do you want some?
Here we are... it's mocha mint from Lickety Splits. Oh, isn't that photograph just heart-rending?
Oh, I just love this song! Isn't it great? Doesn't it make you want to dance? C'mon!
Hey, it's nearly nine already - we're gonna have to leave now if we're going to make that movie.
Seymour! Hello! What are you doing here?
I-I honestly never intended for this to happen...
Who is this, Enid?
Well, I got the idea when I was doing some research and I discovered that Cook's Chicken used to be called Coon's Chicken, and so I decided to do my project based on this discovery as kind of a comment on racism... and the way racism is whitewashed over in our culture...
And how do you think this addresses the subject of racism?
And how does an image like this help us to see that?
I dunno... Would I have to take classes and stuff?
What do you mean?
Didn't Principal Jaffee call you?
But... can I still get that scholarship to the Art Academy?
What are you doing? You don't ever criticize the feature!
What can you tell me, young man, about the various flavors of "frozen yogurt"?
No.
Hi.
"Yeah, right"... well why not?  What's so wrong with me?
Nothing.
That's just the way I am!
Yeah, well --
I don't think we should... Look, you have to totally promise me you won't tell Becky about this.
God, what a bunch of retards...
Did you sign up yet?
Maybe there's some weird secret satanic society that meets at the Quality Cafe and all of the other regular customers are in on it except for us.
You can have that one.
You call.
God, I think Josh is too mature for us.
I think it's cute - look at his little weasel teeth.
He was so excited when you bought that record -- you're a saint!... God, these apartments are super expensive...
That's who people want to rent to. It's a known fact that it's way easier to get a job and everything if you're rich... All we have to do is buy a few semi-expensive outfits and act like it's no big deal... it'll be fun.
How about this one?
Let's get out of here, this place makes me sick.
I totally, totally hate you.
Anthony's II!
I don't know... Some people are okay, but mostly I feel like poisoning everybody.
Like what?
Face it, you hate every single boy on the face of the earth!
That's not true, I just hate all these obnoxious, extroverted, pseudo- bohemian losers!  Sometimes I think I act so weird because I'm crazy from sexual frustration.
This is it? I can't believe you're selling some of this stuff.
God, you're really obsessed...
Why do you care about this kind of stuff?
That guy's band is playing tonight... Alien Autopsy.
I don't believe you.
There's something wrong with every single place we look at! Why don't you just come right out and tell me you don't want to move in with me?!
You're the psycho! You haven't been able to deal with anything since high school ended!
I dunno...
You're lucky then, you can't see the veins on that guy's biceps.
Do you want anything?
Oh yeah, like he even noticed.
A mongoose... they eat snakes... you never heard of a mongoose?  That's a classic piece of vintage taxidermy. Nobody alive today knows how to do work like that.
Didn't they tell you?
If you really want to "fuck up the system" - you should go to business school -- that's what I'm gonna do: get a job at some big corporation and fuck things up from the inside!
Norman.
Really? Can I see it?
No you're not! You're a cool guy, Seymour.
I - I'd really rather not...
So, why did you bring this along?
Wait a minute! Hang on! Jesus, I gotta think of something to talk to her about. No! No...
Yeah, right, I'm a klansman - thanks a lot!... Do you know the Cook's Chicken franchise?
For nineteen years...
What are you, a fry cook or something?
Oh... uh, thanks a lot Enid... I really appreciate it...
I wonder if you really like all these old records or if you only like the fact that nobody else likes them?
Wow!  What was that all about?
It's just somebody's idea of a joke...
So, what happened?
Yeah, so I better go -- it's not really the best time to talk...
Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going with what's-her-name? Dana?
I'm going to this stupid art show and I want you to be my date... There's something I have to show you...
What's her problem anyway?  Did she actually tell you you couldn't see me?
No, no... not exactly... she just doesn't understand how I would know somebody like you...
I... I don't think so.
...What do you mean?
Uh... I think there's some root beer...
How come in all that time I was trying to get you a date, you never asked me out?
Sounds like a healthy way to deal with your problems.
I dunno, I...
Yeah, I'm really, really happy. Really having a good time.
Yeah, well... thanks for cheering me up.
I am.
I guess I see the teacup as a symbol for womanhood, because of tea parties in the olden days, but instead of tea I was trying to kind of confront people with this... like...
Maybe she's with Josh?
Why? What did she tell you?
I have no idea - I just want to...
Seymour?
There is no reason for fear.
-oh, sing a different song, Abdullah-  -there's nothing wrong with your men so stop telling me there is-
Don't they, though?
-what's the surprise in that, this is Africa?
I know it's your first day and of course you must be tired from the journey-  -but what are you going to do about it?
I'm David Hawthorne, this is my hospital. And my advice to you is, "don't get sick in front of it."  That was meant to be charming, sorry. I seem to have lost the knack.
You never had it.
-well, it's just...  ...other men don't abandon their wives at such a time-
You said "of course" you'd need the donkey. Why "of course"?
I've never been all that adventurous. I wouldn't be in the way?
-far end of camp- man wandering alone at night. Hawthorne's examining the body now.  There's even less of him than of Singh.
Have you ever failed?
Meant to ask you- the railroad car trap. Your idea?  Excellent notion- I used the same device myself once.
Yes. And I'll be in some distant tree where I can provide no assistance whatsoever.  Can you control your fear?
I never thought I'd say this, but I'm glad you came.
We should construct thorn fences around every tent area. Fires burning at night.
I do, actually; very much.
Why do you laugh?- you don't believe she taught me?
Every day I ask you, and every day you've got something else to do.  Do I have bad breath or something?
Hundreds of people.  Believe me, I didn't imagine this.
Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of this to Peter if you don't mind.
You're also a human being, Frank.
Okay, that's no problem.
Peter, this is serious.  I need to know if you think there's anything unusual about him.
Don't worry about me.  I'm like a cat.
I'm El Gato.  I always land on my feet.
Be careful on that sofa -- it's a butt-biter. But the bed's good and I just changed the sheets so if you get tired, feel free.  In fact, I think you should definitely plan on spending the night here.
Are you all squeaky clean now?
Does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow, or could you hold off for a few days maybe?
For one night in your life, do you think it's possible for us to be completely real?
Thank you.  If I had that kind of support on a daily basis, I could definitely shape up by the turn of the century.
It may have been a room on the spacecraft made up to look like a room in the Holiday Inn.  I can't be sure, Peter.
Before you go running to the newspapers with this, would you consider telling this slime thing to some people downtown?
Oh migod!  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to do that.  It was an accident.
What are you doing up here?
I don't think we should leave her alone.
Dr. Venkman?  Dana is not here.
Yes, the scourge --
Get on with it, counselor!
You were the one who got me in.
Okay, so can you tell us when it's going to happen or do we have to buy the book?
This year?  That's cutting it a little close, isn't it?  I mean, just from a sales point of view, the book just came out, right?  So you're not even looking at the paperback release for maybe a year.  And it's going to be at least another year after that if the thing has movie-of-the-week or mini-series potential. You would have been better off predicting 1992 or even '94 just to be safe.
That's it?  "I'll be back?"
I'm Egon --
I can't believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there's no way back. Sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy. And there are too many people who'd just as soon step on your face as look at you.  But there've got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned-out burg.  We just have to mobilize it.
So, no goat hooves, huh?
Who?  Just -- someone we know.
You know he ran that last lap in under six minutes?
Don't tell me, let me guess.  All-you-can-eat barbecue rib night at the Sizzler?
We're going down into the sewer system to see if we can trace the source of the psycho-reactive slime flow.  We thought you might want to come along.
That's it, Ray.  I've had it.  No more parties. I'm tired of taking abuse from over-privileged nine-year-olds.
Huh?  What?
Are you all right?
You better watch your mouth, man, or I'll punch your lights out.
Ray -- Ray -- How do you feel, man?
Roy?  Your clock broke.
Hey, sweetheart, will you CUT THAT OUT!!!
Incredible!  Five for five.  You're not cheating on me here, are you?
Fine, Louis.  We'll stop in for a drink.
Well, let's check it out.
I'll cancel the reservation,  I found the name "Zuul" in ...  The Roylance Guide to Secret Societies and Sects.  I don't suppose you've  read it.
I'll pick you up at your place.  I'll bring along the Roylance Guide -- we can read after we eat.
Well, I'll just use it for a while and get it right back to you.
Fine.  This University will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your group's activities.
Dr. Venkman, we believe that the purpose of science is to serve mankind.  You, however, seem to regard science as some kind of "dodge" or "hustle."  Your theories are the worst kind of popular tripe, your methods are sloppy and your conclusions are highly questionable.  You're a poor scientist, Dr. Venkman, and you have no place in this department or in this University.
That's very fascinating to me.  I read a lot myself.  Some people think I'm too intellectual.  But I think reading is a fabulous way to spend your spare time.  I also play racketball.  Do you ever play?
Die in what sense?
Why don't you step into the office and we'll talk about it.  Hold all my calls, Janine.
Thank you for coming so quickly.  The guests are starting to ask questions and I'm running out of excuses.
Did you ever report it to anyone?
In a storage facility.
Yes, it would.
And may I see this storage facility?
Mr. Mayor, it's a pretty simple choice. You can believe Mr. Pecker here ...
A square?
Well, just 75 more to go.  What's this one?
You volunteered, didn't you?  Aren't we paying you for this?
Yes?
Oh, this is big, Peter.  This is very big. There's definitely something here.
Spengler, are you serious about actually catching a ghost?
I'm always serious.
Some.  I just met the Keymaster.  He's here with me now.  Venkman?  Are you there?
Let me guess -- Gozer Worshippers.
Excuse me for a minute.  Ray, I'm right in the middle of something here.  Can you come back in about an hour?
What is it?
I don't know.  Talk to it.
What do I say?
They will.
How do you know?
I guess they don't build them like they used to, huh?
We're nearly there, Lucilla.
No one in Rome has ever heard of him.  Do you want to remind those few in the Senate who have?  The whole sordid thing is far beneath your position to begin with.  Forget about him.
Kill him!  Tribuus -- execute that bastard.
Lykas, pick a man.  Someone who will look good.  Jerses I want it built up in the Daily Action...
Damn him!  I should have killed him on the front -- I let you talk me out of that.
Welcome back from your great triumph Narcissus Meridas.  My father sends his heart felt praise.  Sadly, Marcus is in dark humors -- nothing to worry about, but he needs rest. Likely just the weather.
Do you expect Marcus to be well enough by morning for an audience?
But they're not destroyed, not yet.
You and my father have become very close.  Perhaps one day I may say the same for us.
You flatter me, Caesar.
The army is a problem.  They love you.  You have led them from victory to victory in the name of Rome and they love you.  And after all, you're just a hothead acting from a misguided sense of loyalty -- who could fault you for that?  Thus have I reached a compromise with the Senate over your fate: instead of executing you, I'm sending you to Rome where you will be tried...
Give away food?
Sacks of grain, even bread.  I own the grain licenses for the military, I can arrange to divert a shipment bound for the army of the Danube.
Take grain away from the army?
Underdog!  How can he be an underdog -- he wins all the time!  I'm the emperor why can't I kill him?  He could be poisoned, or somehow killed to look like an accident.
Why isn't he dead?  Damn you, you promised me he would be dead!
Yes, Caesar.
But have never been?
You're a citizen and a soldier.  Not a gladiator.
I've made so many mistakes, Narcissus.  We all put off the very last duties of our lives because we're afraid of admitting when our lives are over.
It's not because he's young, it's because he's ignorant and arrogant. His sister is a better man.  That's why I have undertaken to begin sweeping changes in the relationship between the emperor and the Senate.
On your honor as a Roman officer, daddy?
Why don't we try to keep politics out of the conversation.
My troops don't make policy.
You brought the army into Rome.
What about their philosophy lessons?
They're studying with Cynics.
The battle is over.  The war is over.  You've won!
Very fancy.  Did you design the bottle?
How long do you think Commodus will let us live once he's in power?  A month?  Half a year?  Paestum will be a prison where he'll hold us until it's time...
Do you want to see Themis and Manto butchered?  If I die fighting Commodus he won't care about you. If I live I'll come and get you.
I am the man who might save your life -- give you a bit more life at any rate.  I am Proximo Palindromos head of this gladiatorial school which is named after me.  I own this school and everything that's in it.  You're in it!  But why?  What did a Roman general do to get himself condemned to the Colosseum? Understand, we usually get corn thieves and pick pockets.  Please, I separated you from the others because...  ... my nose tells me you've been condemned for important reasons.
Condemned?  Aren't I owed a trial before being condemned?
You put this inside your shirt -- when Tiger stabs your stomach -- it's full of pig's blood.  Gushes out everywhere!  It's really impressive.  Fantastic!  Better than the real thing!
Pressures on, eh Proximo?  There's got to be a load of money in this. Why else would you toss a red hot commodity like me out the window?
No.  Tell them I'll do it.  But I want more posters all over Rome.
Then get a large cash advance.
I want another interview with Cos. Tell him to bring plenty of ink.
Why not?
No -- why should I?
Is anything wrong?
All right.
You sure you really want to?
Maybe we could get together some time and talk about it.
I don't understand --
Then what?
No. I have two. The other one is the one I'm looking for.  What's this?  It's from my grandmother.
What are you going to do now?
I don't want you to go anywhere until you have a definite plan.
I might.
I don't know.
Well -- look -- don't be confused. We're getting married.
Why do you have to see him?
Well, what did he say? I'm curious.
Exactly how do you mean?
Yes, I will.
It's all right, Mr. McCleery.
Could I make one phone call first?
Yes.
Come to the railing and I'll hand it up.
Mrs. Robinson -- I don't quite know how to put this --
Where are you?
-- and I was wondering if I could buy you a drink or something --
What?
Sir?
I'll have a porter show you the room.
Oh. Well actually, I'd just as soon find it myself. I just have the toothbrush to carry up and I think I can manage it myself.
Oh -- no. I'm just sort of disturbed about things.
What?
No. 
What do you drink? Bourbon?
Mrs. Robinson, you didn't -- I mean you didn't expect --
It's not all right, it's the worst thing I've ever said to anyone.
What is wrong with me?
Her portrait?
Yes.
I don't remember her as having brown eyes.
Yes?
Then why do you keep running away?
But I just -- Look -- what if Mr. Robinson walked in right now?
What if he did?
Yes. Yes. Let me out!
You? Oh no. No. I'll get it.
Yes -- I think that would be good.
Yes?
Yes.
What?
Thank you.
Sure. Shall I -- I mean shall I just stand here? I mean -- I don't know what you want me to do.
Why don't you watch?
Either one will be fine.
That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson. That's really a laugh. Ha ha.
Are you kidding?
Wait a minute!
-- of bring -- inadequate -- I mean just because you happen to be inadequate in one way --
Well?
Then why do you want to talk about it?
What one.
What do you say to him?
Because he takes sleeping pills. He takes three sleeping pills every night at ten o'clock.
But what about the noise from the car. What if --
Now let's keep going here.
Right.
Oh no. Are you kidding me?
Wait a minute. So you wouldn't say you loved him.
Well how do you feel about him, then?
Is it?
No.
Well I can't.
I can't see why you did, unless... you didn't have to marry him or anything, did you?
Don't tell Elaine.
Oh no. You had to marry him because you got pregnant?
Well I never thought of you and Mr. Robinson as the kind of people who...
What?
Oh my God.
Really. I want to know.
But why shouldn't I?
Because -- Mrs. Robinson this is the sickest, most perverted thing that ever happened to me. And you do what you want but I'm getting the hell out.
Well two minutes ago you told me I wasn't good enough for your daughter. Now you say you're sorry I got that impression.
What are you doing?
Oh no.  Look -- I like you. I wouldn't keep coming here if I didn't like you.
This is absurd.
Promise me, Benjamin.
Now it seems to me --
Hello. Get me the police, please.
I'm sorry we won't be able to invite you to the wedding, Benjamin, but the arrangements have been so rushed --
I say I've got it.
Yes. Well -- goodnight.
When I go off?
You don't have to tell me if you don't want.
Not if you don't want to.
Why?
Well -- it's very comfortable -- just to drift here.
Have you thought about graduate school?
You got me.
Standing guard over the old castle, are you?
Twenty. I'll be twenty-one next week.
I know.
What?
In many ways I feel as though you were my own son.
Oh yes.
Ben -- I want you to give her a call.
Oh -- not too much. Taking it easy.
What would you say to a short one? Bourbon still your drink?
No, it's not --
It was nothing to do with you, sir.
Shaking hands. Well, that's not saying much for my wife, is it?
It's Benjamin.
Yes?
Dad -- could we just talk about this for a second?
You've been waiting your chance. You're too much of a gentleman -- that's the trouble with you.
Need any help?
No --
Get out and leave it to me... be ready to leave on the night train for Amsterdam...
With the pearls?
Oh -- work!!
Tea would spoil my dinner.  One meal a day, I'd hate to spoil it.
Money -- Ever heard of it?
Shall we say five o'clock -- downstairs?
Yes -- oh!
And then --?
You mustn't talk Russian to me.
Not quite strange now. It is as if I had been expecting you. You know, once when the Grand Duke was alive, I found a man hiding in my room -- a young officer --
You could love me. It is so long since I have heard that word. Nobody has loved me for a long time. It is so icy-cold to be famous. One is so cruelly alone. How is it that you -- Let me look at you. Your hands. Your eyes. Why could you love me?
Really?
And?
That's a silly joke.
I don't want them now.
So --
I want to be good to you -- madly good.
Oh no -- that would spoil everything. I'll -- I will manage somehow -- I'll manage myself. I will go with you. When does the train leave?
Are you coming to the theatre? Oh -- I shall dance tonight -- How I shall dance -- I want to feel that you are in the theatre.
I'm Baron von Gaigern.
Then you know him?
Baron, we must have gone a hundred miles an hour, at least...
I'm going to change and we'll meet for a drink in the Yellow Room.
If I could get into a game I might win some.
No -- not at all.
That was my last.
Well -- last night was not so good.
That is Doctor Otternschlag -- You know him?
Aha! -- The Baron. What do you want here?
Hello! Hello! --
No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought. 
For me?
No -- no -- not yet. Well, I mustn't let it interfere with my duty. Any news here?
Man -- that's terrible. He was a nice fellow -- I am sorry about him.
Life! -- Mr. Kringelein, you are drunk -- good night. 
More than fourteen thousand marks... were in that pocketbook.
Oh, I've got to find it.
You're trembling.
Quick -- Mr. Kringelein.
Oh -- oh, Miss Flaemmchen. It's you --
I didn't like Preysing right off.
I'm the stenographer.
Movies?
You're a little too fast.
Is that Mrs. Preysing.
What do you think your salary would be -- for such a trip?
You are late. I've been waiting for you -- waiting.
I couldn't do that, you're a stranger to me.
We have a good many connections in England, naturally.
Then, it's all over?
As you remember it -- when you approached us...
Madam should sleep.
When a lady falls in love she does her hair differently.
I suppose I can cancel the Vienna engagement.
Good morning, Pimenov.
Gru -- you are positively radiant.
He will be on the train.
Mr. Kringelein will take room number one-seventy-six, one of our most expensive rooms. It is large and on the front with bath.
Do you think you have free license to be insulting? Believe me you have not. You think you're superior, but you're quite an ordinary man.
Me?
Where is that girl -- she was working with him -- she enticed me into her room.
Terrible. After this, no more ballets for me. Jazz --  Just jazz.
Ach! Here you are, Doctor Zinnowitz.
Have I kept you waiting?
Everything depends on the Manchester merger.
I know -- I know.
I want to dictate my statement for tomorrow. I can't speak without notes. I like to have things down before me in black and white.
'Deal with Manchester definitely off! "Preysing, oh -- I'd never have thought it of you.
I can understand that -- after your -- uh --
I want to see her, I want to do some dictating -- report of the conference for my father-in-law.
Your what?
You mean, the insurance frammis?
You hit a person with the oranges in the towel, they get big, awful looking bruises, but they don't really get hurt, not if you do it right. It's for working scams against insurance companies.
You want a drink?
That's right. Take a little, leave a little.
Worries about his mother, eh? Give him a hug for me.
Mary Beth! This has never been anything but --
And I don't just mean the SEC. We could have the FBI breathing down our necks.
Mrs. Dillon, your son was in some sort of accident. He's had an internal hemorrhage, he's bleeding to death inside.
I know.
It was a gift. It isn't worth anything at all?
When I said you being the best salesman here didn't say much, I meant for us. I know your record with Sarber and Webb, and I'd say you're a top-flight man, but you've had no incentive. No one walking on your heels. Just a lot of half asses, so the tendency's been not to stretch yourself. I'm bouncing the slobs, incidentally.
You're turning me down? Makes no sense, Roy.
Okay, fine. Perk, the truth is, I like things the way they are now. Pick my own hours, have time for, uh, other activities...
That's what we'll do, then. But I tell you what, Roy. Before I hire anybody else, I'll ask you one last time. Fair enough?
Whatever you say. The manager says your boss called.  Really pulled the wool over everybody's eyes, huh?
My boss is a guy named Bobo Justus, back in Baltimore. When a long shot gets too much action, I have to put money on that horse at the track, because it's the only way to get the odds down.
Why?
I just give you your life. What you do with it is up to you.
Four grand. For the hospital. Is that enough?
Roy, I don't want money from you.
Bobo won't be. He'll spend the money to make sure.
No.
I wouldn't go in on a deal with her. She blamed you for it.
I'm sorry. I hated to take your money, but --
Just a few bucks.
I know what's bugging you, of course.
I wonder did you ever think about it from my side.
I don't see why not.
Well, uh...
Sure, sure, that doesn't count. That's different.
Joe, I thought I was gonna be all right by now, I just need a little more --
Joe, could we talk it over? Do you want a drink?
Scram. Go home.
I can't. I just left home.
Are you sure?
Look at me.
I want to know everything about you.
I just do what the doctor says, babe.
I'll pay Lilly back, don't you worry about that.
The tap. What you do for a living.
It was beautiful. And getting better all the time.
Upstate where?
I just bet you are, too. And now you're trying to rope me.
Join up with you! I watched you, Roy, I've been watching you, wondering if I should talk about this at all, or maybe just... 
Running your broker scam, you mean.
But why not? I thought it was settled. What's holding you back?
And hello to you, too.
But the setup's there. It's there now.
Mostly, because you scare the shit out of me. I've seen people like you before, baby. Double-tough and sharp as they come, and you get what you want or else. But you don't make it work forever.
) What?
I realize this is a shock.
That's natural.
I grant you, it's a little odd, shoot yourself with a gun with a silencer on it, but it was hers, all right. It really is your mother, Mister Dillon.
What?
Someone who knows her well could still identify her, that's not the problem. It's just there's, uh, it's likely to be a shock.
Unable to escape, she turns and attacks the killer, but doesn't connect.
It's Blake.  Meet me at Grand View.
You take all your dates here. Blake?
Mind if we sit down?
What the fuck are you talking about?
No shit?!
And I should have a son who calls me "Mom".  Looks like we're both shit out of luck.
The dorms are only fifty feet away.  You could practically see into my window.  So, what difference does it make?
Shit, John!  What the hell were you doing out there?!
Yeah, me too, Keri.
Keri.... Laurie... how about if I just call you Mom?
Not me.
A box of fortune cookies... I'm running out of advice.
Who?
Keri, you all right?
Shane's going as a condom.
I thought you were allergic to latex.
Answer what?
Promise?
What is it this time?
He told me about the terrible things that happened here.  In our house.
Runes were a kind of early alphabet that originated in Northern Europe thousands of years ago.  They were symbols -- carved out of stone or pieces of wood.  Of all the runes, Thorn had the most negative influence. Cults used them in blood rituals to portend future events and invoke magic.
What now?!
What is that?
Sam, don't -- let them take care of her.
Where's the child?
Why did you take Jamie?
What do you know about Michael?
I know he's alive.  People in this town -- they want us to believe he's dead.  But I know. I've always known.
It's a bitch.
No.
Looseleaf--will you get the hell home?
Go home!
You were rich before.  This is the first time I was ever rich.
Go home!  Show them how rich you are for a change!
Let's talk about it some other time.
I didn't know we had any women left.
Of course you'll go!  You're going to fly the helicopter.
Sorry.  At least you've got a place to come back to.  I don't have a place to come back to anymore.
What's this?
The posies are for her?
What an awful sound!
Selling vacuum cleaners isn't the best preparation you could have.
Out!
You--you aren't going to have any friends left, if you don't watch out.
Ask it!
You don't know where your mother is? Does she put on a short skirt and go drinking all night?
And you've been roaming the streets while your mother is God-knows-where?
Man and boy.
Everybody says he was so brave.
No.
"Dad?"  Dad.  The boy wants tales of derring-do. Name a country.
Oh hell.
Behind a desk for a little while.  A desk!  They had him planning air raids.  A city can't flee like a coward or fight like a man, and the choice between fleeing and fighting was at the core of the life of Harold Ryan.  There was only one thing he enjoyed more than watching someone make that choice, and that was making the choice himself.  Ask about Spain, where he was the youngest soldier in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.  He was a famous sniper.  They called him "La Picadura"--"the sting."
Wow.
We blacked our hands and faces.  At midnight we crept out of the forest and into the village.  The name of the village was Mhravitch. Remember that name!
Go on.
We caught another Kraut alone in a back lane.  Your father choked him to death with a length of piano wire.  Your father was quite a virtuoso with piano wire.  That's nicer than a knife, isn't it--as long as you don't look at the face afterwards.  The face turns a curious shade of avocado.  I must ask the doctor why that is.  At any rate, we stole into the back of the inn, and, with the permission of the management, we poisoned the wine of six Krauts who were carousing there.
The Germans shot everybody who lived there, then leveled it, plowed it, planted turnips and cabbages in the fertile ground. They wished revenge for the slaying of the Beast of Yugoslavia.  To their twisted way of thinking, your father had butchered an Eagle Scout.  Play lots of contact sports?
Does it bother you to have your mother engaged to a man like that?
Is Looseleaf Harper alive?
A hundred dollars!
Destiny often seems that way. You're going to marry me.
My parents died in an automobile accident when I was sixteen years old.  They left me a brewery and a baseball team--and other things.  I live for a living.  I've just come back from Kenya--in Africa.  I've been hunting Mau Mau there.
Like hugging a lamp post.
Harold!
I could carve a better man out of a banana!
He doesn't deserve this!  You don't know him.  It isn't fair!
He hasn't had breakfast yet.
You used to like it stark!
That is the most heartless statement I ever heard pass between human lips.
People don't use that word any more.
That's what you're supposed to say.
I'd like to have the expert opinion of the fish--along with yours.
His most cherished possession?  His violin, I guess.
Your clothes are at the city dump by now.  Perhaps you can get a map from the Department of Sanitation.
More nerve than the doctor, I must admit.  He hasn't been home for two days.  Has he suddenly lost interest in sleep and color television--and the violin?
Well--what have we here?  A family.
I bought him a twenty-two yesterday--on the way home from Hamburger Heaven.  And where is the good doctor?  Have you two feathered a love nest somewhere?
It seems highly intelligent to me.
What kind of a country has this become?  The men wear beads and refuse to fight--and the woman adore them.  America's days of greatness are over.  It has drunk the blue soup.
If he thinks he's man enough.
If that's the case--what's to prevent my killing myself?
I feel mocked, insulted, with no sort of satisfaction in prospect. We don't have to fight with steel. I can fight with words.  I'm not an inarticulate ape, you know, who grabs a rock for want of a vocabulary.  Call him up in East St. Louis, Penelope.  Tell him to come here.
Whoever has the gun, you see, gets to tell everybody else exactly what to do.  It's the American way.
Of course he can go--if he'll just go down on his hands and knees for a moment--and promise me that he does not find me comical in the least degree.
Hello?  Oh--hello, Mother.
Look--this isn't my apartment, and there isn't anybody else here.  Mrs. Ryan won't be home for a while.
Will you please go?  An emergency!
And you come into Mrs. Ryan's apartment as often as you please, looking into various health matters?
You wish the woman good luck, and you tell the man how fortunate he is.  That's how it goes.
I know malaria.  Malaria isn't caused by the bites of bats.
This little corpse is intended as a lesson?
This is man to man.
Oooooo.  That hurt.
I haven't told you, Harold, how comical I think you are.
If you're at home in the ooze, and nowhere else.
You hope.
Can I beg for mercy--on my knees?
It's trash now, like mine.
Use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
I dunno, boy.
Alice got married again.
No, no--shit no.  Excuse me, Penelope.
Won't you please join our club? Please?
I heard you were looking for me.
Is it?  I have this theory about why men kill each other and break things.
What's this?
Don't touch me.  Get out of the way.
Stay home tonight!
Who have you been talking to?
No.
Or was.  We haven't done anything wrong, you know.
This conversation took place, incidentally, about three months before Harold was declared legally dead.
He ditched me.  He started running, and I started running, then he lost me in the park.
I didn't make my move fast enough. That's it, isn't it?  I was too respectful.
You were wonderful.
Herb Shuttle is taking me to a fight.
As long as he keeps out of the park.
After this explosion, I think, he'll be able to accept the fact that his mother is going to marry again.
If you warned him against it as much as you say, it's almost a certainty.
It's suicide!
I'm amazed.
He's not your son.
I'm taking her to the airport a few minutes from now.  She's going to East St. Louis--to visit an aunt.
That's not true either--or needn't be, unless we make it true.
It's good.  Let him go.
We have enough for a shuffleboard team.  In Heaven, shuffleboard is everything.  Hitler plays shuffleboard.
Lewis Carroll, who wrote Alice in Wonderland, plays shuffleboard.
We're going to have jackets, aren't we?
There's no evidence of any foul play at present. I hope she's just a runaway.
I heard you the first time. We had nothing to go on with this kid. Just a runaway.  Do you really think he's in danger?
We aren't gonna arrest him for that...
Look, that twenty dollars you just paid, I don't get any of that. That goes to the guys that own this place. I get two bucks an hour, minus ten percent for a bail fund. I make all my money on tips.
Sure. What do you want? Tips can be anywhere from thirty dollars to seventy dollars.
Now, what do you want?
I like it, Mr. Van Dorn.
Not really. But if you want me to tone it down...
You kidding? Three days work. I finish tonight.
Sure. Like in Mikey and Niki. Did you see that picture?
Do I know you? Weren't you on the set the other night? With Ramada.
She's dead.
At least I'm a growing person.
Did you ever live in a room with six people and you didn't have any money, any food, any furniture? Have your brother come out, his car break down, he can't get a job? Your friends stealing food, going through trash behind a supermarket?
But it's all you do.
What does that mean?  What does he do?
Wait, wait. I'm trying to figure this out. This is like Rona Barrett. Before you become saved, God already knows who you are?
Do you live in a house back in wherever.
Grand Rapids? Of course.
Don't get upset. I lied too. I don't make no five hundred dollars a week. Everything I make goes to Granville.
Look, Niki, this really isn't my business. I don't know anything about...
Hello?
That's like a stag film.
Yeah.  All over. Even here in Grand Rapids.
Where is she?
Like what?
Andy, can you do something for her? Maybe money...
What?
That's not true, Mr...?
Where is she? Where is the girl?
Where does he hang out?
Yeah.
You're talking about real excitement?
That film was a fake! Everything's phony...
Do you have a, ah, film called 'Slave of Love?'
Oh.  Why is it that you want to get into film financing?
I got a picture here. I want you to tell me where to find this woman. I been asking everybody. Nobody knows anything.
I don't know.
I'm worried about Jake.
He didn't look good at all. Something strange is going on. He's got himself into some trouble. He wouldn't say what.
No, Andy. Don't know the kid.
How long have you been driving?
Well, it's not really mine. I dug it up in front of the courthouse. We're transplanting it. Letting it breathe, you know. But, of course, we would like to get it into soil, as soon as possible.
Oh, don't get officious. You're not yourself when you're officious. That's the curse of a government job.
Lady, is it true you're driving without a license?
Edith was just telling me about her job.
Harold Chasen.
How do you do? I am Dame Marjorie Chardin, but you may call me Maude.
Well, it's a new experience for me.  Good on curves. Shall I take you home, Harold?
All right.
My door is always open.
What do you think?
You look as if you could.
That's the influence of the right food, the right exercise, and the right breathing.  Greet the dawn with the Breath of Fire!  Of course, there's no doubt the body is giving out. I'm well into autumn. I'll have to be giving it all up after Saturday. Sweeten the tea with honey, Harold. It's delicious.
I should like to change into a sunflower most of all. They are so <u>tall</u> and simple. And you, Harold, what flower would you like to be?
What?
What is it?
Yes, you're right. We'll go see Glaucus. Come on.
We'll come back in the morning.
An ice sculpture. It's Venus - the Goddess of Love, the completion of which is his unfulfilled dream.
I like Glaucus.
Well --  - they say he was very wise, so I'm sure he must have.
You are the wisest person I know.
From the guys who got the matches, of course. 
I was remembering how much this meant to me. It was after the war... I had nothing... except my life. How different I was then - and yet how the same.
I put a lot of effort into these things.
And a lot of time.
Oh. Well, how do you spend your day?
No. It's the junk. I like to look at junk.
That's very interesting, Harold, and I think very illuminative. There seems to be a definite pattern emerging.  Your fondness for useless machines and demolitions seems indicative of your present emotional state, your self-destructive urges and your alienation from the regular social interaction. What do you think? And of course this pattern once isolated can be coped with. Recognize the problem and you are half way on the road to its solution. But tell me, what do you do for <u>fun</u>? What activity gives you a different sense of enjoyment than the others? What do you find fulfilling? What gives you that certain satisfaction?
No.
No.  I'd have liked to.
Yes, sir.
To kill. The taste of blood in your mouth.
The moment of truth.
Another man's life in your sights.
Souvenirs?
Oh, Kirsty; so eager to play, so reluctant to admit it.
What's the matter with her?
Well, the sofa isn't often used for sleeping on...
The boxes! I TOLD you.
WHY?
I'm scared.
That's all for you, Sammy.
See? I don't like that --
Do you believe in hell?
What the hell was that? An ape?
Every time the media get a look at him, they come to me. I'm running out of lies, Trevor.
Well, I won't be around forever, you know?
It is. You got yourself on TV again.
You'd better stay here. I'll find a way out. We'll come back for you.
Whatcha looking at, John??
C'mon, time to go home. Tape you up.
What was that??
Out? Out out?
You're going alone?
He's just pushy.
Strong.
Pardon?
Wait! Wait! Watch the fucking paint work.
You fucking ass-holes.
Eh, Chas, slow it down like the man says.
Got her mother's looks.
Julia's my second wife.
He doesn't see us, or hear us. We belong to you, Kirsty. And you to us.
No.
Oh my God.
I'm brother Frank.
Well can I come in or not?
Well?
Help me.
Who?
Who did?
You're still afraid.
They took my body, but my spirit... they left that here. In the boards, in the walls. Watching the world, but not able to TOUCH it.
You can't love him.
Sure.
You're still blaming me.
Would you excuse me? I think I'm going to go to bed.
Larry...
Please.
Am I?
Oh Christ.
What a pretty tune.
I'll come over and see you in the next few days. You can show me the mansion. O.K.?
O.K. I'll be nice. You get on with the muscle work. I'll make myself some coffee.
I just wanted to be sure you were O.K.
It's like she's waiting for something.
Finished?
I don't believe it.
Get the fuck out of here.
PLEASE. You're in danger.
Your father told me you were working here.
I hate to quibble with you Rob, but she married her first boyfriend. Kevin Bannister.
Rob.  Top five musical crimes perpetrated by Stevie Wonder in the '80's and '90's.  Subquestion -- is it in fact unfair to criticize a formerly great artist for his latter- day sins?  "Is it better to burn out than to fade away?"
Oh, so what's the point then?
What did he ever do to you?
What?
"Thunder Road," Bruce Springsteen, from Born to Run. "Smells Like Teen Spirit," Nirvana, Nevermind.
Just... come on, what would it mean to you?  That sentence? "I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet?"
...But the word "yet..." Yeah, you know what, I'd get the impression that you wanted to see it.  Otherwise you'd say you didn't really want to.
My band.
The band that found me and asked me to join.
You are not in a band, Barry.  You are not a musician.  And no posters.
Great!  That's fucking great!  They only asked you to sing because of your name!  You can stick it above the browser racks over there.
So much for friends, then.  You're a bitter bastard, Rob, you know that?
No way.
No.  We need the gig.
Why not?
I have a television.
No.  The Righteous Brothers.
Isn't her album called "Number Four With A Smile?"
Anna.
Anna who?  Anna Green Gables?  Anna Conda?
Don't do it, Rob!
Where's Rob?
Oh.  Okay.
What I mean is, I didn't mean you look young.  You don't.  You don't look old either.  You look just as old as you are.  A bit younger maybe, but not a lot.  Not much.  Just right.
Pardon me?
Oh boy... In the club, or at home?
Fantastic but I'm a little busy right now.  Listen.  Do you want to come to dinner Saturday?  I'm having some friends over and I need a spare man. Are you a spare man?
Uh...yes, at the moment.
Did you tell that to Marco when he did his what-does-it-all-mean thing with you?
No, that's okay.  Really.
What's this?
Laura?  Are you okay?
We are not talking jokey understatement here, Rob.  We're talking actionable harassment.  Ten phone calls a night, hanging around outside my house...
Just the obvious stuff.
No.  So.  Is it working out with Ian?
Look.  Maybe you'll grow up and we'll get it together, you and me.  Maybe I'll never see either of you again. I don't know.  All I know is that it's not a good time to be living here.
I don't know.
Well if you could tell me roughly it would help.
Well.  Sex, I guess.  Is sex with him better?
Jesus Christ, Rob.  Is that really what's bothering you?
Never?
I'll bet you can't remember what you were doing here, can you?  I mean, how much are you making now?  Sixty? Seventy?  And you were living in this shitty place.
Those aren't mine.
Sure they are.
They're not really, though, are they? I know you bought them for me, and that was really sweet of you, but that was when you were trying to turn me into you.  I can't take them, I know they'd just sit around staring at me, and I'd feel embarrassed by them and... they don't fit in with the rest of what's mine, do you understand?  That Sting record you bought for me... that was a present for me.  I like Sting and you hate him.  But the rest of this stuff...  Who the hell is Nick Lowe?  Or Gram Parsons?  Or the Boredoms?  I don't know these people.  I...
I guess I am.
I can't talk right now.
Don't worry about it.  Just get into bed.  Worry about that when you're better.
I'm sorry.
Look, are you coming or not?
Yes, of course.
I don't know.  Sometime.  Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?
What?
Hi.
You know, with Ray...
What about Ian?
C'mon.  I want to know.
Look, we're okay now.  We just had a nice time.  Let's leave it at that.
Fantastic.  The Girlfriend Lottery.
I'm alright.
WHAT?
Well forgive me if I don't think of you as the world's safest bet.
Shut up.  I'm only trying to explain.
To think I sympathized with you for two seconds!  Poor Rob!  Laura left him out of nowhere for the schmuck upstairs.  You let me believe that!
What difference does it make?
So you live in Chicago now?
Yeah, but you know what's his best film and nobody's even seen it?
Yeah?
Mom!  For the last fucking time, I'm telling you Laura didn't want to get married!  She is not that kind of girl!  To use a phrase.  That's not what happens now.
And you must not be getting along too well right now, huh?
Look.  Can I pay you properly?  You don't have to tell him what you got. Send him forty-five bucks and blow the rest.  Give it to charity.  Or something.
Seventy-five.
Eleven-hundred.  That's my lowest offer.
Well we don't.
I'm Vince.
How old is Richard?
Taupin, isn't that the guy Moran picked up the other night?
Why?
Poor little tyke didn't have a chance.  Hopelessly premature.  He died a few days after he was born.
The boy _died_?
Have you spoken to anyone else about this?
Miss Cartwright, what is it I can do for you?
Is this what you killed them with?
Then you must be at least 70 years old.
It's frightening sometimes the way you talk about other people's lives.
Why are you here?
Who are you?
Sometimes innocents become involved.
You and your buddy make a real team, don't you?  Exchanging eloquent threats in iambic pen- tameter while hacking up all the innocents in between.
Forget it.
A murder.
What are you going to tell them?  That you're protecting a man who's killed four people?
But we might just give it the 'ole college try.  What with the court back ups, it could be days before you got an arraignment. But then, I'm sure the flunk-out neice of the D.A. knows all about that.
You're an asshole, Moran.
What were you doing in Felton?
It's that important?
Good way to lose your job.
-Auditorium nostrum-
Afternoon.
Aye.
I haven't much to offer, Mr. Romirez from Spain, but you're welcome to what's here.
Hmm, que rico.  What is it you call this?
I don't understand.
You are not dead, boy.  Accept it.
This is monstrous.  I'll burn in hell for all eternity.
Why does he want to kill me?
This power is divided amongst you, me, and others like cuts in a pie. But the cuts are not equal.  Some, like you and he, have more.  Much more.
Who?
That's mad.  Surely you don't take their word?
I don't know, Conor.  It's not natural.  Maybe something has touched you.
State of grace and all that.
Help?  I've seen others "help". Somehow a head always ended up on the counter.
Here.  The hook should go just below the head, where the meat is toughest.
Figure she's with him?
Think we should call the local P.D. out there first?
How many came?
_Answer_ me.
Tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of value we have.  All else is just marking time.  You're marking time.
Run!
Perhaps Miss Cartwright would like to play.
Are you here?
And if I refuse?
What were _you_ looking for?
Seventy-five.
Sort of a Jack London style?
I said -- uh -- I said even ten minutes -- is a long time -- to be away from you.
Say, what's happened to Burns? He looks sunk, doesn't he?
And what's the matter with a thousand dollars?
According to the budget, we laid out that's more than our food bill for a whole year. Listen, Bruce, I don't want Walter Burns to use me, but I'm perfectly willing to use him. How long will it take to get him examined?
I'm sure you haven't any.
I know I got you into this, Hildy, but it does seem to me that you can't care much for me if you're willing to let me stay locked up for two hours.
Hildy! Where's mother?
Did you give her the money?
Just a second, Walter. Here, Bruce, here's the check... And, oh, Bruce, here's your wallet. I got it back.
How long would the interview take?
Well, you'll take care of her. After all, if that doctor's right, I'm going to live for a long time yet. Look, Bruce, this is a debt of honor. I was a very bad husband: Hildy could have got a lot of alimony if she'd wanted to, but she wouldn't take any. She had it coming to her, but she was too independent.
Well, of course, if you put it that way.
Gee, you almost make me feel like a heel -- coming between you.
Oh, sure.  Well, thanks for everything.
Hildy!
Oh, this is all right, Bruce. I just wanted to be sure.
I'll show you what I'm doing. Burns, you're guilty of obstructing justice and so is the Morning Post. I'm going to see that the Post is fined ten thousand dollars for this.
All the lawyers in the world aren't going to help you!
How long is what?
You know what. How long since we've seen each other?
Let's see. I was in Reno six weeks -- then Bermuda... Oh, about four months, I guess. Seems like yesterday to me.
I notice you still remember it.
Done what?
Deny it! I'm proud of it! We beat the whole country on that story.
You mean you're not coming back to work here?
Well, the paper'll have to learn to do without me. And so will you. It just didn't work out, Walter.
What's the matter?
There's nobody else on the paper who can write! This'll break me, unless --  Hildy!
You've got to help me, Hildy.
Who says I can't? You're a newspaper man.
It's a good, honest business, isn't it?
Here's luck to the bride and bridegroom.
No, Bruce, dear. Don't you see? This is a trick to get your sympathy. No, Walter, I've been waiting for something like this -- but I wasn't sure when you'd spring it. If you want to save Earl Williams' life, you can interview him yourself. You're still a good reporter. Bruce and I will be on that four o'clock train -- and thanks just the same.
What tricks would I pull?
I meant on my grandmother's grave. Don't be so technical, Hildy. What's the story?!
Where do you think you're going?
Oh, get off that trapeze!  There's your story! Smear it all over the front page -- Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post! And take all the credit -- I covered your story for you and I got myself in a fine mess doing it -- and now I'm getting out! I know I told you that twice before today -- but this time I mean it!
Wait a minute -- wasn't it Stanley who discovered Livingstone?
Bruce? Oh -- er -- he went out to get the tickets.
It's Fate, Hildy. What will be, will be.
No!
Worried! I was petrified. Weren't you?
In the Shoreland Hotel. And our only chaperon was the poor old lady's stomach.
Sorry, Hildy. I didn't mean to be making love to another man's fiancee.
Yeah. I suppose I could. But, Walter --
Flip a coin.
Hildy!
Yeah. Only -- only I'm not leaving, Walter.
On the nine o'clock train. That's the one he took, isn't it?
Sure.
Well, maybe I'd like to know just once!
How about Bruce's?
What do you mean, I handed her? The patrol wagon was on the wrong side of the street.
You got plenty of money?
What?
You're crazy. Where's Mac?
He's on my phone. He just called me.
Yes, shaking hands. I don't take a very good picture, though.
That must be the tenth alienist they've had on Williams. Even if he wasn't crazy before, he would be after ten of those babies got through psychoanalyzing him.  Gimme the desk.
How's everything, Gus?
Oh -- I'll take the same, I guess. And coffee.
I've got a right to carry a gun if I want to.
The names are Merwyn D. Mayor, who is the Mayor's brother-in-law --
I'm getting them for twelve dollars a night.
I know it! But they've got nothing to do with this case! Do you realize there are two hundred thousand votes at stake and unless we hang Earl Williams we're going to lose 'em?
Hold your horses -- will you, Olsen? Hurry up, Fred!
Look kind o' natural, don't they, Fred?
You drunken idiot! Arrest him! The idea of coming here with a cock-and- bull story like that!
And so do I!
All right. You can't. But tomorrow the Post will run the story of that roulette game on 43rd Street that your brother-in-law runs. And we'll print that you get five hundred a month for forgetting about it!
Who is it?
Well, Hildy, we were only saying that a swell reporter like you wouldn't give this up so easily.
You fight it cut.
Look out, you --
Oh, sure. The boss sent me over with it. Four hundred dollars, wasn't it?
Come on with that money!
So long, nothing! Where's Bruce Baldwin's wallet?
Hildy, I thought you were gone --
There's nothing crazy about that, is there?
Don't forget about production for use.
Oh, I'm awful tired. I couldn't go through another day like this.
They're newspaper men, Mollie. They can't help themselves. The Lord made them that way.
I'm coming!  Keep dead quiet. Don't even breathe.
If you ask us, no. If you ask the state alienists, the answer is yes.
What's your hurry?
Why?
What are you doing here? This is our territory
You want to join our gang?
Bugger off.
Bruce, look! Dad got some German jam.
The next one is ours. Either it hits us or it goes past us.
You said that last year, Dad.
What's that?
...two Indians to fan me all night. The heat.
Up to six weeks, I think.
It was the best time of his life.
Molly!
Almost there... are you in a hurry or something?
The door's locked. I'll gotta go around... wait here.
Aw, you ain't seen nothing yet.
A dead one.
Are you two gals all funny with each other?
Take that, you fucking slut!  Fucking redneck whore!
Great story Goober, how much?
Come on, bro. Let's go.
No, really.
I don't drive cross country.
Y'all find us country people real funny like don't ya... well, God damn pack up the mule and sling me some grits, I'ze a gotta get me some schooling.
She's pretty cute.
So, the guy goes to Hell and the devil says, "do you smoke?" The guy say, "yeah"... the devil say, "great cause Tuesday is cigar night, sweetest Cuban cigars you ever had."
She looks like she stinks.
OK, let's relax. I'll check it, maybe I'm wrong. Don't everybody freak out just yet.
I'll help ya.
Tire's fucking gone crap on us, man. There's no saving it now.
Honk at him. Scare him.
Forget it. I'll just go.
I gotta open the gate.
Well, I'll try but I don't know nothing 'bout nobody. I'm a guy who likes to mind his own business, if ya get what I'm saying.
Christ, ain't they all. All them retards wanna do is fuck and eat.
Worse than a fucking rabid baboon.
You sure you don't need any help in there?
This isn't everything. Get ready for this... there's a Museum of Murder and Mayhem.
Aw, come on. It will be fun.
It says, "records show that Ellie Thompson was born in 1914 of normal physical stature and lived a life of normal bearings, until such time that she was placed in the care of the Willows State Mental Facility."
Thank you.
Someone is out there...  ...help, we're in here!
No please, let me sit this one out.
Aw, it ain't crap... it's... cute.  ...and really who are we to judge the artistic merit of the tin-can Mona Lisa?
Scattered, smothered and covered.
Geez, he never gets tired does he.
Let's just skip it. It is probably nothing anyway.
You find something, Georgie?
What'd ya got there?
Open up the trunk.
Great. I thought I felt a certain attraction between Mary and Tiny soon as he walked in.
We hit the jackpot! Let's roll, good buddy. We got ourselves a convoy.
Doing what? Messy up your day? Well, fuck lady there are some bigger issues at hand... than your fucking have a nice fucking day bumper sticker shit!
Well hello, officer.
I'm sure there's more than that... fucking pigs always travel in packs...  ...here, take this.
No they couldn't, somebody had to see something.
We gotta break it open.
Jesus Christ.
Well, all we know is the kids were headed out to a spot the locals call Deadwood to play Nancy Drew with some local legend about this character everybody calls Dr. Satan.
Sounds like a bad idea to me, probally just get in the way.
That is the wrong fork, young man.  Harold, tell the boy.
Yeah, Natalie. It's hair. It grows.
Look, if you're going to be like that... You should be appreciative that I'm interested.
Why, because I'm a freak and you are beautiful, and you are being nice enough to come down to my freak, nonbeautiful level and act concerned about my repulsive troubles?
Hello, my little boy.
Oui. Nathan's silk suit, just like you asked.
You decide. Today is your day.
Oui. Perhaps I called at a bad time. I am sorry.
Is everything fine?
Maybe we should just sit for a while. It's very peaceful.
Really? No. Not at all. You're a very pretty girl. You should know that. You should be confident.
So soft. So smooth.  I'm sorry. It's just...
Well, I think it would be easier if I could talk to you in person.
What?
Well?
Please. I look a mess.
I've been seeing Johannsen in chemistry.
Of course not, that Swedish thief! He's a thief of hearts!  I love you, Gabrielle.
I have some thoughts. I think that hairy bitch is somewhere trying to turn him back into an ape.
It shan't happen again. I swear it. I'm just getting my sea legs, you know.
Tell me. I could use someone up my alley.
Loves animals? Ouch. Must love animals, Rose.
I cannot believe how in love I am with this man.
One night stand?
Marrying a midget was a cheap thrill?
I have a friend you might like to meet.
And I think I'm going to.
I like you so much, with or without hair.  But don't spread that around. Bad for business.
You've got to respect that.
What's the larger experiment?
The truth is most people don't have table manners today. And when the foundations of civilized society crumble and disappear, civilized society in its entirely follows closely at its heels.
I'm not sure.
I'm sorry?
It's only that I really enjoy your company and...
You do?
Yes, and...
Yeah  But I have some peculiarities also.
I think I'll get Johannsen in chemistry on that.  Oh! Did you bring the first aid kit?
You'll catch cold. It's cold.  What do you suppose he is, a survivalist?
Feral? Don't touch him! He might be diseased! He might... My God, rabies!
I think we should go. Please. Before he wakes up and, I don't know, eats us, or whatever feral things do.
Actually, I just had an amusing thought.
All right.
So, how's it going today?
Do you like my new look?
Shh. It's okay.  It's okay, Lila. You're what I want. You know that. You're exactly what I want.
Yes! And I want to help. You won't have to pay me, and I was thinking of giving up that crazy nature writing anyway.
I think he's ready.
Should I come with?
Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying his new digs.
Shut up! Yeah, this is Lila, cunt. And don't let the hirsutism fool you. I know more about being a woman, and more about the black hearts of men than you, in your pretty little powdered, bullshit fantasy world, can ever imagine. I know the darkness and cruelty of nature, sweetie pie.
Yahoo!
Did I? I tried so hard! I really concentrated! Oh, I'm so happy!
Puff, why don't you say a few words to the assemblage.
Unn.
Ounpoo. Ungh.
Unka unka unka unka unka.
Yes?
I'm in the book, if you ever want to drop me a line or something.
No, I'm fine.
I've never been to Louisville.
I'm ready.
It's all right, Eddie. I'm sure Mr. Gordon meant no offense. It was a figure of speech.
That's right, Miss Packard.
For whom and for what?
No, there's no tomorrow. Not with you. You own all the tomorrows because you buy them today, and you buy cheap.
I'm sure Mr. Felson knows what he's doing. Certainly you can afford a hundred dollars to find out.
Oh, about five hundred.
Do you really think you can beat him?
Bourbon. J. T. S. Brown.
Thought you only drank milk.
Only when I work.
Pool.
A thousand.
First time in ten years I ever saw Minnesota Fats hooked, really hooked. But you let him off.
Sure, you got drunk. That's the best excuse in the world for losing. No trouble losing when you got a good excuse. And winning! That can be heavy on your back too. Like a monkey. You drop that load too when you got an excuse. All you gotta do is learn to feel sorry for yourself. It's one of the best indoor sports: feeling sorry for yourself -- a sport enjoyed by all, especially the born losers.
Why back me then? Why not back yourself? Go find yourself a big fat poker game and get rich. You know all the angles.
Sign up.
Sarah Packard... Bert Gordon.
Here, I got it.
When do I raise the bet?
Please don't get off me now.
And just how do you figure that, Bert? What do you figure I owe you?
No. Hell, no! You Eddie Felson?
Look, friend, I'm not trying to hustle. I don't never hustle people that walk into poolrooms with leather satchels. Don't try to hustle me.
The expensive kind.
Come up here to play straight pool with Minnesota Fats?
Yeah, that's right.
It's gonna cost ya money. It always does.
I couldn't, huh? Okay. Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before.
How much we got?
Preacher, go on down and get me some breakfast, will ya? Egg sandwich and a cup of coffee. You want something, Charlie?
Get with what?
What are ya, chicken, Charlie?
Well, maybe that's it. I'm chicken.
Charlie, boy, you better give me that money. C'mon now, give it to me. It's mine.
With what?
C'mon, c'mon, just give me the money.
Yeah, to play Fats again.
You still don't see it, do you, Charlie? You are nothing but a small- time Charlie. You'd love to keep me hustling for you, huh? Wouldn't ya? I mean, a couple more years with me, scuffling around them little towns and those back alleys. You might make yourself enough to get a little poolroom back in Oakland. Six tables and a handbook on the side. Is that when you say goodbye to me, Charlie?
Yeah, that's what I think.
What time?
Ah, that's unfortunate, Mr. Felson.
Yeah. You must come again.
Now, look, fella, I saw you playing at Ames the other night.
What's the limit?
You're a pretty good player.
How much are you ahead?
Okay, friend. You're on.
Just a cup of black coffee, please...  Hey, ma'am! Wait a minute!  Would you, uh, like another cup?
I'm a college girl. Two days a week, Tuesdays and Thursdays, I go to college.
Hey!
When you've got money, you'll pay.
A loser?
He's a gambler.
Is he a winner?
Is that what makes a winner?
Sherry.  Very old, very dry.
Oh, I don't know.
More like a week. Look, I'll be back.
What do you want me to do? Just sit here and wait? Faithful little Sarah. Pull the shades down and sit. When you feel like coming back, you'll come back. And you'll love me. And then you'll go away again. Is that your idea of love?
He went off someplace.
If you don't mind I think I'll stay at the hotel.
Now and then. You know how it is.
Yeah. That's right, too.
And them fingers, them chubby fingers. And that stroke. It's like he's, uh, like he's playing a violin or something.
You miss?  Well, you don't leave much when you miss, do you, fat man?
Fats, I got about two hundred dollars here.
I came to play pool, Fats.
How much do you remember?
Was this -- "beautiful?"  Before?
Why don't you start with me?
I don't know.
That's who you are too, Emma.
You want me to stay?
He wanted me to see -- he thinks I was -- infected by you.
Yeah, but when your mother came what's the first thing you showed her?
Bathroom?
I'll have to go to a new school -- again.
It's got a name.  Copper Ridge. There used to be a copper mine near here.
... and Rigel.
What did it look like?
Are you sure you saw that?  In the rain -- it may have <u>looked</u> like it changed shape --
I had an awful dream.
I have to go over to the town this morning and do a lot of shopping. This house needs just <u>everything</u>. I'll probably be gone all day. Jimmy, hurry up and eat or you'll be late.
I left it at work.
I'm home now.
You know, it really is beautiful up there.  Let me show you.  We'll take a walk after dinner.
What's wrong, Ellen?
I'm not particularly interested, <u>Ms.</u> Magnuson, in what you think is correct. My wife and I are going away on a business trip this afternoon and we want Jimmy with us.  Keep him in your office until we arrive.
This is a new town for you.  Do you like it here?
No one comes here after dark.
Don't go in.
It's all this moving from place to place.  We're never settled.  I'm having nightmares myself.
What's the story on Jimmy Gardner?
Why, yes.
Just my luck, no ice.
We're losing them.
Did you try to switch to transponder channels?
David, I've been meaning to talk with you. It's nice you've been spending so much time with me, but...
Three years.
The television said they've started with the looting already. Vultures.
You think an important person like Constance is going to be listed?
Spunky?
We've gotta burn the rain forest, Pops. Dump toxic waste, pollute the air, rip up the ozone. Maybe if we screw this planet up enough they won't want it anymore.
Pops, you're a genius!
I'll see how they're doing with the radio transmitter.
I have a confession to make. I'm not real big on flying.
Get us out of here!
What're you doing?
We're loose!
But Mr. President...
Any news on my wife?
How're we doing?
Get on the horn with Atlantic Command. Let's upgrade the situation to DEFCON 3.
That's impossible...
With their shields down it might be possible.
Well, er... it's slowing down.
Dick-weed!
Dick-weed.
So, what do you do for a living?
I don't need it.
It's the wrong field, you idiot! Lucas' farm is on the other side of town.
They let you out?
How' he doing?
What the hell's going on?
Here... now.
My reputation precedes me.
Do you believe the Grail actually exists?
Call Donovan, Marcus. Tell him I'll take that ticket to Venice now.
Yes. Uh, how will we recognize this Doctor Schneider when we see him?
What?
The Word of God...
I maintain an apartment in Venice, at your disposal.
Dear me, the man is dense. This is a castle, isn't it? There are tapestries?
What good is it? This Grail Tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons. Pretty vague. Where do you start looking? Maybe if the Tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on. But the entire top portion is missing.
This is the manuscript in which the friar chronicled the Knight's story... it doesn't reveal on location of the Grail, I'm afraid... but the Knight promised that two "markers" that had been left behind would.  This Tablet is one of those "markers." It proves the Knight's story is true. But as you pointed out -- it's incomplete.  Now, the second "marker" is entombed with the Knight's dead brother. Our project leader believes that tomb to be located within the city of Venice, Italy.  As you can now see, Doctor Jones, we're about to complete a great quest that began almost two thousand years ago. We're only one step away.
You could be more right than you know.
Doctor Jones?
Pagan symbols. Fourth or Fifth Century.
Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades.
Are you sure?
Wouldn't it be wonderful if he were here now to see this?
Don't wander off.
No?
Is that what you think of me? I believe in the Grail, not the Swastika.
Elsa! Elsa, don't move!
Then wait -- count to twenty.
No, Dad. You listen to me --
Found it.
Rats?
Will you take it easy!
I came here to save you.
You said he had two days' start. That he would blend in. Disappear!
What am I looking for?
The floor's on fire! See?!
Dad!
Brody's this way.
There is more in the Diary than just the map.
What did you get?
I don't know. The first available flight out of Germany.
When we're airborne, with Germany behind us, then I'll share that sentiment.
Hmmm... What did we talk about?
Did I ever tell you to eat up? Go to bed? Wash your ears? Do your homework? No. I respected your privacy and I taught you self-reliance.
You left just when you were becoming interesting.
You call this archaeology?
The penitent man is humble before God.
What happened to Marcus, Sallah?
My father was looking for the Holy Grail. Did you kill him too?
Where is he? Talk -- or you're dead. Damn it, tell me! Tell me!
Then we'll die.
Who are you?
I didn't come for the Cup of Christ. I came to find my father.
Thank God all that mumbo jumbo rubbish is disappearing.
Rather bizarre menu, wouldn't you say?
The plane crash and your journey here sound -- most incredible.
His Highness has not yet taken a wife.
Dr. Jones, we are all vulnerable to vicious rumors. I seem to remember that in Honduras you were accused of being a grave robber rather than a scientist.
Lao She.
What you look at, Indy?
You don't like him do you?
No.
What does it mean, Indy?
Let up on the brake!
The evil starts in Pankot. Then like monsoon, it moves darkness over all country.
Dream -- nightmare is more like it.
Don't worry, I'm coming in! What is it?
Uh, listen -- Willie -- I got a better idea.
Can you move your arm?
I'd like to find one of those myself.
Is that what you're hoping to find at this palace, Dr. Jones?
He's afraid of something.
You're nice. Listen, I'm taking applications -- how'd you like to be my palace slave?
There's bugs! Bugs all over! Help! Help me!
Oh God, it's soft -- it's moving!
Wait -- what're you doing?
I'm not leaving without those stones.
It's okay. You're all right now.
They don't cry about you. They cry about the elephants leaving.
Don't do that.
It wasn't him.
Yes?
Kind of an oversight, wouldn't you say.
Who are you?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Why he's argumentative?
Anyone there?
Behind us?
I don't know anything. I just want to go home.
You gotta help.
Think of the scientific data we'll gain. Come on, lets get out of here.
Door's locked.
Oh my God...What did he look like, the man?
What do you mean?
They think we're safe here. They don't really need us. They're probably long gone.
You need ID in there?
Wait a minute. The fight. Where did he get you?
What do we do?
It's illegal.
...and a license to kill...
What's wrong with how I carry myself.
The beach?
Eat it.
What was?
Which language?
.
What happened?
Where are you going?
I'm not some hot shot test pilot. I'm not some playboy. I don't usually pick up girls.
What is it?
What did that cost?
Follow that busboy.
The blond...GRUNER. A killer.
My coast is Maine, actually. We have a place in Bar Harbor...And a bar in Sutton Place.
How do you know?
It's embarrassing.
I don't know!
And on my time.
No. What will you do.
We are trying to stand out. Right near his address. Easier to get them to come to us, than to try and find them. ..now keep your eyes open, something might present itself.
Sapporo..
Ow!
Door to the right. Get up and run.
I need a guide and you need a client...and $1000.
I don't trust her.
Do it.
Are you alright?
Now, you're too suspicious.
Not really. Truth is...I was ..jealous. Of you.
Don't worry, I owe you a lot. I'm not gonna let us rot here. I'm gonna find us a way out.
Not that truth!
Sorry...
We've ruined his market in Japan.. Where's Dieter?
Let us get to the border!
What happened?
You have nothing...
Well, I'm glad to see you. Sorry things broke up like that.
He's not an ordinary man.
You may not remember things.
Now, Joe, you know it was all a mistake, don't you?
Not you. Them.
The poet...something he said...
I'll be right there.
...right here too.
...and sort of...disinterest.
How often they come here?
Did he put you up to it? Did he ask you to sleep with me?
You're leaving.
Why?
I'm just on vacation.
You don't believe me.
They'd never talk in front of me. They'd walk away up the beach. Nervous about something.
How?
That must be him. Water taxi.
If Gruner led us away, Who'd he lead us away from?
Hong Kong.
I asked him.
I can't fly it.
They asked about you.
How?
Now what?
It wasn't me. It was him.
A drink...
Why?
It's alright.
I'll take some.
Alright, we'll do that tomorrow.
How long?
Sure. Where?
Well, it's authoritative and is overwhelmingly documented.
I want you to get legal onto CORPORATE CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS. Boundaries of their constraint. Kentucky state law about. I want you to drop everything.
Get me Wigand.
Oh, no, of course they're not influenced by money. They work for free. And you are a Volunteer Executive Producer.
What the hell are you doing?
So, what happened to Ms. Caperelli's checking with outside counsel first, all that crap?
And what are you implying?
You think I put that bullet in the mailbox myself...?
That bullet was for a .38 caliber. Do you own a .38?
Mike... Mike... Mike...
What does that mean? "Rife with -- ?"
How are you, Jim?
How prominent? What kind of placement?
Lowell?
Is there any more rice...?
That's my stuff from the office...
...it's anonymous. References to "P.M."  It's got to be Philip Morris, huh?
They're killing the Wigand interview...
Is it too late?
Well, would you want him to call you? Or, you want to call him? How do you want to do it?
Yeah.
It went great in Mississippi, Mike.
Oh, please, Mike...
No, you give me a break! I never left a source hung out to dry, ever. Abandoned. Not 'til right fucking now! When I came on this job, I came with my word intact. I'm gonna leave with my word intact. Fuck the rules of the game! Hell, you're supposed to know me, Mike. What the hell did you expect? You expect me to lie down? Back off? What, get over it?
In the real world, when you get to where I am, there are other considerations...
That Canada story? Still interest you?
I know what I have to know.
Should I just take the documents now?
How the hell do I know about Brown & Williamson?
It happened after I talked to you. I do not like coincidences!
Talk to me outside the zone of your agreement?
Johnson & Johnson. Union Carbide in Japan. I was general manager and director of new products. I speak Japanese. I was a director of corporate development at Pfizer. All health-related.  What else? Outside the "zone"...?
It was on C-SPAN. Yeah.
Okay, so, here you are... you go to work for tobacco.  You come from corporate cultures where research, really, creative thinking, these are core values. You go to tobacco... Tobacco is a sales culture. Market and sell enormous volume. Go to a lot of golf tournaments. The hell with everything else.  What are you doing? Why are you working for "tobacco" in the first place?
Next to your father?
I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I? I could be anything. Right? Anything worth putting on between commercials...
Maybe that's just what you've been telling yourself all these years to justify having a good job? Having status? And maybe for the audience, it's just voyeurism? Something to do on a Sunday night. And maybe it won't change a fucking thing. And people like myself and my family are left hung out to dry. Used up! Broke, alone!
Good. But Jeff...
...I was young. I was young... confused... We didn't handle it the right way...
Some public relations guy got a hold of a tape of an interview... where you're saying you were on the American Judo Team in the Olympics...?
What?
In other words, you were charging Sandefur and Brown & Williamson with ignoring health considerations consciously...
Object to the form!
Mr. Scruggs, Jeff Wigand. Lowell Bergman said I should give you a call...
Well, actually, all whores worship the dollar, if you want to get technical.
Objection, your honor!
She got absolutely nothing. Zero. Zip.
So. I won't be seeing her? Your clients usually visit me after the settlement.
No frown lines.  New watch?
You were going to be a Cardiac Surgeon. I was going to clerk for the Supreme Court.
Marylin Rexroth. She came into my office and signed a pre-nup with Howard Doyle.
What?
No.
It was like that scene in The Godfather. Frankie Pentangeli is called to testify against the Family. And he's in court, and he looks into the spectators gallery, and sees his Brother. They brought the brother from Sicily. And Frankie can't say a word. He can't testify. That's what it was like seeing Pat in there. I couldn't even have Ruth cross examine her.
You're vulnerable.
These are yours.
Did you see the tape?
Have you ever been married, Miles?
You just haven't met the right person.
All right, Miles. Let me tell you everything you THINK you know. I was married to Rex for a long time. I was an excellent wife, a partner, a lover, a hostess and a friend. There was only one thing I did wrong during the five years we were together. I got five years older. Think he should be able to ditch me for that?
See the tape. Then we can discuss reconciliation. Rex screwed up and I nailed his ass. Now I'm going to have it mounted and have my girlfriends over to throw darts at it. Then I'm getting on with my life. That's all I'm after.
-- we are both sure that's what we want?
Marylin? Forgive me but are you -- drunk?
Yes. I just got that, actually. It was a gift.
No... That wasn't right. I want YOU to be MY wife.
Did you just propose to me?
Do you want me to sleep on it?
Do you want to sleep on it?
Good.  Are those foods?
May I come in?
STUFF.  Got a light?
Those are gifts.
I know. So am I, right? And so is Agent Wilson of the Internal Revenue Service. He's a dedicated, underpaid graduate of Southwestern University -- very tenacious, and never more so than when he's dealing with an unscrupulous colleague.  I think it's only fair to warn you: I'm going to file an action, Miles. And after a decent interval I plan to have Ruth seek an injunction that will forbid your approach within 500 feet of my house.
Meaning my house.
Just listen to me. I'm sorry, Miles. It's true that my initial intention was to...
It's not something I wanted either.
You're forgetting Howard Doyle?
Pre-Castro.
We are. And it's winding down.
Are you forgetting about the Atcheson, Topeka and the Santa Fe?
Rex. Go away. I don't want to have to sic the dogs on you.
Have you been taking your digestive enzymes?
Is this a lover?
He never even asked. He just assumed --
I didn't know Barry had a beach house.
Of Massey Myerson?
Every week --
Soon, you'll have your own rage!
So, Ruth. How's Sam?
So, Miles. If you have a proposal, let's hear it.
Oh brother. Here we go.
...arty farty!
Don't threaten me, Miles. I did nothing illegal.
Mr. Rexroth.
...Well, my wife has me between a rock and a hard place.
When I first met Marylin -- Well, we were crazy about each other. Not emotionally, of course. We just couldn't keep our hands off each other.
I know that sounds rough but I'm about to close on a deal to develop some mini-malls, and I'm mortgaged up to my ass. If this deal goes south, I'm ruined -- I'll lose millions.
She always looked out for me.
Nothing.
Sometimes I have serious doubts about you.
Am I mentoring the wrong mentee?
Berry spoons.
HA!
I'd stay away from her, Miles.
You were never invited to meet your son-in-law?
What's the matter? Anything wrong?
Mr. Warne?
That's typical of your daughter. Takes those things for granted.  Why does she think I lugged her all the way from Miamiâ€  for the love of it?
Please understand me. When I say she didn't tell me anything about it, I mean not until a little while ago. She thinks you're entitled to anything you can get.
All I want is thirty-nine sixty. If you'll give me a check I'll get out of this place. It gives me the jitters.
You're a peculiar chap.
That's an evasion.
I might.
Your whole life is devoted to just one thing. To accumulate more money. At least there's romance in what he's doing.
A time will come when you'll thank me for this.
I won't thank you! I'll never thank you!
Landing on the lawn in an autogyro.
If you have, it isn't too late. You know how I feel about him. But I want to make you happy. You gave me such a scareâ€”Iâ€”when I couldn't find you.  You know, the old pump isn't what it used to be.
No.
No, I'll go through with it.
But that's silly, child. Seeing how you feel, whyâ€
You haven't heard from him, have you, Dad?
Looks like that was his only interest in me. The reward.
I suppose so.
If you really mean it, I will.
It's not quite that simple.  I've dealt with prisoners in my time, but this oneâ€
Try. Do me a favor. Try. It's your only chance. And hers, too. Do that for meâ€”and maybe we'll be friendsâ€  Maybe.  Do we understand each other?
No, thanks. We're not hungry.
Okay! Okay! Keep your shirt on, young feller. 
What do you think you're doing!
It's okay with me. I'm not arguing.
Now, that's a brilliant answer. Why didn't I think of it? Our conversation could have been over long ago.
Oh, yeah?
Now, listen. I'm in a very ugly mood. I put up a stiff battle for that seat. So if it's just the same to youâ€  scram.
Are you talking to me?
Remember me? I'm the fellow you slept on last night.
My ticket?
You're not going to notify my father, are you?
What for?
Hey, Bratâ€!  The VIEW moves to the rear door of the bus. Ellie stands on the bottom step.
Oh, I forgot to tell you. I registered as Mr. and Mrs. 
I kind of half expected you to thank me.
Your ego is colossal.
That, I suppose, makes everythingâ€”uhâ€”quite all right.
You've got a name, haven't you?
Yeah. I got a name. Peter Warne.
I can't go out like this.
Like what?
Like this. I have no robe.
I know a couple of truck drivers I'd like to have you meet sometime.  Come on, sit down.
Egg. One eggâ€”doughnutsâ€”black coffee. That's your ration till lunch. Any complaints?
Yes, you do. You think I'm a fool and a spoiled brat. Perhaps I am, although I don't see how I can be. People who are spoiled are accustomed to having their own way. I never have. On the contrary, I've always been told what to do and how to do it and where and with whom. Would you believe it? This is the first time I've ever been alone with a man!
Santa Claus?
Kingâ€”King Westley was in it.
Of course you shouldn't. You don't know how to do it. Dunking's an art. Don't let it soak so long. A dip and plop, into your mouth. If you let it soak so long, it'll get soft and fall off. It's all a matter of timing. I ought to write a book about it.
Well, you don't have to lose your temper!
Well, you were!
Oh, you are! Who made you the manager?
What's the matter?
First town we hit in the morning, you better wire your father.
Must be some strange power Westley has over you women.  How do you expect to get there?
And he carried you like this, I suppose.
That's silly.
And rich people have none of those qualifications, I suppose.
I wasn't gone more than a minute. Just went out to find you something to eat.
wasâ€”butâ€
What'd you say we're supposed to be doing?
Yes. But look at all the fun you had.  Mind if I try?
I proved once and for all that the limb is mightier than the thumb.
Oh, you've been hurt! There's a cut onâ€
Any luck?
What about money?
Talked him out of it. He thinks we're going to stay a week. I'll have to think of something before morning.
I hope you got your money.
Here's your ticket, ma'am.
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.  Here.
In about fifteen minutes.
Isn't he here?
You made no mistake sitting next to me.  Just between us, the kinda muggs you meet on a hop like this ain't nothing to write home to the wife about. You gotta be awful careful who you hit up with, is what I always say, and you can't be too particular, neither. Once when I was comin' through North Carolina, I got to gabbin' with a good-lookin' mama. One of those young ones, you know, and plenty classy, too. Kinda struck my fancy. You know how it is. Well, sir, you could'a knocked me over with a Mack truck. I was just warming up when she's yanked offa the bus. Who do you think she was? Huh? Might as well give up. The girl bandit! The one the papers been writin' about.  Yessir, you coulda knocked me over with a Mack truck.  What's the matter, sister? You ain't sayin' much.
Sorryâ€”I didn't mean toâ€
I've been thinking about you.
Yeah!
Okay, Joe. Listenâ€”you know I've always liked you. Anytime I could do you a great turnâ€”anytime I ran into a story that looked goodâ€”I always came running to you, didn't I? Well, I got one now. Those wires I sent you were on the level. It's the biggest scoop of the year. I'm giving it to you, Joe.
Well, I got it, Joe.
Sure. I wouldn't blame you, either.
Thanks, Pal. You saved my life.
Better start gettin' into your clothes.
Yeahâ€”wouldn't it?
Cause I'm a guy that don't believe in hoggin' it, see?  A bird that figures that way winds up behind the eight ball,[10] is what I always say.
What's on your mind?
I can use a smart guy like you.
Orange, New Jersey.
Yeah. Just babies.
I don't care if he was doing it with giraffes in the zoo, Numa, it's none of our business.  Let's keep this side of it quiet, shall we?
Now that's pretty important, Dean. You also told the FBI when you met him, he was six foot two.  Then you tell the Commission he was five foot eight.  How the hell did the man shrink like that, Dean?
Yeah, she was pretty, all right, but not half as cute as you, Deano.  You shoulda tried a legitimate line of business.
Street cats?
Chief, maybe you had a little too much to drink.
I'm just an investigator, Bill.  I leave the theories to you lawyers.
Keep saying what?
Who is he, Joe?  I've been to every bar, no one wants to talk.
I told your uncle I never met a lawman who wasn't a punk.  You too, Bill, even if you're family.  He's a big shot businessman.  I seen him on the TV news a lot with all the other big shots.  A fag, you know.  Goes by another name down here.
Yeah, what's the big mystery? Everybody down here knows the guy.
Lord, wake me, please.  I must be dreaming.
And the six of us, with almost no budget and in secret, are going to solve the case that the Warren Commission with dozens of support staff and millions of dollars couldn't solve.  We can't keep up with the crimes in the Parish as it is, Chief.
Those bastards!  That's proof enough right there of what we're up against. The whole goddamn Federal Government, Bill!
All right, all right.  Break it up.
If I'm so far from the truth, why is the FBI bugging our offices?  Why are our witnesses being bought off and murdered?  Why are Federal agencies blocking our extraditions and subpoenas when we were never blocked before?
I see... and why are you experiencing this paranoia?
...did you ever use the alias Clay Bertrand?
It leads farther than that.
Listen, Dave, why don't we order some room service, have a bite, relax. I'll stay as long as you want.
Colonel Finck, are you saying someone told you not to dissect the neck?
No, because there were others.  There were admirals.
Daddy said it was all right if I was real quiet.
That doesn't make sense, Mrs. Hill. We have the man that killed the President.
No.  I had guns all my life.  I used to go turtle shooting.
These new people never identified themselves.  They musta been watching the whole thing 'cause they knew everything Mary and me had been doing that day.  I guess I wasn't too hard to find - wearing that red raincoat.
...which is strange 'cause this is less than 20 minutes after the assassination.
The Oswalds are introduced by George de Mohrenschildt to Janet and Bill Williams.  It's through Janet Williams in October '63 that Lee gets the warehouse job, right smack on Elm Street at the Book Depository, which is owned by another oilman with ties to defense and military intelligence.
Not at all.  But on the other hand, I do have a lovely Chippendale dining table and I often have a friend over sitting at one end while I sit at the other.  That is precisely the point of a long dining table.  The splendor of the meal adds to the enjoyment of it.
No.  I'm sure I've never met anyone of such a bizarre appearance.
Clay Bertrand?  Clay Bertrand?  I believe there was a man with a name similar to that who worked at the Chamber of Commerce.  Is that the man you had in mind?
We waited for you... hours, Jim. You could have telephoned, for God's sake.  It's Easter!  You promised, Jim.
Did they live?
What?
I promise I'll make more time for Jasper.
That's not why I'm attacking him! You don't believe me - all this time you never believed me.
Huh?
Willie, are you willing to repeat your statements under sodium pentothal?  Under the supervision of a doctor?
What's wrong, Lou?
One little guy with a cheap rifle - look what he can do.
We need to find more witnesses, Lou.
Can we find her?
I never could figure out why this guy orders a traceable weapon to that post office box when you can go into any store in Texas, give a phony name and walk out with a cheap rifle which can never be traced.
Mobbed up all the way.  Tight with the Dallas cops.  I'm digging, chief. I just need 10 more men and some more dollars.
I took it once for a low thyroid condition...  It raises the metabolism, Lou.  Did David Ferrie strike you as the kind of person who had a low metabolism?
That means we gotta subpoena Time- Life on it.
Who?
I will not have any damned ultimatums put to me, Lou.  I'll accept your resignation.
I'm glad you came.  I'm sorry about the precautions.
I haven't yet.  I don't have much of a case.
Well, thanks for coming.
How much more?
Was he there often?
Yeah, he was there, too... sometimes he'd be meeting with Banister with the door shut.  Other times he'd be shooting the bull with Ferrie.  But he was there all right.
I don't think so, Al.  You remember the Hemingway story, "The Old Man and the Sea"?  The old fisherman manages to catch this great fish - a fish so huge he has to tie it to the side of the boat to get it back in.  But by the time he reached shore, the fish had long since been picked apart by sharks and nothing was left but the skeleton.
I've done quite well in Denver, Mr. Garrison, but I have to admire someone like you - and I have the means to back up what I say.
Hello.  Is this Jim Garrison's daughter?
That sounds fun.
Do you walk home?
Well, the public attention it would attract.  And we have no place for you there to be safe, we're not law enforcement officials, and many things are at stake in this affair, Mr. Ruby.
Who was there for your ass?
If that's what they want to do, they're doin' it.
Look, I hate to be the kinda nigga, does a nigga a favor -- then BAM -- hits a nigga up for a favor in return. But I'm afraid I gotta be that kinda nigga.
Aaaaawww man, I wasn't plannin' on goin' no place. It's twelve o'clock, man. I'm home, I'm high --
Well, my ass has got a problem spending ten thousand dollars of my own goddam money to get ungrateful, peanuthead niggas outta jail, but I do it --
Well, if you owe me, git your ass in the trunk.
Does he have the marked bills on him?
I went to give him his refund, so he wouldn't have to come here.
How'd you know where he was?
Great, you're here.
Can I have a word with you?
You should know if you bring in anything over ten thousand you have to declare it. You forgot or what? You could get a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar fine, plus two years in prison. Now you want to talk to us about it, or you want to talk to Customs?
But now you're telling us now you do.
It's kind of a sports bar
'Cause I look like I just got outta jail, that's why. You droppin' me off at home, right? There's a place by me.
Ten pounds. I lose it and put it back on.
That's him. How do you know 'em?
I didn't?
No, you didn't. What branch?
I used to bring over ten thousand at a time. That's the legal limit, so I never brought more than that.
It's all in lock boxes in a Mexico bank. But he's got a problem. He's -- what do you call it when you got money, but don't have cash?
Yeah, if I cooperate.
I called in sick this morning. As far as the airline knows, I'm still available.
What?... What'd you do?
He had his doubts at first. But he's always trusted me an wants more than anything to believe he still can.
I'm asking how you feel. Does it bother you?
Catching a movie.
"American President"
Sandra Bullock. You know her?
He weren't bullshittin' either, 'cause later he was suspended and forced to retire.
What about you Max?
Yeah, that night I went to pick up a guy. I hear he's staying at this house, so I sneak in, wait for him to come home.
You know, a good cop won't let you know he knows you're fulla shit.
But you still have to show him the money at the airport.
Well, you know I'm not going to show him the whole amount. He'll see fifty thousand.
How does Winston find him if A.T.F. and all the local Police can't?
People talk to Winston. He's street, same as them, they trust him. They get busted, they know somebody who can bond them out. I thought I might drop in on him. He'll no doubt be surprised to see me.
Ray wants him.
What do you tell Nicolet?
What if he hears something he's not supposed to?
I know.
I thought you were tired of your business?
I'm just tired in general.
Who's side are you on?
Yes'm.
Thanks for waiting, Jackie. Now tell me, what can we do for you?
No shit. You know how he makes his money?
I imagine shit needs to be done.
It was her coke I got busted with. She knows everything, but she's not part of it, and she's pissed cause she's not part of it. Ordell wouldn't even let her stay at the meeting. She tried to talk me into ripping off Ordell.
I'm sure that was the idea.
What did you say?
We could, if I'm not in jail.
That's fifty thousand, huh? It doesn't look like that much.
What? To put one of these in my pocket?
You didn't. I would think with all this on your mind, you'd wait till after.
I went looking for you. I went straight to the bookstore, 'cause that's where you were last time, but you weren't there. How the hell else am I supposed to let anybody know what happened? You didn't tell me how to do that, did you? I knew I was under surveillance, so when I couldn't spot anybody, I started yelling.
I thought you were watching him.
How long you been with Ordell?
Mr. Walker's my buddy. Ask him about Ordell.
You think I'm kidding?
Dreaming.
I got some vodka in the freezer.
And what was your answer?
I just came here to talk.
You told em? You told em it's me?
Well, shit. That don't mean you gotta confirm it!
What the fuck's that got to do with it?
You don't have to. I told 'em you're real careful. You never pick up money yourself. You always send someone, and I never know who it is.
That's a good idea.
The next trip, when I come with all the money, it'll look like I hand it to the same one I did before...
The money's in a Broadway shopping bag. I get some food, and sit down here in the food court. Then your girl comes -- you got somebody yet?
Man, I don't like that part.
Right, the one Simone gives me. Simone and I'll make the switch at Robinson's/May. She knows what I look like?
Susanville.
Two months shy of four years.
What for?
Is it ready to go?
I was pretty much the same height now as I was then.
You lived in Japan, when?
Well, so far he is. But you have to admit he's not too bright.
He killed a man worked for him the other night.
No.
He went to meet that stewardess.
Let him and that stewardess get that money over here...
Goddam you. Gimme that bag,
Watch it, dipshit. You wanna rip the fuckin' bag?
This one's for the ignition...  ...but you gotta hit this thing to shut the alarm off and unlock the door.
I know you don't know. I said guess.
What did he do?
Yeah.
Sure.
She tryin' to work your ass against me, ain't she?
Melanie must be dyin' to see it.  Louis.
You shot her twice?
Where's the rest of it?
How long was she in there?
Maybe a minute. She came right out.
Louis, You tellin' me the truth?
Look, I swear to fucking god, she came out with that bag and I took it from her.
'fore I blow that bitch's brains out, I'll ask her.
You're right, that was Ordell. You have time, you think you could find out for me where he's staying?
Who's it for? A relative?
What's his full name?
Ordell Robbie. O-R-D-E-L-L. R-O-B-B- I-E. 1436 Florence Boulevard. Compton 90222.
Brown, Jackie Brown.
Beaumont worked for you.
That's what the police thought. I told them I'm unemployed, how could I have anybody work for me? Now I bail out Jackie, I'm liable to have the police on me again, huh? Wanting to know was she doing things for me, was she bringing me that money!
Just listen for a second. We got a forty-year-old, gainfully employed black woman, falsely accused --
She wants to give you your money. If she didn't, there'd be cops batter- ramming the door right now.
How the fuck did he find me?
All I did was walk out with it.
Have her bring the money here.
By herself. That big mandingo nigga Winston ain't there, is he?
I call your office, she better answer the phone.
I know where it is.
My money's in that office, right?
Yeah.
Hello.  Hey, Jackie...  No, Jackie, I didn't get your message.
Where do you want to go?
What do you want?
Something weird is going on here. What is it about us? Even in Nam it was always weird. Are we all crazy or something?
Stop!!!!
You know, you got a strange line here.
Now what?
The army. The army. What is it with you guys? We're not talking about a trip to the library here. This is the United States Government for God's sake. This is red tape coming out of your ass. You know what I mean?
Ah! I thought you were a mailman.
But the paper ...
I was absent the day they taught that in school. What did she say?
Who?
If it was any other brain but yours, I might agree. Relax, this is going to be strong.
The postal service. I'm a mailman.
And how is your wife? Sarah, no?
I'm with another woman now. We're both with the post office, Midtown, 34th Street branch.
Last I heard you were offered a posi- tion in the West somewhere. Tuscon was it?
Oh, that goes way back. They had a hiring freeze, one of those last min- ute things. Bad timing for me though. Middle of the war. The draft.  I'll tell you Prof, after Viet Nam ... I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was just too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
I've got a problem, Prof. More Augus- tine than Kierkegaard, if you know what I mean.  I need to know about ... demons.
Demons? I don't know what to tell you. It sounds like a spiritual mat- ter to me. The problem, Jacob, is that you have no context for it. You're a renegade Existentialist suf- fering demons a hundred years after Freud. How the hell am I supposed to make it fit?
What's your name?
Go to sleep.
Jacob, what can I do?
What the hell did you do, move all the furniture?
Gee, thanks a lot.
Eli. Why can't you remember their names?
They're weird names.
Well, personally, I never went for church names.
Yeah, but for what?
The best.
I must have been out of my head.
She looked good then.
When was the last time I said a word?
I wanna leave. Get me out of here.
How come? The army?
He didn't give me a chance.  Look, honey, don't get upset, but he's not taking your case.
I don't know. That's all he said. He wasn't very friendly. Oh, yeah. He said your buddies backed down. They chickened out, he said.
Who was that?
It's amazing, you know, that a drug could change things like that, destroy a life and then give it back. It's hard to believe that the world could be so hellish on day and like heaven the next.
This is one of my dreams, Jake. Ever since I was a little girl. I never thought it would happen.
You know goddamn well what I mean.
Jake, what is it?
I'm tired.
Oh yeah? What was happenin' there?
Stop it, Jez. Don't do that.
This isn't happening.
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
Never?
I can't move.
Push 'em back.
Where am I?
I'm awake?
Paul Gruneger!
Paul! You son-of-a-bitch, how the hell are you? I haven't seen you in what, five, six, years?
Let's get a couple drinks, okay?  Hey, take a look behind us. Do you think that car is followin' us?
Why not?
She said I haven't been the same since then. Since that night. There's still this big hole in my brain. It's so dark in there, Jake. And these creatures. It's like they're crawling out of my brain. What happened that night? Why won't they tell us?
I'm so sorry. Obviously you haven't ... Dr. Carlson died.
I have some ice from the machine.
Bring it in.
Pour it in.
That's nine to four, geek-boy.
I don't have all day, kid.
Remember, stay calm, use your thrusters. We'll be fine.
Can't shut em' down from here.
You see that?
Better let me.
The hull's imploding!
Thorgan, quit screwing around and come on!
How many?
Wait a minute...I need...
Where is everybody? What happened?
Give me a break! What happened?
Well, I'm not hanging out here with Ms. Showtunes.
Kkinsa, open the goddamn door!
Med-kit?
Rizzo?!
What's this?
You?
No I'm not okay! I don't know what the hell I'm doing!
I think I had some when I was eight.
Did you like it?
Now what?
Kaboom.
I'll help you in.
We've got a situation here! Just do as  you're told!
You're so bossy.
No...  That's the sound of the men working on the chain gang.
You killed him?
Almost done.
I missed you too.
Fat Lou, bring the ship to the following coordinates. Call Grendel, have them power up the labs, we're bringing in the find of the century!
Now wait a minute! I don't think you should open that door.
The power's back up!
Nanotechnology.
We need to do some tests...I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Jason! Can't you see? He did this.
Azrael can you repeat that?
Scientists. Very intellegent men.
Guys, he's right behind us!
Cut my hand. Hit by a vampire.
All right, Commissioner. But when we're on my ship, I am Master, Mate and Pilot. And I want him...  ...along for ballast.
Did you get him in the head?
Probably out in the back yard.
Oh, yeah.  How do I look? Older, huh?
Older, sillier.
Love ya.
It's three feet deep, Martin
How come you have to tell them that?
Nothing to worry about -- I'll survive this.
What'll I tell the kids?
I don't think you can appreciate the gut reaction people have to these things.
I can't work in a vacuum. Why don't you make Hendricks Chief? His family's been here since the Puritans -- half this island are his cousins.
Let's all get out of here, this place stinks.
Why?
There's a fantail launch out there that won't make it beyond the breakwater.
Half a flounder. Hmmm... a burlap bag... a paint can... aha!
Just as I thought. He drifted up here with the Gulf Stream, from southern waters.
What is all this stuff?
There is a kind of shark called a Great White Shark that every expert in the world agrees is a maneater.
I'm familiar with the fact that you are going to ignore this thing until it swims up and bites you on the ass! There are only two ways to solve this thing: you can kill it, or you can cut off its food supply...
Think she might've run out on you?
Some friends and me took a house.
I agree. If she's going to advertise, I wouldn't recommend out-of-town papers. Amity people could take care of this.
One more after this, then I'm going home.
Twenty years.
Do I set the goddam hook?
Yep.
Well... is everything all right?
What's that supposed to prove?
That's pilot whale, isn't it?
What do you see?
That's disgusting! This is the largest, meanest, most vicious shark ever landed off Amity Island, and a known maneater!
Your shorts are looking especially gold today.
Well! Nothing like experimenting.
But you copy my work every week.
We could get back together too.
Wait, let me take that.
Mine too.
Oh God yeah. But I was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs.
Where the hell have you been, Junebug?
What? My eyes are not lying!
Sorry. I was just getting something.
Oh. That's, uh, my room. Vanessa lets me have a room for all my old stuff.
It's beautiful. I've always liked Gibson better than Fender.
What do you play?
Oh.
Yeah.
When was this, like '96?
Why aren't you at work?
Oh.
You're kind of a sellout, aren't you? What would the Melvins say?
What is it?
You don't have to do that.
Oh yeah. It's Herschel Gordon Lewis. He's the ultimate master of horror.
God, pretentious much? I guess everyone should have a mysterious name like Juno, huh?
"Most Fruitful Yuki"? What is... Oh my god, she's a pregnant superhero!
I'm leaving Vanessa.
What?
Yeah, I guess... Is this my fault? Is Vanessa mad at you because of me?
Wicked pic in the Penny Saver, by the way. Super classy. Not like those other people with the fake woods in the background. Like I'm really going to fall for that, you know?
Well hi Vanessa! What brings you to the mall today?
Um... Juno, can I -- Can I touch it?
Juno? What's going on?
Hi. I'm here for the big show?
I thought you were the kind of girl who knew when to say when.
She's joking. Junebug has a wonderful sense of humor, which is just one of her many genetic gifts.
Dad, no!
Dad, it's not about that. I just need to know that it's possible for two people to stay happy together forever. Or at least for a few years.
Nah, it was a premeditated act. The sex, I mean, not getting pregnant.
Aha! You love him.
Oh yeah! "Desperately Seeking Spawn." They're right by the ads for like, iguanas and terriers and used fitness equipment. It's totally legit.
Hey, I'm a sacred vessel. All you've got in your belly is Taco Bell!
No way! She's pretty.
I don't have a choice. Keith's been grading me really hard lately.
Please do not refer to Mr. Conyers as "Keith," okay? My barf reflex is already heightened these days.
Katrina? Pfft, no way. He doesn't like Katrina. It must be a pity date.
Hello. Thank you for having me and my irresponsible child over to your home.
Why do people think yellow is gender- neutral? I don't know one man with a yellow bedroom.
Juno, what's the matter?
What did you do?
What?
Why don't we let Juno go home and we can discuss this later on, okay?
No.
...I said, I like your hair.
...Yeah.
Is it hard to learn?
...I wouldn't lie to you, Adele. . . I saw him kill that man.
I feel kind of like the wizard of oz, you know when she gets the red shoes.
Don't be long now, dinner's 'bout ready.
You just smile, let me do all the talking.
How many times you gonna tell me that?
Yeah but, what is it?
It's just a work in progress, kinda rough.
...Well I probably drunk more than my share, anyway... you go on an' have it.
You two been busy in here.
What did he sound like on the phone?
I still think we should have met them first.
Oh, yeah... He had a real thick accent right outta "Deliverance."  "Still? Who said anything about a still? Get ya ass up in them woods!"
What is it?
I can't believe I agreed to do this.
Any word from that gallery?
Darlin' you were 'bout that far from spendin' the night at the morgue. You understand?
You were plenty hot.
...You know what I mean?
...The police were way out of line when they stopped you from beating that bartender half to death. And no doubt God'll be pickin' on you on Judgement Day...
His Parole Officer.
...That'd be my guess.
Looks like somebody cut off his ring finger.
Yes. Altogether.
Were they wearing condoms?
I knew you fucked it! I sat out here for like two hours! That girl was like twelve, and you hit it up!
Did what take?
How?
That would be good. But I mean more like. I don't know. Like when I was having sex with her, I kept thinking how much I would like to put it in her ass. Just to see what would happen.
You think he's got any herb?
I don't know, he quit dealin' but I'll bet he'll smoke us out.
Probably.
I want to knock her guard down. I mean there's a whole philosophy behind it. Having a virgin suck your dick, that's basic because there's nothing lost.
You thirsty?
Three pennies and a ball of lint.
You know like in "The Wonder Twins" they share everything.
Yeah. "The Wonder Twins". You know.  Activate in the form of, a glass of water.
Yep.
Yeah. She's only 13.
I watched her eat the watermelon. And all this juice started running down her chin and onto her shirt.
Yeah.
Good luck?
How much you gonna take?
About ten. Fifteen is good.
Yo. I'm gonna get buff dude.
Nah.
Hurry up man. Let's be out. I wanna go swimmin'.
Nothen' B.
Na.
Ooh. You're gonna give me goose bumps.
At the block party?
You should come back with me to Steven's house.
No...
You know what I want to do?
Yeah.
Because I like you. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't even believe it.
I don't know. I just think that you would love it.
I don't feel so well. Have you seen Telly anywhere?
What?
No.
Your a real philosopher.
Right. You're like it's just this instinct. It's like this animal instinct is taking over you. It's like...
Passion...
Yep, yep. But he has to know what he's doing and where he's going. Because they can like touch you for hours and they won't ever know.
Yeah. And then it hits that little thing.  That little punch bag. What is it? The tonsils. The esophagus, whatever.
That's it. I'm gonna have to tell my little brother, I'm gonna die. I can't make him his lunches anymore.
Oh shit.
Yeah I get bored.
I've known the past of all the people I've fucked without a condom. Like I know one of the people got tested and was negative.
And I know that one of them fucked like two other girls, who were both virgins, so I knew he was safe.
You've heard the stories right?
Holy shit. That's all true?
No. I was just kidding.
But then I won't need your money.
Four-thirty in the morning?
Nothing. We just wanted to come by and see what you were up to.
Right.
Yeah. And it takes them either too long or too short to come. Have you ever had someone that took forever
It's like sweet and sour, and salty butter.
Shit. All right. But don't fuck with anything OK?
We seem to have a little problem here?
I think you're lying.  That's what kind of problem.
Casual?  You were boning her weren't you?
You got it on the board.
Then what's he talking about?
You sure you weren't over on Pine Road?
The message!  I figured out--
Local?
Take it easy.  Both of you.
You still having a problem with this?
What is it?
Now that you mention it there was somebody who looked suspicious.
It doesn't make sense because we don't understand it.
Remember eventually revenge is carefully...  Have you tired juxtaposing the words?
Oh, c'mon.  We're not going to spend any more time on this crap, are we?  It doesn't mean anything.  It's Sanderson!
Hello, Peter.
That's something you'll have to figure out for yourself.  Really, Peter, you can't expect me to answer such direct questions.
I'm sure there are other people who would be interested in what I have to say.
And you want these girls to feel your pain?
Please, I don't want to get into the psychological aspects of my actions. It would detract from the game.
Last night was very exciting, wasn't it?  Have you figured out what I'm doing?
I'm beginning to think it doesn't mean anything.  Remember eventually revenge- -
By that time the game will be over.
I've figured out the message.
Sure.  We've got a modem line hooked up with the data base in New York.
Can we correlate data?  Look for specific things, like player's ages... stuff like that?
It worked out alright, didn't it?
Why did he what?
You must be Erica.
Uh huh.
That's only because you don't know where to go.  You like hiking?  Fishing?  Sailing?  What do you like?
Not much.  There's no sign of a break in.  I think she let him in.
Any sign of rape?
There's no blood.  Where's the fuckin' blood?
No prints.
He tapes their mouths shut.  We found traces of adhesive around the victims mouths.  We're doing a chemical analysis for components, but it's probably a standard brand you can buy in any hardware store.
I'd say at least eighteen hours.
I'm a psychologist, Frank... not a psychic.  What's this all about anyway?
I'm busy right now.
Yes.  Why disguise your voice if no one knows it?
It can't be a coincidence.  The woman that owns it has a son.  She says he's been on vacation in Montana for the last ten days.  We're trying to locate him.  There's also a cleaning service that comes in once a week.  We're checking that out too.
As large as castles.
And what if he's wrong.  If you were one hundred percent sure it was Peter you would've arrested him.  If it is someone else then he's going to kill again tonight and you're sitting here ignoring the message.
No.  He was wearing a mask... but I saw the cut on his wrist.  It was Peter.
How can he be playing Chess with you? You're not making any moves against him.
It's a commercial area.  No one lives there.
A shadow.  What's as big a castle?  As light as air , but one hundred men can't move it?  The shadow of the castle.  Are there any buildings that have the name Castle in it that cast a shadow long enough to fall across another building?
You opened with the English.  Lutz won't use it.  He opened his first game with it.
On a variation, yes -- but it must be a variation that is unique.
About what?
She went into town with Mrs. Lutz.  Did they get him?
Hi, Sara.  This is Doctor Sheppard.  I was wondering if you could tell me if you have a book on chess called "Principals and Tactics" by Anton Berger.
Bainbridge Books.
What are they, please?
--but you enjoy being the stronger one? You like the control.
In a way.
That's true -- but the emotion is still there.  They just learn to control it.
That's not fair!
No.  But I'm open to distractions.
What is this?
Nobody could attack you.  You set your life up like one of your chessboards. You're impregnable -- but at the same time you've become trapped behind your own defenses.  You're cut off from everyone around you.
This frightens me -- because I'm starting to feel things I haven't felt in a long time.
Nothing.
For emphasis?
What?
I'm not looking for an apology, Peter.
I was thinking that... maybe when this is all over we could...
No, listen.  You have no idea of the kind of pressure I'm under right now.
This letter.  I've never opened it.
You're getting sloppy, Yurilivich. You're nervous?
Last night was the worst. I dreamt you had one leg shorter than the other, and walked like a penguin.
Well, you're beautiful.
I don't trust you to wash behind your ears.
I don't know how.
The White Castle has fallen.
Turold's son was to marry her.
Two or three days! While Lyssa is in their hands?
There is nothing.
She can't see out. She can't tell us where the Fortress is.
It is my fate to die in the Fortress.
I road them often in my youth.
What business?
Once is enough, thank you.
Try your tricks on me and I'll turn myself back into a snake and bite you.
Fame is what you leave to your sons.
Forgive me. It's childish to cry.
We must try to get horses.
These we'll pay for.
What kind of friend do you think I am?
A good thrust, my friend. Another second and there'd have been nothing between my head and shoulders but bad memories.
Nothing worse than lower-class boors with upper-class morals.
Me.  May I eat with you tonight?
Where are you going?
I'm hungry.
We meant only to please you.
Many villagers are hiding in the forest. They need food.
He was aiming a huge spear right at me!
And who is <u>he</u> that they should join <u>him</u>?
It has been taken, Freylag and all his people slaughtered.
I knew.
A match for your son, I think.
Modred! Impossible!
You know the voice.
The Dark Ones will appose you with all their power.
Memory is no trick, it is a power. The power to see.
Power you have given me. What can my power give you?
OK. Mister Stansfield, Norman STANSFIELD.
Well... Did you sleep with him or not?
...Not at all.
Yeah... Well... I don't know.. I don't know any.
Why can't I have a bank account?
Yeah, but I didn't get him, I got his case and now he's behind the tree. What can I do?
What?
...No...
...That's awful.  I hope you killed, that asshole?
You... You knock the code, when you come back, OK?
I don't know... Five minutes.
Mathilda, listen!
Huh?
Can I sit on the stairways now?
Rinaldi... Rinaldi...  What region do you come from?
Yes... Twice.
This smells good.
She was being symbolic.  What if she asked you to fly to the moon?
A wife?... Did someone piss drunk run into your wife?  Crushed her like a bug.  Snapped her bones?
What steps do we take now?
Yes -- you are.
You should start slow and easy -- fifteen minutes a day.
Have I forgotten something?  Is this a special day?
I want to be shown...  Maurice would you do anything for me?
There's no reason.
You like to take walks?
It's one of those thoughts you keep to yourself.
The beach of Pacifica, California.
Why?
Hansen's whipped.  Has to call his wife every two hours or she'll go ballistic when he gets home.
Michelle, breathe... that's it, what is it, talk to me.
This is a ghost town.  Nothing ever happens.
Ellen got up every morning and went to the corner store to get me my bread for breakfast... Everyday. Now that's about a quarter mile each way... 17 years... that comes to about three thousand miles...  And you know what Kris?
Tom Joad?
You're in pain.
I need your help.
They told me, you might try to talk me into something... You need to rest Mr. Parker... It's for your own good.  I've been following your story for a long while.  It's a beautiful thing you did.
You look so happy -- how long have you been married?
Hello.
Evening News?
This isn't right.
Coffee?
Water?
Hello!
Right, I'll get your door. I tend to fade in and out lately.
I guess I do too.
Maybe another drink first. More tequila?
I think about four weeks, and I've got enough for about two hundred and fifty to three hundred dollars a day.
If I was I'm sorry.
No, just drunk... but that's OK. Where's your car?
Yes.
I'm rambling. I really like you. You make me want to talk... I don't know what time it is.
Is that really what you want to ask me?
First. It's our first. I'm just concerned. So... why are you killing yourself?
Three nights, two days. When is your rent coming up at the motel?
There's no reason to blow all your money on a hotel room.
Seriously, Ben... I need to keep pretty low-key around here. Maybe next time you could nap this side of the door. That was the landlord.
How are you doing?
Can we just forget it?
Last spring I happened to walk past a house that I had once patronized. There was a cool breeze blowing off the ocean and through the window I could see a bare leg. The girl must have been taking a break between customers. It was a strange moment for me because it reminded me of my mother and despite the fact that I was late for something already I just stayed there, loving the atmosphere of it and my memory and... the reason I'm telling you this epilogue is that I felt that I'd come full circle.
You know I love you... yeah?
The news is not good, kid. This bit here... see there... it's broken. You need a new  one.
About ready for another drink?
A date. What, are you a hooker?  What do you mean a date?  I've got a wife back home. I just came over to talk for a few minutes.
You have been lonely?
Yes, but your major is Fashion Merchandising. Harvard won't be impressed that you aced "History of Lycra". What are your backups?
Enrique's gay. I'm sure of it.
Did she have a weapon in her hand?
Was there any reason for you to believe she had discarded a weapon?
Not that I saw. But like I said, I went straight upstairs to take a shower.
But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?
Did you hear a shot fired?
Where you got in the shower.
Yes?
You showed up Warner in class? You're supposed to be showing up Sarah.
God, that felt great!
Uh -- family.
Too bad you and I are the only ones.
I know. He has it sent out.
Did you know he got wait-listed when he applied? His father had to make a call.
Can someone please tell Rick that he is not the only Sigma Chi with a big penis?
Did she do that to you, too?
Why?
It would be a full-service law firm, by and for blondes, providing positive blonde role models and community outreach in high blonde areas. I mean, think about it -- name one blonde intellectual role model.
That is a direct result of anti- blonde discrimination!
Law school was a mistake. Getting this internship was a mistake.
Going back to LA. Maybe I can fulfill my destiny as a useless bimbo and join the Swedish Bikini Team. No more navy blue suits. No more panty- hose. No more trying to be something I'm not.
Then, forget it. Besides, I have an early class tomorrow.
Is he the only one?
But I'm not positive it's gonna happen tonight --
Thank you, Serena, but I don't think it'll do any good.
Girls -- I'm going to Harvard!
Oh, my God! I completely forgot to tell you!
I wish we could stay longer, but I have a game.
I don't know --
Class schedule, map, book list.
My family expects a lot from me. And I expect a lot from me. I plan on running for office some day.
Well, that's what we're trying to prove didn't happen. Do you have any reason to believe it did?
Why so few?
We come watch... we come watch...
We watch... good fun...
I speak of love, and you think only of the lash.
I like well what I see.  It pleases me.
You lie!  You wish to humiliate me, as if the form I'm forced to bear were not punishment enough!
God protect me.
I prefer to think, more like the sagacious owl.
And then?
What was that?  Did you hear that?
It's odd... when I first found myself... changing... I was sick with loathing and disgust.  I thought I was so ugly I wanted to die...
No need lie, boy.  I no hurt you. Do I look like I wanna hurt you?
Country fa' fa' away.  To the East, beyond the lising sun...
You got no idee.  People there lookee diffelent; speakee diffelent. Nothing the same.  In my countlee I bling good luck.  Makee lain and thunder.
No!  Tis not the time!  I want no part of your frolic.
No... I... I need to rest.
I meant no disrespect.
Twas the Princess Lili gave me the answer... have you seen her, by chance?
Someone worthy of respect, lad.  She be a water spirit, lives in a bog down at sea-side.  Hideous creature to look at, even by my doubtful standards; devours little children, she does, when she can catch them.
The princess is dead.
Have we turned grave-robber, then?
And who might that be?
Better pray the worm's a sound sleeper, Jack.
I'm small... and I can make myself smaller still... Small as a bee! Small as dust...!  Want to see me do it?
We march on Castle Couer de Noir within the hour.
Beware.
Aye.  He's enchanted the lot of them.  His reward for delivering the unicorn.
Nay, Jack, tis not what you're thinking.
Can we trust him?
There's more than one way to spring a trap.
What magic have we on our side?
He'll be atop the portculis ere long.
It doesn't matter.
Nay.  You've not reckoned with the powers of faerie medicine.
I don't... understand.
Aye.  Hurry now, Gump, the key!
What weapon?
Ride like wild fire, Jack.
Might not need a gesture quite so grand.  What were you doing the very moment the Baron's curse fell on the world?
We seek to undo the curse.
But you did... you did!
I may have said perhaps...
He'll not flee if I show myself?
They tricked you.
Oh, yes, and the mare with him.
Jack... Green Jack, you mustn't flatter me so.
Tis the truth.
Let it.  Haven't you a cozy bower we might hide in?
Be it fit for your wife, Green Jack?
Oh!  Green Jack!  What a dream I've had... proper nightmare.
Nay, dearest Jack... you are to be my husband.  I want none other.
Pinching?  Where?
Honored to make your acquaintance.
I bring you the only treasure worthy of your loveliness... for naught else in the universe rivals the reflected glory of your beauty.
Not very precise directions.
You... you... you mortal you!
Is this a May Day pageant?  Are you all off on a lark...?  The raven passed this way hours ago!
What's she doing?
Each fit for a hero... My uncle fashioned a hammer for Thor.  Twas he named it Mjolnir.  Grandfather forged Excalibur... You won't ever see finer craftsmanship.
Achilles wore it before the gates of Troy.
You're with us in battle.
A castle's but stone and mortar --
Are you going to see Sam again?
I woke up this morning at three and couldn't fall back asleep.  Everyday I think I see more of Sam than I've seen in years.
When does George get to come see his house?
Are you his friend?
Don't you have school?
Hey.
They're trying to make me spend the summer here.  I'm leaving in the morning.
Where to?
You should stay.
Really?
I wanted him to marry her.
I can use your mom's.
Why are you so uptight?
What's the point of this?
You're off, you know?  You're way, way off.
He asked where you were!  He wants you with him.
Well, he doesn't need to worry.
It's thirty feet.
What are you on?
How's your wife?
I'm not.
It may sound that way, but I react out of fear.  My life has nothing to do with what I like or don't like.  You haven't been listening, have you?
Oh, well...those are...I mean, we don't get to keep our work.  I could maybe ask them if you could choose one.  But, you know, frankly George, you were the best. Computer models can't begin to match the beauty you gave yours.  They're a part of this firm.  They inspire me.  I go out there and sometimes just stare at something I've designed.  It amazes me. I would miss that too much.  Look, I may be going out on a limb, but you go out there and look them over, every single one of them and pick the one you like the best and take it with you. Just run it by me first, just in case, you know...but I'm sure it'll be okay.
Well, it's the least I can do.
Thank you.
I did warn you.
I'm not going!
Are you totally insane?!
Probably in the bible.
What are you doing?!
You snore at night.  That bugs me.  Can I take you out?
It'll be fine.
I can promise you complete privacy.
I don't know.
Well, until you know, you can't go.
Where is it?
Do whatever you want with it.  I don't care.  All I want from you is for you to remember we built this house together.
Hi, Alyssa.
Getting high, I guess.
I was just thinking about my mom.  She wouldn't leave him.  I remember one time she made us dinner wearing sunglasses.  I mean it was dark outside and in.  But we never talked about it.
After everything.
I don't know what that means.  What kind of problem?
I aimed high.
Kurt's been feeding him.
How many years did I live with your beams and boards?  First in the garage, then in the living room.  We're going to do it, Robin.  Next year.  Next year.  Salvaged floorboards from a house in Pasadena. Doors from a church in New Hampshire...
Sounding?  I need help.  He's cheap labor.
Last time you were gone for a week!
What?
I was here six years.  And I only hated two.
Finished or unfinished?
Is your back still killing you?
Peter left me yesterday.
I could die.
You got any weed?
Don't even...I'm there.
Then you tell me, what just happened?
We've eaten.
Sam is working at something for the first time in his life.  Once in a while he even talks to me.  I want to be around for that.
Where are the kids?
I've missed you guys.
I guess I could teach you some things.
All day again?
Can't Get Right? That's the kid's name? Can I talk to him?
Crawford's are always looking for new talent.
She's alright, isn't she?
You know, go to the tonk or whatever.
Damn dentures slipping again. Everything falls apart when you grow old, eh, Claude? Time sure marches on.
You been on the farm for quite a spell, haven't you?
You know I trust you, Claude.
Sure, boss.
Engagement ring!
Come on, honey, let's get out of here.
Yeah, that side of the family has all the looks and none of the brains. I hope he don't mess things up.
Ray Gibson?  No, no. He's the reason I'm in here, Daisy. For all I know, he's got a record a mile long. I got a better shot of getting out of here on my own. You tell Maynard to think about me, concentrate on me. Understand?
Don't I know you?
You gave up baseball to be a bank teller? I can't latch on to that.
You're talking about giving up baseball to be a bank teller.
What are you talking about?
You lost all our money in a card game?
I think he's hurt pretty bad.
What ain't there?
Why do you think they call him Jangle Leg?
Pack of lies. Don't listen to him. We didn't kill nobody. We were railroaded. And we gonna prove that.
What does that mean?
Forget it.
We? Did I hear you say we? As I recall, you're the one who said there is no we. Guess we got some bad news in that letter, huh?
The hell you talking about? What train?
I don't know. Who do you want?
Him?
Judge must have money riding on the championship.
One of the new kids said they're farming those acres just north of the swamp. He said he saw a crop duster flying around the place.
You're a sucker. I'd have taken that deal.
I was sorry to hear about your mama passing.
Wilkins' driver's got the flu, so he asked me to fill in for him.
Damn, it was getting hot in there.
You didn't think I was gonna let you escape alone, did you?
Then you're lucky I came along. Doesn't take a visionary to spot a golden opportunity like this. Now help me out of this trunk.
You ain't getting out of that trunk.
Forget about that. You run if you want to, but you're not taking this car.
Don't shoot, sir. I can deal with this.  Ray, buddy, you don't want to shoot this white man. See, you do that, they'll kill you for sure. And it's not that I like you or anything, but I've kinda gotten used to having you around.
An erection, huh? Haven't had one of those in a while.
Well, Ruth shoulda built it a little better. Damn thing's falling to pieces. Gonna hurt somebody.
Why the hell not?
You didn't get ketchup?
Next thing, you're gonna be complaining about the seats.
You kidding? I've been in and out of prison my entire life. Mostly in. I'm hard-core.
Creamed chip beef on toast. Except we're outta beef, so I had to improvise.
Can't I get one of those steaks you got grilling back there?
Looks like we got a couple of live ones. How long these boys in for?
So Ray and Claude got their pardons, right?
I was already here a good many years when they came in in 1932.
What are you doing here, mama?
Don't cry, mama. This place ain't so bad as it looks. Sure, we work hard, but there's plenty fresh air and sunshine... And you know something else, I've taken to going to church regular. They got services every Sunday right there in the mess hall.
I'm just trying to pay the toll on the road to justice.
Jenny?
Hey, Ray, Goldmouth don't believe me. Ain't it so they got trains up in New York City that run under the streets?
Who?
Me? Willie Long.
If I was you, I'd want somebody who can handle himself in a tight spot.
You saying we go up there and kill everyone?
Hello, Cassius.
You know, New Hell really only needs one new Satan.
No!
Ta-da. So what time is my brother expected back?
And give you a good buzz.
I remember that night, you had like four daiquiris.
I gotta help her. I gotta help Dad. I gotta help everybody.
Oh my God, he just opened his mouth and swallowed that spit.
I seem to be in trouble, Beefy.
I didn't murder anybody
Look. You were really high. Things happen.
I was with Valerie, I swear. This is Adrian's work. I've got to find him.
I'm sorry. After careful consideration, I regretfully have to decline.
Don't worry about coming up with anything. It's cool.
Who is this, Metal-lick-a?
Uh, I'll do my best, Dad. Do you have any advice at all for me?
You're back in Hell now, kid. There's no butterflies here. If you want butterflies, you need to be on Earth.
You know, I was the one who created Hell.
Boogerland!
Your father wants to see you and your brothers in the throne room.
I've never been to Earth. I've never even slept over at some other dude's house!
Looking for the chief.
I followed him all the way downtown, and when he gets out of the car, I reach under my seat and pull out an aluminum bat.
Yes, great movie...
Hello.
Why are you laughing?
I don't know, but I like it. Say. Your glasses are nice. They make your eyes look sparkly and big. It's fun to look at them.
My dad's in hell, and he's falling apart.
You know what's nice about you? You just seem happy being yourself. You don't try to act cool.
Are you dead?
Well, that's because he's the Devil. And he wants to keep his throne for another ten-thousand years. Which is fine with me, but not with my brothers, so they broke out of Hell, causing my dad...
Where'd a sweet Southern boy learn to fight like that?
That just hurt a lot.
And if that is your so-called "flask," how would I have it unless I was, in fact, a thief?
All right -- what are you?
Never a pair. I have never had a pair.
How do you want us?
Did you ever see Francis-8?
Did you?
He's the one. You too. I remember. He was in a hurry. Just a face job. Dark hair, I said. Then he killed Doc and you grabbed me -- and the machine blew up and I ran... I ran.
No.
Sad? What made you sad?
He was killed.
You felt sad. What's your name?
I thought I had to do something.
Curious.
I couldn't get you out of my mind.
Maybe... sure...
You know.
You're not going, are you?
I'm only telling you what I've heard...  Haven't you ever wondered what your seed-mother was Like...?
I'm ashamed. I was bringing you to be killed.
Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is. But if I take you to them, they'll kill you.
Will he find us and kill us? Yes... or one of the others.  You know there's only one place to go now...
Will you take me with you?
You knew that I wasn't before, didn't you?  Why did you stay with me?
Maybe we're the first ones to get through...  Maybe Sanctuary is near, now... another protected place. It couldn't be outside.
He asked if we would bury him when his time comes.
And Sanctuary?
Beloved husband...
What's that?
Hello, Sandman.
I like your face. Would you mind if Doc took a picture? I'd like him to give your face to somebody else.
It's all right with me. Is he here?
Gracious... no.
My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?
Where are they?
Not yet.
Logan-5... Francis-7, authorized duty quadrant. Intrusion accidental.
Pete... You okay?
Do you always sleep here?... In this room?... Both of you?
No.
Me, too.
Me, too.
What deal?
What's he do?
'Cause that's how long it's gonna take, baby.
Dick Laurent?
Wonderful!!... Wonderful to see you, Pete. How are you?
Feeling good, Arnie. Ready to get to work.
Nice to know they can't seem to get along without ya.
Who is it?
A headache?
That's it.
Did you use the alarm system since we were here last?
The doctor said not to give you anything. You can see him in the morning.
We've met before, haven't we?
No, no I don't. Are you sure?
At your house.
That's why I married you.
I don't know... There's no return address on the envelope... In fact, there's no address on it.
When you didn't come to the club.
From the club. You didn't answer.
But...
I don't remember... Anyway, Andy's okay...
Because if anybody's givin' you trouble, Pete, I can take care of the problem... like that. 
Okay... Well, I'll see ya then.
Okay.
No. No, I don't.
You want some company?
I don't know.
I don't want to talk about it...
Oh, read it!
I have here a discovery that will startle the world. It's the vertebrae from the lumbar of a Megatherium,[4] found in Asia.
Something tells me this means food. Come on!
I'm thinking.
Okay, Lovey.
And this trip to the valley. I can't imagine why I'd allow you to drag me down here. Why, we don't know anything about these people. We're not even armed!
Hey, hurry up, you slow-pokes - I'm starved!
Cave, eh? Where?
By the way, what religion do you follow here?
When was all this?
Well, is it?
Forgive me. I should have told you it is quite common here to live to a very ripe old age. Climate, diet, mountain water, you might say. But we like to believe it is the absence of struggle in the way we live. In your countries, on the other hand, how often do you hear the expression, "He worried himself to death?" or, "This thing or that killed him?"
That's all very fine if it works out. A little amazing, of course.
Suppose she should leave it?
Sure, you can help me! You can help me jump over that cliff! I've been looking and looking at the bottom of that mountain, but I haven't got the nerve to jump!
Amazing, Mr. Chang. This place is amazing! And that marble quarry in the valley is simply magnificent. Oh, I've looked around. I've seen everything. Your woodworkers and your cloth-weavers - they all seem so very, very happy.
Yes.
But to be candid, Father, a prolonged future doesn't excite me. It would have to have a point. I've sometimes doubted whether life itself has any. And if that is so, then long life must be even more pointless. No, I'd need a much more definite reason for going on and on.
Mine?
You?
You'd better try to get some sleep, Bob.
Oh George, come on.
He's dead.
See that spot?
Well, we haven't been murdered in our beds yet, George, have we?
For heaven's sake, Bob, what's the matter with you? You went out there for the purpose ofâ€
Well, I - I really don't know what to say. Except that you must be completely mad.
What else can I think after a tale like that?  Good heavens, Bob, things like that don't happen today. We're living in the twentieth century.
I'd go mad!
So everyone is serenely happy in Shangri-La? Nobody would ever think of leaving?  It's all just so much rot! She's pleaded with me ever since I came here to take her away from this awful place. She's cried in my arms for hours, for fear I'd leave her behind. And what's more, she's made two trips to the plateau to bribe the porters - for me!
Yes, everything!
Good.
I guess we're in for it.
Yes.
Thank you.
Why?
You know, if you keep on asking that, we're not going to get anywhere. And don't ask me why.
How about you? Do you want to go?
Well - no - I think I'd better wait. Yes, yes. I will. I'll wait.
The hell happened?
Yes.  That's true.  Actually, at this point, I just want A job.  Wait. What do you mean... yet?
Only the damn guy won't know it.
Mikey.  Hold it, Mikey-- I want you to talk to me.  Mikey.  I'm telling you.. don't make me... Mikey   Gimme the 140.
Little more burn on the perimeter-they weren't roasting smores here. Dig out this hole a little.  Cmon, I know it's late, but the sooner we get it right, the sooner we'll all be home.
Kay, listen, I dunno what got into--
Listen-- do me a favor-- don't mention the 140 thing--
Dee, you've been useful for 50 years.  We're clueless, you're tired. Why don't you go home and get some rest.
Dee.  God damn it.  I told you to go home.
What?  Who the hell are you?
Vayanse. You others, go on.
We wear black.
I'm just saying it was cold.  I think she kind of liked me.
She didn't even know you. .
Just so I understand... you're "thing" is... acting like an idiot?  Or is it actually being an idiot?  Besides--
Uh... you mean... a family of sixeyed, red-faced space creatures travelling to New Mexico to have dinner with their cousins, the invertebrates?  Seemed pretty god damned ordinary to me.
Or someone has a nitrogenizer.
Why did Mikey leave Nazca?
What's going on, Kay?
Jesus Christ...
How does that help me?
I'm going to try and cut him off at the hotel.  You guys get to the Memorial.   Keep this stuff hidden.  The last thing we need is some over-zealous Secret Service twirp to...
in case I need it?
Do IT!  SHOOT HIM!
You coulda told me what you were doing.
Yeah.  His dream and our worst nightmare.
What do we do?    Lean into it.
The only thing I could think of would be... you'd have to get rid of the queen.
No.
Come on now.  People are smart.
So... now what?  Cattle call again?
Yeah, Kay?
Noon exactly.
Did he say where?
How'd you know that?  Kay?
As far as I can tell, the guy's what he says he is - alone, and unarmed.  All he wants is five minutes to introduce himself to the public.
And get this: you know how humans evolved from primates?  Well guess what the dominant life form on planet evolved from?
A good question.  And a simple answer.  No more hunger.  No more smog. No more overpopulation.  No more war.
Wally!
Take it.
Agatha --
Anderton --
She died?
What --
I know that, but I wanna keep the old ones.
You're part of my flock now, John. Welcome.
And you say the third prevision was, what, a little fuzzy or something?
What?
She's worried about you.  And, quite frankly, so am I.
Somebody named Leo Crow.
All right, John, just take a breath, let's think about this...
I can't.  They're following me right now.  They'll meet me there. They'll halo me.
No doubt.
Go ahead.
Uh-huh.  Jad?
Confirm with trig and image.
Any ID on the shooter yet?
Because it was going to fall.
It was Iris Hineman.  She developed the Precogs, designed the system and pioneered the interface.
There's no question.  You don't have any.
There hasn't been a murder in six years.  There's nothing wrong with the system.  It's perfect.
I can't touch you!  And John, you can't be in here!  You'll confuse them!
She was looking right at me.
Are you reading my mind right now?
I tell you what.  I do this, I get to keep whatever images I get from her head.
Stop --
I'm your son.  I'm you.
Some -- somebody's father?
You're not gonna kill me?
Let go of the gun.
Just what is it you think I can do for you?
You don't seem all that proud.
Yes, of course, he knew, but at the time, he felt -- we both felt their existence was... an insignificant variable.
I'm not gonna kill anybody.
Why should I trust you?
You shouldn't.  You shouldn't trust anyone... certainly not the Attorney General who wants it all for himself.  Not the young federal agent who wants your job.  Not even the old man who just wants to hang onto what he's created.  Don't trust anyone.  Just find the Minority Report.
I said the record is destroyed. The original report exists for all time.  I designed the system so that whenever a report occurred, it would be stored in a safe place -- but not declared.
-- and then walk out.
Actually, I think you'll have to run out, but yes, that's what you have to do.
Nothing.  I didn't kill him.
The man lost a child, for Christ's sake...
Six years ago.  What did you two talk about yesterday afternoon?
Lamar, I found something.
Near Death's real popular right now, which includes everything from getting hit by a car, to falling off a high building to plane crashes.  It's a big rush, you come out the other side without a heart attack.
Uh, yeah, being concert master of the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra is one of our most popular choices...
Because of the nature of murder.  "There's nothing more destructive to the metaphysical fabric that binds us than the untimely murder of one human being by another".
Anderton's smart enough to go where electronic billboards and other media can't ID him to pick his pocket.  There's fewer consumers down there, which means fewer scanners to target him.
No offense, sir, but why wouldn't he just run?
I think you're swell company, Knott.
The man across the street.  I've seen him before...
I don't have any cream.  Sorry.
You ever heard him mention the name Leo Crow?
You said in your divorce papers that he tried to kill himself.
Maybe if he'd taken one of the males.  But the female, she's the key.  She's the one they listen to, the one with the most talent.  The one who takes care of the other two.
What are you talking about?
Now, Mr. Slade, you're in room 315.
Just give me the key. I'm gonna stay here.
Manhattan.
I got news for you, Horrace got his ass out of there before you did.
What's wrong, baby?
It's a poison arrow tree frog.
I gotta go, baby. I love you. Tell mommy I called. You be a big girl and be careful when you're alone.
They requested her. It was her gig. Max put me on as a favor.
The only way he'll go with Ricky is if you're in too.
No coke tonight.  Right?
Ho's a good guy --
But what about them?
What's your record at?
Yeah, sure.
He making the drop?
Ruiz don't like using names on cell phones. He refers to him as the Red Dragon.
We go and hang out with the dude, make him happy, drink some tea, whatever it takes, until he feels comfortable enough to bring it up on his own. We make the drop, go home to California.
He must have that shit troughed.
Heard of them.
They ran shit back in the Eighties. Used to cut motherfuckers heads off and sit them on the bar. That's back when the Irish was making a play against the Italians. I don't know if they still around, but I don't fuck with those motherfuckers just in case.
It sounds to me like everybody's just a little jumpy. And since all it is is a drop, the Welshman's got nothing at stake. I say we go to his 'troughed off' bar. It'll calm his nerves, we drop the bag, and we all get back to our lives.
This is it.
A million. Easy.
No.
You told him you liked him.
Yeah. Sure.
What is it?
That's him. Now you all know the drill, right?
What's the plan?
Hi. I, uh, think that's us.
You don't know where you're going?
Spa?
Understand me?
I'm on the phone.
Ruiz isn't here.
I'll page you.
Cause if you don't know the number, I can page you with the number so you'll have the number.
I will.
I'll page you with the number.
I thought you hate that club.
I do. It's a fuckin Persian Palace.
Come on, man. Not with the owners here.
Please. I got three inches on you. You wouldn't have landed a punch if I didn't let you.
Max won't let me drive Jess to dance anymore.
What's the movie?
Unless we're supposed to whack out the fuckin' pilot, I don't think we're gonna have to work in the next five hours.
How much is it?
Forty-six.
Jesus, man. Plus ten?
Yeah, I guess.
Shit. It's thirty-five cents. You got a dime?
They said a hundred thirty-fifth and Twelfth.
They asked who it was.
Sold it, stole it, whatever...
Motherfucker...
C'mon, man...
The what?
We don't need guns.
You wouldn't even know where to get one.
No more, man.
Look. They're together. You telling me this ain't a set-up?
And you grew up in Manhattan?
Yeah, but, we're good. You know what I mean?
You look good, man.
The videos.
Yes.
Why? What I say bad?
Ruiz? Oh, he ain't here.
No?
Well, I didn't care for the club much. And, I must say, I didn't care for him either.
No, really, mate?
I handle most of Cardiff Giant's stuff.
Sure. You boys want anything?
So tell me how it is.
Who's gonna outfit us?
Shut it, man. Shut it. Tom is a square. He don't but dabble in shit. Maxie had me hook up a loan-back with him, through an Austrian passbook account.
Well, that's news to me. The name's Tom.
Well, word on the street is you're Welsh.
Sit down. We ain't fixing to eat you. You look brand new in town. Pretty handy with a bottle.
When they want your ass, won't nothing keep you out.
You ain't bullshitting me, is you, boy?
Why?
I'm working on it.
I'm there, daddy. Wheww. I'm cool enough to kill.
Daddy, where's my money?
I don't know. It doesn't matter. The thing is we got to get you back on your feet.
Yeah. I got a couple a new angles ain't been figured yet. All I need's a stake and a  chance --
Yeah, got to do something about you.
You need something. It's not a reefer, but it'll help some.
You ain't lying.
What? Everybody knows God is White.
Then what you telling me to study in them for?
Look 'em up and and out what they mean.
Ole Pete ain't much in the head, but he can lay in there with the wood.
-- the hardest and the greatest.
-- the hardest and the greatest.
Next week, Brother Minister.
I see your point.
That's something I haven't done in fifteen years.
You have enough worries of your own.
But Brother Bembry says I'm tall enough for a tall man.
The talk is everywhere!
There's always talk, always been talk, and always will be talk. Don't they say how I'm trying to take over the Nation, how I'm getting rich off the Nation?
No, what's the matter with you? Wake up! Are you so dedicated that you have blinded yourself? Are you so committed you cannot face the truth? Bembry is the editor of the newspaper you established. Ask him why your name hasn't been in "Muhammad Speaks" in over a year? Ask him why you rate front page in every paper in the country, but not a single sentence in your own.
A long time ago. You've repaid them many times over. Ask them why they have new cars and houses full of new furniture.
Is that what this is about? Material wealth?
I want to also, but until we are instructed by the Messenger to do so, we will just wait and pray.
Brother Earl.
Reverend Chickenwing called last night and said he wouldn't be able to attend.
Now just a moment, just a moment --
Mr. X is a demagogue. He has no place to go, so he exaggerates. He's a disservice to every good law-abiding Negro in the country. Can I ask you a question?
Entirely.
No, each of us must relearn that work is the only worthwhile thing. Allah has given you a great gift. Use it wisely, never forgetting that we are nothing, while He is all.
Can I ask you something?
'Bout every other night, Red.
I mean it's late, baby.
These are my children. Mine. And they ain't no question. None.
How many you turning out?
Well, all right, then.
Hey, man, gimme some skin.
The hell you are.
Palmed it right in the goddam chamber.
I'm half wop, half nigger and ain't afraid of no one.
That's right.
Are you sure?
I didn't know then that I was a nigger.
Good grades. Fine athlete. President of his class.
Am I a suspect?
It's what you and Rosanna named me. Right?
I don't know shit about you.
Then I hope the one who gets me has got lots of kids. What do you want?
My deal is with Rosanna. I knew you guys were up to something. Are you two fucking?
[Where are you coming from?]
[South America.]
[Where are you staying in Mexico?]
[What's the PIN number?]
[Do you know who I am?]
[I'm professional. I just do my job.]
Who's he?
[How do I recognize him.]
[Listen! I will give you a life for a life.]
[Do you know who I am? I am the commandante of the Judicial anti- kidnapping division.]
[Please, don't...]
[That's all I know! Please. I'm sorry for the girl. But it was business! I'm a professional.]
How long you staying, Crease?
A bodyguard has to be close to someone all the time. Willing to talk. I'm not good at that.
If they like me.
No.
We're taking a different way home.
No.
It wasn't a school like yours and there was no Sister Anna.
Pinta, do you have a pencil?
You're fast.
They'll be back in a week.
Do you always sleep with him?
How's the ankle? Can you put your weight on it?
I had to do my homework on them when I worked there. Also I enjoy history.
What did you do in Asia? Is that where you met the man with cigarettes?
I'm sorry.
I know you're not.
You don't drink like you used to.
I'm going to keep people safe someday. Just like you.
Dyslexic?
Bye, Mom.
These people are professionals. They don't waste their time taking children whose fathers are virtually bankrupt.
He has experience in related work. A great deal of it.
I think it's nice he's American.
[A bodyguard was shot trying to protect a 9 year old. The bodyguard's American. Not only that he's black.]
[No. Not by the rules of polite society at least.]
[You only give information so you can fuck me.]
[And as long as we're talking information, there's something else as well.]
None of your business. Or mine for that matter. I got nothing more to say.
This is my jurisdiction. I want these men as much as Creasy does.
You told me that she was a little tall, but that she wasn't bad looking at all.
What?
Well, we oughta do something. It's Saturday night. I don't wanna go bowling like last Saturday. How about calling up that big girl we picked up inna movies about a month ago in the RKO Chester?
Yeah, sure.
We gotta whole pot inna kitchen. We give you a plate-a your own.
I didn't think she was so bad-looking.
Brush her. Listen, you wanna come with me tonight, or you wanna go with this dog?
Oh.
What they say?
Oh, Catherine, please! Don't make a tragedy. You come to my house where you know you be happier yourself.
Were the lights on?
I think you're kidding yourself, Clara. I used to think about moving out, you know? And that's what I used to say. "My mother needs me." But when you really get down to it, that ain't it at all. Actually, you need your father. You know what I mean? You're living at home, and you got your father and mother there, and you can go on like that -- being a little girl all your life.
Actually, I don't make friends easily.
So I was telling you, my kid brother Nickie got married last Sunday. That was a very nice affair. And they had this statue of some woman, and they had whiskey spouting outta her mouth. I never saw anything so grand in my life.  And watta meal. I'm a butcher, so I know a good hunka steak when I see one. That was choice filet, right off the toppa the chuck. A buck eighty a pound. Of course, if you wanna cheaper cut, get rib steak. That gotta lotta waste on it, but it comes to about a buck and a quarter a pound, if it's trimmed. Listen, Clara, make yourself comfortable. You're all tense.
Marty...
Please...
Please...
Okay, so I'll see you tomorrow night then.
Hobby! What can she do? She cooks and she cleans. You gotta have a house to clean. You gotta have children to cook for. These are the terrible years for a woman, the terrible years.
No, I'm not kidding.
She was always a bit thin in the hips...
Marty, see that my mother is nice and comfortable, eh?
Sure. This girl said...
It's loaded with what?
I'm ugly... I'm ugly! I'm UGLY!
Don't bring her to the house no more.
Hiya, Ralph...
So, Marty, lemme tell you about these nurses, Marty...
What nurses?
Get ridda her. This is money inna bank.
He says okay, it's all right Catherine comes here.
Hello, Thomas.
So what happened, Aunt Theresa, about the milk bottle was my mother-in- law, she comes inna kitchen, Aunt Theresa, and she begins poking her head over my shoulder here and poking her head over my shoulder there, so then she begins telling me how I waste money and how I can't cook, and how I'm raising my baby all wrong, so she got me so nervous, I spilled some milk I was making for the baby...
No, Virginia, I know how you feel.
That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa.
You talked to Walt?
Put in one of your fixes. Walt knows he's loused himself with the Church, but it's part of our plan to make him think he has the keys to the kingdom. Which he will think if you grease the skids for him.
I don't think I can give absolution to a man who's about to commit suicide. It's a mortal sin.
I believe it takes both. I'd have to look it up.
Don't you know the first thing you're supposed to do at a new post is present yourself to the commanding officer with your orders?
Good. You've both been working close to the front.
Yes, O'Reilly?
I mean, what were you doing? Were you a resident or on a staff someplace?
Is there any reason why we shouldn't know the name of it?
Because is not democrash? All peoples created equal?
This is Ho-Jon, my houseboy. Our houseboy. I'm teaching him English.
The door, Frank, the door! Where you from anyhow, Alaska?
The chest-cutter.
Not without lots of praying and kissing the dice.  It's a different ritual but it works the same.
Hail to the chief! We-all got a responsibility, men. He's crowned like a king ought to be, but he can't just walk to the Mess Hall by himself. He has to be carried by native bearers.
Never mind. Forget it.
What's he got to write, for God's sake?
Don't try to get it far down. Kick it up high so we can get there and surround that son-ofa-bitch.
When?
We could steal one of the choppers.
Godless buffoons, all of them.
...And for our young men on the field of battle, that they may return home to their dear ones...
I want to talk to you, Pierce.
Obviously you don't think so, and I don't know why.
And there it is.
That's the front up the road a few miles. We have to get by without some of the comforts of home.
...But I turned in my knee pads.
We're throwing him a Last Supper. We came to invite you.
Did I ever tell you about Me Lay Marston?
Your high school friend who went around saying 'Me lay, you lay?' to all the young females in the community. As I remember, you said it was quite a successful approach.
Best thing you could do for all of us is grab some sack time.
We'll need room. The sixth rib goes.
Never mind the conversation. Do it, Dad.
You have a certain modest charm yourself.
Very happily married.
You're asking for somebody else?
What do you care? You'll be on your way to Japan.
Yes, I know. Hi, Ho-Jon. How did it go?
I don't liking it at all, what I hear when I listen to the heart. And such a blood pressure for so young a boys. Is frightening.
At first is no doubt. But then I am seeing on his paper he work in American hospital. And I think there are so many drugs in such a places, he could take some by mistake.
The real Trapper John? The one who threw you the famous pass and went to greater glory on the Boston and Maine Railroad?
The one and only.
I have but well, you know, I've been mainly an anesthetist a long time now and... well, I'd like you guys to take a look at him.
Glad to know you. Drop in at my clinic anytime you feel like playing a little poker, or even if a tooth is bothering you.
Now I know that's been my problem since I was a kid. But it only caught up to me last night.
But it's all over now, and I can't face it. Imagine if you found out you were one, you wouldn't like breaking the news to your wife. Well, I got the same problem multiplied.
In the direction you want to go.
You can cut the bow.
Hi, Ho-Jon. How they goin'?
We got it, men... Ho-Jon's keep as Androscoggin... if there is such a place. And the big news is, the General wants a rematch.
O'Reilly, what is it?  There aren't more choppers coming?
Captain...  'This kid' is a prisoner of war.
Planes mostly. May take a crack at rickshaws. How does the direct approach work over here?
Never mind.
The address of the N.E.P.H. and W. Why don't you meet me there when you're through golf for drinks and dinner and whatever strikes the fancy?
Soup? Rice? What are we doing, beginning all over again?
Can you guys take one minute to look at a kid for me?
How is he?
Oh, come on, now. This is serious. You're a man disgusted with all of civilization.
With all of it?
Look, it started as a circulation stunt, didn't it?
Well, you got your circulation. Now, why don't you let me alone?
Well, a tall handsome Ubangi, I suppose.
Ted Sheldon.
But here's the funniest part of it all. I was the fella up there doing the marrying. You know, the Justice of the Peace or something . . .
You were? I thought you were chasing me?
How many people do you think we've talked to already, outside the radio, I mean?
Did you write this?
. . . Er, this John Doe idea is yours, huh?
Money?  Well, I'm glad to hear somebody admit it. Do you suppose you could write a radio speech that would put that fellow over?
Tomorrow night, before a crowd of fifteen thousand people, and talking over a nation-wide radio hook-up, John Doe will announce the formation of a third party.
Hello?
Stick a fork through me! I'm done. I'll never get this speech right.
Darling, there are so many complaining political speeches. People are tired of hearing nothing but doom and despair on the radio. If you're going to have him say anything, why don't you let him say something simple and real, something with hope in it? If your father were alive, he'd know what to say.
Father's . . . I never knew he had a diary.
Say that again.
Now, then comes the drama. He meets discouragement. He finds the world has feet of clay. His ideals crumble. So what does he do?  He decides to commit suicide in protest against the state of civilization. He thinks of the river!  But no, no, he has a better idea. The City Hall. Why?  Because he wants to attract attention. He wants to get a few things off his chest, and that's the only way he can get himself heard.
Oh, swell! Is that the contract? 
Friend of his. They play duets together.
Have you seen him?
Both of 'em?
Sure. Mostly often.
Holy smoke! A half a heelot!
No!
Tear down all the fences. Why, if you tore one picket off of your neighbor's fence he'd sue you!
Four bits.
No, I never read the speeches before I make them. I get more of a kick out of it that way.
Yeah?  Say, you're sold on the John Doe idea, aren't you?
How about family? Got any family?
There's nobody holding you here, Mr. Doe.  It's only natural that peopleâ€
That's a lie!
What difference does that make?
Did you write itâ€”or didn't you?
Ah, you bet your life you didn't! You look in your papers, ladies and gentlemen, and you'll find Miss Mitchell's signed confession that she was the one that wrote it!
Nineteen!
How?
What?
Out the window! Something just flew by!
Is there a crowd in the street?
SWAT wants to go in.
Not that we know of.
I've got to stop in there... Mr. Korda, do you know Frank Antonucci?
Could I please have a little water?
Perhaps for his own reasons he entangled me in this... situation.
Don't make do it, Mike.
Tell my dad.
You signed out twice.
Being faxed over now.
Yeah.
We're already past it, aren't we, Kevin?
It was okay.
I grew up in Oakland... Crossed the Bay Bridge and here I was.  So you're looking for "fast advancement".
So what do I say to this guy?
Why?
That's okay. That's his style.
To run last?
He's got the girl.
How many have you lost?
Ray, think about how she looked when you married her. Think about how happy you were. Don't lose that, man. Don't give up everything.
Oh, hell, forget it. This won't work.
You think I didn't need you?
Mmm, needs a little something.
When?
Know what you are?! You're a prude, Roper.
What?
Who's running it?
Are these yours?
System's running on auxiliary.  Only seven hours before it crashes.
True.
There you are, sitting next to the creator, what do you say?
You don't have much sex up there in the real world, do you?
What's happening?
The patterns were moved around, but they weren't changed.
Halden sent men to kill me in my sleep, but simple illusions won out.  So he now sends the legend to finish the deed.
Yes.
God creates man, man creates technology, technology creates God.  End into beginning.
What about the customers with reservations?
Doesn't make sense.  How the hell does some fucking teenager get to the keys?
He had access to the keys --
We can be there in fifteen minutes and rip him off the system.
You've got the keys, send someone in --
Why would I do that?
Try harder.
Where?
We worked together on the inside. You were on my programming team --
But you were with me.
I'm sorry.
Sorry?!
Why not?
It was just there.
Just like that?
Program name?
Resurrection.
Alpha.  Is there any way we can defeat this  monster?  Any way at all?
Yeah, right.
Aisha, you are the Bear, stalwart and bold.
It is said that once you've reached the power... you have only ten triacs to release it.
I am the wolf, cunning and swift!
NINJA CRANE ZORD!
IMPACT IN FIFTEEN SECONDS!
Bulk... why don't we give Mr. Peep here a chance to think it over?
... A falcon?
GET OFF ME!
I hope those Rangers put that lousy lowlife out of his misery!
Anybody see them?
THREE SECONDS!!
NINJA APE ZORD!
We're asking you to go to prison.
Hey, I ignore my wife too. But on our honeymoon I paid attention.
Maybe you better hear what I got to say first.
Life knocked me back.
I came into this world flat on my ass.
Scotch is a very valuable commodity these days.
I got my partner in there!
We'll start small. When we got 'em lined up, we increase the supply a bit at a time. Only sell the best stuff. And keep the price high, 'cause ya know how folks hate the taste of cheap booze.
They told me you wanted to talk about this Shane business.
It consoles the bereaved family ta see the perpetrator take his load of juice. We try to oblige.
Who hired the bastard?
Mr. Costello handles our business with the government agencies.
We're gonna be the winning side. It's like Rothstein said about that guy in Austria. We're gonna use Maranzano and Masseria. Let 'em knock each other bloody. And then, when everybody's screamin' for peace, we step in to make it. What they're fight in' over, everybody will beg us to take.
No. They envy you.
Same here.
It's too late.
Why? You're the innocent one.
Charlie?
I'm gonna lose you, Charlie.
Charlie, I'm from the old country, and these American ways get me sometimes confused. You tellin' us you refuse the title of Boss of All the Bosses?
You fellas got names?
Meyer just finished the books.
Bugsy, you and I don't need to be in business with Maranzano. We got more jobs than we can handle. That's not the problem.
So we end up with everybody but the two Bosses, at our meet. We ain't sayin' we're the leaders, but we're leadin'.
Is there a fuckin' point comin' up anytime soon?
What you mean? Tommy ain't done nothin'.
You're a smart boy, Charlie, but there's somethin' you ain't learned yet. A man needs a family.
I got a place for you. In my family... or in the cemetery.
So tell me when I ain't done it.
How can I trust you when you look at me like that?
Good liquor draws a good crowd.
Then perhaps you need to know me.
Salvatore. My young Caesar. First me, Sallie. Then you.
And how many soldiers do you have?
I have six hundred. Soldiers. And more every week off the boat.
We combine everything. You are my second in command.
And the Jews?
We learn from life.
The terms will be mine.
We were overdue to get hit.
Shuddup.
Johnson's still on board. Even Maranzano won't screw with Nucky in Atlantic City. But everywhere else, we got nothing but problems.
Masseria's scared. He might make our deal.
Guess I'm just lucky.
Switch hands.
What?
What's the maximum safe dose?
Dark Town. Land of nightmares. I'm Bull.
Hey, Stu, why so glum? Everybody loves a good humiliation nightmare.
Death, I'm trying to make things right. Take my soul. Turn me into a paper doll. But give me just one lousy hour.
Back in your head, where he belongs. <i></i> No offense, Stu, but on your own you're kinda vanilla. I didn't want to send you back without him.
Burger God. The ones that found the pig hair in the french fries?
No. I want to give him <u>more</u>. I want to give him a massive dose.
That's not going to stop his nightmare -
Stu, I like you personally, I admire your work, but I'm just the God of Sleep. This is Death's bailiwick.
Sorry, Steve, maybe next time. And how's our new guest settling in - ?
The monkey, of course. It was his idea.
Oh, baby, I can't believe you're back.
You're acting kind of...odd.
It was you who got the standing O. It was you drawing on the belly over there...
Can't you give it to me later?
How was it? I don't recall.
What's the matter?
Hypnos?
How am I gonna get past the guards?
Come on, pal! It was a compliment! You'da done the same if you had the equipment!
I've been stuck down here for <u>months</u>. Somebody had better start paying attention, or I'm gonna - I'm gonna <u>kick ass</u>!
Fine! Don't put yourself out. I'll go to the land of Death alone.
IT'S NOT WORKING.
My daughter lives across the street from you people and she tells me that you keep this area safe.  Is that true?
What about yesterday?  Kicking that poor boy?
Is there something else I can do for you?
So, what do you think?
Well, when I walked up the block, I ... well, my word!
Behind the books.
Don, this is my mother.  Mom, this is my boss, Don Palmer.
At my age, I'm going to take any pill that makes me feel better.
Where to?
Uh, yes.  My husband passed away recently ...
... Oh ...
You mean it's dangerous?
It was?
Positively not in the station! Gone!
Hey--you're into me for a buck already. I say--McGann. Shoot the whole dollar.
Huh?
Diz, you're a swell playmate--but--. Maybe if I saw you once with your hair combed, or something--or--no, no--I don't think even that would do it--
Well, if you're sure it wouldn't--no use combing my hair for nothing.
No--don't do it. I'm sure. The truth is, Diz--there's no man I've seen yet or--must be something wrong with me. I've been feeling low for weeks.
Will you go chase an ambulance!
What show? Would you mind telling me what's coming off here?
What dame?
Nothing. I'm just saying--I might be able to lie, cheat, steal--and I'd still tear into a guy I saw kicking a dog. Not that *he* is, by a long shot--
Why do I always laugh at that?
Yeah.
Do you know how I felt, Diz?
Well--cut it out. See? Who *cares* anyway?
You--you've been a good egg, Diz. Maybe we could clear out of this town--get to feel like *people*--get the habit of lifting up our eyes-- live like we just got out of a tunnel.
Yeah--that's right. Diz--
What?
Now, now, Emma, dear--you mustn't forget we have been chosen by the people of this commonwealth to--
No wonder--without your dinner.
All set. Foley's rooms in the Senate office building--nice, big clean desk--lot of Senator stationery to write his little boys on--and Foley's secretary, Saunders, to make it look like the real thing--
Your name's spreading like wild-fire out here--you are the winterbook favorite to get on the National ticket.
Happy, we've got the man. Horace Miller!
--a *boy ranger* a squirrel chaser-- to the United States Senate!
*But you never asked me*!
Boy Ranger! The answer to a prayer. Manna from heaven! Didn't know the time of day--!
Aw--
"Boy Stuff." That's the name of Jeff's magazine. He prints it.  Look--here's one--oh, it's great-- *everybody* reads it--all the kids in the State--a million of 'em. Look, Pop--let me read you a--
Than what?
Look! There it is!
Shot in the back. I was there. I can see him at that old roll top desk, still with his hat on... still with his hat on...
I mean, sir--if I'm going to stay in the Senate--I ought to know what I'm doing--at least, I ought to try to study the Bills that are coming up--
Senator Paine, if I could do just that one thing while I'm here, I-- I'd feel that I--
What's to stop you? Saunders will help you with it--
He has imputed to me conduct unworthy a Senator--and I demand he be made to yield the floor--!
Yes, sir, I yield for a question.
Excuse me for interrupting, Governor, but--  --that plaster's gonna harden any second, son.
Hello, Jefferson.
Hello, Ma.  Clarissa, Ma. She'll be stayin' a while--
Yes! I've told Senator Paine for twenty years--
Gee, I'm sorry. You see, it wasn't until I was fairly well along in the bus that I realized--
Punch?
My dear Senator, have you the faintest idea of what it takes to get a Bill passed?
Tonight.
You get to your feet in the Senate and present it. Then you take the Bill and put it in a little box-- like a letter box--on the side of the rostrum. Just hold it between thumb and forefinger and drop it in. Clerks read it and refer it to the right committee--
That's the order of business. Your Bill has to stand *way* back there in line unless the Steering Committee decides it is important enough to be--
Do you really think we're getting anywhere.
Try sitting down.
Well--gosh--that--that isn't "particulars," is it?
You mean--here?
City-dwellers never do that--for fear of what might drop *in* 'em.
I don't see where we are *with* it.
Go right ahead.
It *is* not!
Susan! Susan Paine--that's beautiful--
Do you want to dictate them?
*Who*! Miss--! Is that--? Why didn't you--? Holy smoke;  H-hello... Yes, Miss Paine... How-- how are you, Miss Paine...? What?... Escort *you* Gee--I mean--*sure*-- *yes*! I'd be--. Reception for a *princess*! Gosh!... Thanks, Miss Paine. Yes. I--I'll be there! Goodbye, Miss Paine.  Did you hear that?--Escort Susan Paine--reception for a princess! Imagine her calling me--asking *me*-- !
What you *have* to do is fight!
Oh--Saunders--
Well, goodbye, sir--and thank you again.  Well--it--it was nice seeing you, Miss Paine--
"So help me God."
"--We hold these truths to be self- evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights--"  Well--looks like the night shift's comin' on.
Since the time of Adams--not Washington.
What! Who?
The ranger's notices? No idea at all.
You see--Governor Hopper made an appointment in this case that--well, Jeff isn't exactly fitted to the work, let's say. He's here to see monuments--and pass the time. That's important to--to my work--and everybody concerned. So, someone who can be trusted has to occupy him and keep him out of trouble--
Saunders--it's going to go pretty bad for Jeff tomorrow. There's only one thing that can be done for him now--  I--I've written his resignation. He resigns under protest--denying all charges. No one will ever be sure if he was guilty or not. It leaves him with at least a shred of honor. The other way--branded openly in the Senate--expelled--he'll never live it down. Rather a simple compromise than utter ruin. In a year--the whole thing might be forgotten--
Why don't you do it yourself?
What are you talking about? What difference--?
I thought I could, too.  *My* business--this fine future! I have no future I *care* about, if this boy is broken! I--I can't sleep. The only important thing in my life now is to save what I can for him. I want him to get a start again--I'll see that he's taken care of as long as he lives--!  Saunders--whether you ever mean anything to him or not--
*Me! Me*! I *still* don't see why I should--! If you love him so much, why don't you go to him yourself and-- ? Or better still--get up in that Senate and *fight* for him!
We can't drop it now, Joe. We bought the land around this Dam and we're holding it in dummy names. If we drop it or delay it--we are going to bring about investigations, and investigations will show that we own that land and are trying to sell it to the State under phoney names. No, Joe, in my judgment the only thing to do is push this Dam through--and get it over with.
You won't stand for it?
Glad to know you, Senator. Meet the boys--
You can't say *that* to--
It's crucifying him--!
How nice.
Senator Paine.
Senator Paine will state it!
Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?
He's still pixilated.
No.
You don't go out with girls very much, do you?
Did you subsequently write a series of articles about him?
Are they true!
It isn't all! I'd like to explainâ€
You were a lady in distress, weren't you?
What did they say?
Have you seen the papers?
I'm from a small town too, you know.
Oh, I suppose you could do better.
Sure. I can sing "Humoresque."
The reason why I wanted to take a walk, Mary, is 'cause I wanted to talk to you.
All my life, I've wanted somebody to talk to. Back in Mandrake Falls, I always used to talk to a girl.
Aw, cut it out, will you? You'll get me thinking about Charlie again.
Tell him I had to leave suddenly. I got a job in China - some place.
Oh, he's not getting away with anything.
With pay!
I even moved into Mabel Dawson's apartment - in case old snoopy Cobb might start looking around.
With pay!  She is out the door.
This is for you , Mac. The names of all the headwaiters in town. You can always buy a bit of choice scandal from them at reasonable prices.
Will you show Mr. Hallor to the front door?
Yes, sir.
Oh, yes, sir. Here it is, sir. The pate de fois gras, sir.
Yeah, that's fine. Have a lot of it because she likes it.
Relatives of old man Semple.
I'm not interested in the newspapers.
Yes, I know. My first concern is to locate the lucky man. When I do, it's your job to keep the newspapers away from him.
How do you do.
Well, he passed on. He was killed in a motor accident in Italy.
Are you a married man, Mr. Deeds?
No?
Why not? Who is he?
Come in, please. Come in. Can I get you a cup of tea?
No, I'm his housekeeper.
Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington. Funny, I can't think of a rhyme for Budington.
Oh, sure. Sure. We don't want to fire Arthur.
Some other time, Cobb. Some other time.
I think I'll go down and punch this editor on the nose.
Not editors. Take my word for it. Not editors!
Just as I suspected, wise guy! I don't mind you making a sap out of yourself - but you made one out of me, too.
What about your knocking off for lunch?
Oh Yes, of course - you've just been elected.
Why, the Chairman presides at the meetings.
Me?!
You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted like any ordinary business.
Oh, yes. Yes, of course Dr. Von Holler. Very interesting.
A farmer, eh! You're a moocher, that's what you are! I wouldn't believe you or anybody else on a stack of bibles! You're a moocher like all the rest of them around here, so get out of here!
Here's the order for the plows. We got a good price on them.
Mrs. Semple?
What about it, Mr. Deeds?
Yes. Have you any peculiar characteristics when you are creating?
Now about the Falkner sisters. That's kind of funny. I mean about Mr. Cedar going all the way to Mandrake Falls to bring them here. Do you mind if I talk to them?
Anything else, Mr. Deeds?
Uh-huh.
Oh, what a magnificent deflation of smugness. Pal, you've added ten years to my life!  A poet with a straight left and a right hook - delicious! Delicious!  You're my guest from now on - forever and a day - even unto eternity!
He's got a lot of foolish notions - about saving a lady in distress.
You meanâ€  â€”by the neck or something?
Yes, lovely. We've had a lot of nice weather lately.
What - tails?  Why, that's a monkey suit![5] Do you want people to laugh at me?  I never wore one of those things in my life.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Oh. Oh!  Has Miss Dawson called yet?
What do you mean? I remember everything!  Hand me my pants - I wrote her phone number on a piece of paper.
Madame Pomponi. She says everything is all set for the reception.
Doubtful. What did he say?
Uh-huh.
Syndrome... Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.
Were you supposed to have a session?
Thank you.
Dr. Delbanco. It's nice to see you again.
...I won't go into that today. Though, if we should continue these sessions, as I certainly hope we will, there are some aspects of that I would like to look at. God knows, I've listened to enough people giving me the juicy --  ...At any rate, I just wanted to acknowledge the catalyzing effect your comment had on me. I just hope that it doesn't come roiling back upon you like some dreadful undertow.
I see.
Now hold on, I didn't say I didn't want to come --
Or maybe it wasn't an accident at all --
Why? I'm paying for this.
It doesn't matter how I feel about it. It's how you feel about it that matters.
Let me just say something here... I have no idea if this is going to help.
No thanks. Plenty of time for that when we're a little further along.
You must be Dr. Mumford of Mumford. Jeremy Brockett.
I thought it was -- Nobody ever said, "I should have spent more time at the office."
Well, in '85 four of us left our firms and formed an investment banking venture. We've got twenty-three people working there now.
What do you think's wrong with her?
That's a lot of people all at once.
Salad nicoise? I love salad nicoise.
Does the phrase "nosy" have any meaning to you, Lily?
Okay.
That's it? That's what you're giving me?
Don't need it.
I just got my license two weeks ago.
I been drivin' since I was twelve.
What's wrong with her?
We're going for a walk.
What do you mean?
No, I really don't.
Just who is here, can you tell me?
Could I see Sofie, please?
Sofie. It's so obvious... you're after my daughter.
Feel free to lie down. Most people do.
I don't think I can afford it. I don't want my dad paying.
Is it contagious? 'Cause everyone agrees my immune system's way down.
Please... forgive me.
Is this the treatment?
Sorry... I'm done.
Is that like a party trick?
There... I've given myself a real whopper.
That was really bad, wasn't it?
And I'll bet you can interpret the whole thing
Is that when you split up?
My brother said you were about to fire me.
Sofie...
We're only talking about six weeks.
Why do you think you tell me, Nessa?
What are you doing? We're not done. I just need to find the thing...
I want to have the session. I thought it would be cool if I could show you some of the things that interest me. But I guess you're not into it... which we already knew.
What are you talking about?
I don't think you know what you're talking about.
...I mean, Doc, the dude is seriously deluded. I said that to him, I said, "If you think I'm gonna do all that shit for you, man, you are seriously deluded."
I said I'd consider it. Nobody owns me. And the last thing was insane. I don't know what's wrong with him... No magazines.
I've got three big ones.
This is great!
Okay then.  Have you got a lot of friends?
Well, there's Lily.
So I guess Henry Follett is a patient of yours. He's my pharmacist.
Doc. I know we're not supposed to get together till Wednesday...
Hey, maybe that's all right! I don't know all that much about psychology or therapy or... ethics, so maybe there's something I missed... or something...
Yeah, well... what I was gonna tell you --
-- Skip. Knowing what you do about me --
That's right. And you also know that even though I make 23% of the modems in the world... I cannot make one simple connection with any woman who could truly love me.
And that's your secret?  You meant -- like a trade secret?
What it felt like was... a series of separate, unconnected lives -- hillbilly kid, wrecked college boy, garbage man, civil service guy...  ...et cetera... et cetera. Every time I'd leave a life, it felt good. Whatever problems I was having were suddenly gone. I had no friends and I didn't talk to my family. The only constant, stabilizing force in my life was... drugs.
But look at me now...
I'm honored.
Hmm. I guess that doesn't help... I see where you're going here. It's a mess.
I suppose your extended training was at an institution in that area?
How'd a guy like you end up in the Legion anyways?
I got caught robbing a synagogue. Lots of good stuff in them holy places; churches, temples, mosques, and who's guarding them?
Why do you like to fight so much?
You shall see.
I will give you one hundred pounds to spare his life.
A bright good morning to all.
Every damn day.
Yes.
Give... give him... give him GLAAAA-- !
Well of course I can swim, if the occasion calls for it.
Oh my god, It's a preparation room.
I know, you're wondering, what's a place like me doing in a girl like this?
Not unless you call me Rick.
Having an encounter with a four thousand year old walking-talking corpse tends to convert one.
Forget it, we're out the door down the hall and gone.
Then we'll have to find some immortal ones.
He's here! I saw him! That thing is here!
Undoubtedly, I know the breed, he may be a cowboy, but his word is his word.
Sit down, O'Connell, sit down, we could use another good player.
We coulda had 'em for free, all we had to do was give 'em your sister.
Where's my gun?
You did not!?... We're not!?
Damn-it! That's two down and only two to go.
Believe it, sister. That's what brought our buddy back to life.
And I know the terrible revenge that you plan to inflict on this city.
When was that?
That boy's got talent.
What did you do with Captain Amazing?
I hope you won't take this the wrong way, but I couldn't help but notice... that you're a dead ringer for Veronica Lake in "The Blue Dahlia".
Are you an actress?
How 'bout giving me "the tour"?
I'd better go.
Yeah.
What does it matter? Women just want to control you -- and talk about their feelings. They want to know why you're angry all the time -- and what can they can do to help -- so you tell them there's nothing -- nothing -- just leave me alone -- but they bug you and they bug you and they bug you -- until you just can't stand it anymore! -- so you finally open up -- you pop like a blister -- and it all comes spewing out -- all your emotions -- your feelings -- your fears -- all of it!  And then they dump you.
He's turned into a completely normal person!
Not yet.
Mother... it's not what you think!
And why are you wearing that silly costume?
It is?
She likes you.
And there's the Sphinx.
We've got lift off!
I have no doubt that he has, Your Majesty, but does he have any strong moves from which to choose?
I'm glad you like it.
You could have them here by daybreak.
Are you proposing to transfer command to me?
I don't know what has happened to Prince Joseph.
That is incredible.
I have just had the most vivid... dream... about Josephine.
Thank you, sir.
You will return to Paris tomorrow and you will carry my compliments and thanks to General Le Clerc for assigning such an excellent officer to carry out a responsibility which has meant so much to myself and to Madame Bonaparte.
At first, it hardly seemed more than a routine fire.
But to start a fire like this in five hours -- how is it possible? It would take a carefully organized plan, tons of combustibles and hundreds of people.
Good heavens, Ambassador -- what has happened?
I believe you issued an order that all citizens of Paris must hand over any weapons that they have in their possession.
No, sir.
Yes, I am, sir.
One must take life as it comes -- do you live in Lyon, sir?
You know I am only too happy to be of help to you, but surely this isn't the ideal moment to involve yourself in such matters.
You can't be serious.  It would not be good to become another husband out of a Moliere farce.
You must not act impetuously.
It is time to clarify the situation. Everything is over between us.
But you can do the same thing in six months.  The next few weeks may be the most important ones in your life.
Are you sure that you are not still in love with her?
Ah, my dear Madame de Montesquiou, you have no idea what happiness it brings me to see this child, at last.  I was told the very idea of such a visit would too much distress the Empress.
Ah, that is good.
May I offer you a drink?
I will never forgive you.
Open the door.  It's me.
What are you doing in there?
Yes.
Why not?
I didn't want to hurt you... All I wanted to do was to keep from hurting you.  I swear I didn't want to hurt you.
About Hippolyte Charles.
Oh, then you are...
And, where did you see my portrait?
Will it be possible to have my dog, Bijou, sent here?  I was not allowed to bring her and I love her so much.
No.
Does she deserve anything better?
England can make no move against you on the Continent without Austria.  A reliable treaty with Austria would end her hopes in that regard.
We have a treaty with Austria.
I am looking for Monsieur George Varlac who resides in the Rue de Frelicot.  Do you know him, monsieur?
Is he alone?
He made friends with a family called Columbier, and would later write of his first flirtation with their daughter, Caroline.
Yo' cousin, Craig.  Hook us up.
Naw, it ain't like that.
Y'all never use it?
Stretch it out.
Where you going?
I ain't trying to rob you...
Yep.  I forgot about him cussin' out everybody.  Damn that was fun.
This you?
That ain't the worst part.  Her little sister, Baby D.  She's the one that gets real physical.  But I got a restraining order on her, too.
I know what 'cha thinking.  I thought the same thing.  But it can't happen.
$247.
You better stop running from that girl.
This vacuum don't work.  Where's the restroom?
You see that?
How you know?  It could be anything.
What's the B-G's?
You're welcome, Unc.
Naw, I'm got live ghetto fabulous.  make sure you get that car fixed.
To the Cucamonga shopping center.
I don't know.
Hello, remember me?
Hell yeah, I remember you.
Easier said than done.  We saved up to get away from them, but they followed us.
I did.  Is that door locked?
That nigga worst than them damn pit bulldogs or something!  That's why moving wit'cha Uncle Elroy and Cousin Day-Day is the best thing for you right now.
Must be your upper lip, 'cause I don't smell nothing.
Craig, this Roach.  Roach, this is my cousin, Craig.
That the big one, huh?
Are they still out there?
I don't know.  I hope Craig got a good idea.  We gotta ask him when he comes out.  Let's go and clean up before Pinky gets here.
Roach...Roach, come on.
Hey.
What?!  What that mean?
Get 'em, Craig!
Finally you got a bitch, huh, Roach?
Hey, guys, I'm outta here.
Thanks for the help.
Call me.
Wet your eyes, boy.  Stay in there for about 20 minutes.
What?!  This look like a 7-11 or something?  Get the fuck outta here!
Get on.
Hey, how you get out of here.
You come way out here to get into more trouble.  You could've stayed at home.
Elroy, what happen?
I threw my back, again.
Uh, yes..
I really don't know. I don't live there. I was just visiting...a grave.
How do you know that?
There's only one way to find out for sure. Try to cancel the last speech.
For not believing you.
Daddy?
What's your point?
Look at your watch. Look at it! At one-thirty your little girl is dead. Say it with me. At one-thirty my little girl is dead. Say it. Say it!
This'11 get you in anywhere.  Red Elevator. Thirty-fifth floor.
Do you now, Mr. Watson?
I talk to her or you can forget about it.
But...
So, come on. You never saw us kiss like that?
Yes, sweetie, it's me.
I promise.
I'm just an accountant.
I have to do something.
Cover your mouth.
Yeah, now listen.  I can't mess with these shoes any more or it's gonna look funny. You go down get yourself something to drink. Make sure Godzilla there, follows you.
Irene is going to help.
Just giving you the gift of a clean windshield. Only cost you a dollar.
For the last time, I don't want it cleaned. Now get the hell out of here!
Goddamnit, you fuckin' bum, come here!
What?
I've done much better ones than this.
A surprise?
Somebody mind telling me... ) What the hell happened!?
You don't want to cause a ruckus, with the little girl and all.
Any trouble?
He was a cool one, that Harper. Never broke.
Think of it, Ben! With that cursed, bloodied gold!
O, she's all right.
Here's your can o' hooks, Uncle Birdie.
You have all sinned!
Yes! Yes!
It's a mighty good man would come out of his way to bring a word of cheer to a grieving widow!
May the Lord have mercy on you, Walt Spoon!
Dear Walt and Icey: I bet you been worried and gave us up for lost. Took the kids down here with me for a visit to my sister Elsie's farm. Thot a little change of scenery would do us all a world of good after so much trubble and heartache. At least the kids will git a plenty of good home cooking. Your devoted Harry Powell
Bluebeard!
The money, Icey.
What!
I tried to save her.
I know you did, Reverend. Oh, I know how you tried!
Want me to take 'em up and wash 'em good?
You, Pearl. You swear too.
Now listen to me, Pearl. You and me is runnin' off tonight.
Won't Daddy Powell take care of us?
I'm hungry, John.
This watch is the nicest watch I ever had.
All right boy: where's the money?
I'll tell you a secret.
You're just foolin'! My name's Pearl.
I'm hungry.
Can I have milk too?
About our secrets.
Ahhh.  And is there -- a doll?
Yes; from the first night.
How's that?
Answer me!
You'll whip me!
He never asked me for nothin'.
Worked like a charm.
So we'll guard her together. Through the night.  In each others' arms like we always said.
M'god, I look twenty years old.  You have any weird dreams last night?
No.
Listen, I got a crazy favor to ask.
You ever read about the Balinese way of dreaming?
What happens if they don't do that?
Hi.
Decide to take a day off after all?
-- I want you to come over here and break the door down exactly twenty minutes from now -- can you do that?
Who? Who did that?
Maybe god's punishing us all...
No television, forget the homework, no phone calls.
Screw sleep!
What's with the bars?
Bunch of us parents tracked him down after they let him go. Found him in an old boiler room, just like before. Saw him lying there in that caked red and yellow sweater he always wore, drunk an' asleep with his weird knives by his side...
Your old man thinks I did it, don't he?
Someone else was there.
No more fights.
They didn't let me. I am in disgrace. Last week at the performance of Carmen I played a sour note. The conductor got so excited he yelled, "There's sabotage in the string section!"
I see.
You want this?
And how is Lord Lavenham?
You must help us, Leon... if you don't win her over we're on our way to Siberia!
Now Comrades, I warn you... if it gets out in Moscow that we stay in the Royal Suite we will get into terrible trouble.
What a lovely room you have here.
How are things in Moscow?
Yes, Comrade?
Good old Razinin! Is he still alive? How does he manage?
Blue? Let's offset his mood. Find a striped one, and brighten it with a great blaze of tie.
Well, sir, if you should do it again, which I hope you won't, please remember the order. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet.
We don't blame you, Leon, but when we came from Russia we believed in simplicity...
Ninotchka, we are in the magic East, the country of Aladdin and His Lamp...
Well, gentlemen... how about a little lunch?
Get out of here!
Razinin.
You found your way to us and we weren't easy to reach, were we?
I am looking for Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.
Comrade.
All right, then make an appointment with her so I can see her!
Sssh! Once and for all, we're in Moscow!
Yes, a good piece of apfel strudel....
Why should an aristocrat want to go to Russia?
There is no privacy in Russia. This whole thing seems very suspicious. What's the real reason? If you ever want to get into Russia, take my advice... confess!
You're going to force us... huh?
How do I know you don't want to blow up a factory?
How many minutes between the first and second whistle?
Have I? Do you know when I come to think about it it's staggering. If I add it all up I must have spent years waiting for signals. Imagine! An important part of my life wasted between whistles.
I have heard of the arrogant male in capitalistic society. It is having a superior earning power that makes you like that.
That's a strange angle.
Do not misunderstand me. I do not hold your frivolity against you.  As basic material you might not be bad, but you are the unfortunate product of a doomed culture. I feel sorry for you.
What a city! There are the Grands Boulevards... blasted out of the heart of the old streets. The Arc de Triomphe... made to greet Napoleon's army. The Opera! And Montmartre... Montparnasse... La BohÃ¨me... and now I'll show you the greatest attraction!  It will cost me a franc but it is worth it.  The most wonderful spot in all Paris -- unique! Here, look....  What do you see?
We take off our hat and coat.  We sit down -- we make ourselves comfortable. We adjust ourselves to the prospect of a most enjoyable evening. We look at each other. We smile.  Well... we don't smile. How about some music?
Thank you. Thank you.
I was wounded before Warsaw.
A Polish lancer. I was sixteen.
Just what you see. A tiny cog in the great wheel of evolution.
It's midnight. One half of Paris is making love to the other half. Look at the clock. One hand has met the other hand. They kiss. Isn't that wonderful?
Oh, let it ring.
Then do it through my lawyer!
Room service speaking.
I didn't follow you.
Then how did you get here?
What are you after?
Oh, Ninotchka, who wants to talk business. If you win the suit, fine. If we win the suit, better. You do me an injustice.  When we went to my apartment did I have the slightest idea that you had any connection with this deal?
That's not a laugh! I mean a laugh from the heart. Now let's see. I'm going to tell you a funny story. Just a moment... I've got it! Well, it seems there were a couple of Frenchmen who went to America...
You remember this room?
Well, first I should like to take off my hat and jacket.  Then could we have some music?
She is very attractive. She has great elegance.  She's what you call a woman of the world, isn't she?
Wonderful -- if one could believe it.
You must, darling.
But, darling, you can't do that.
Not white, darling.
Right: Lovers of the world unite!
I have paid the penalty. Now let's have some music.
What shall we get? The news!
No, no news. We don't want to know what's happening in the world. We want to be left alone, don't we?
Czar Peter gave it to his wife, Catherine the Great. For it he sold ten thousand serfs in the market.
It is their wish.
They wouldn't let me in so I had to get you out.
Trying to keep me away from you! It couldn't be done. Naturally I couldn't go on forever punching passport officials in the nose -- but I found a way, didn't I? Darling, I had to see you. I wrote and wrote but all my letters came back.
Your conversation has one marvelous advantage, Swana. However many questions you ask you never expect an answer.
Don't you find that restful?... Why didn't you come last night?
What a gruesome proof of the power of the press!
A couple of bloodhounds and we have Uncle Tom's Cabin.
Leon! What in heaven's name...!
No.
I just couldn't sleep. I got up and went back... and then got up again. These last few days... whew!
Now... here we have two very handsome soft-boiled eggs. Do you suppose hens mind what happens to their eggs? Probably not. They have such unfeeling eyes. We'll put in a great nugget of butter, plenty of pepper and salt... Darling, I haven't seen you for three livelong days... seventy-two hours!
Thank you.
I've some wonderful news for you, Leon. It's about Punchy... do you mind if I sit down?
Did I act stupidly last night? Should I apologize?
Leon! This has the ugly sound of regeneration.
Not at all.... I understand perfectly, Count d'Algout gave you a dog. You made it very clear, madame.
Isn't it amazing! One gets a wrong impression of the new Russia.  It must be charming. I'm glad conditions are so improved. I assume this is what the factory workers wear at their dances?
Good morning.
I must ask you to leave.
Madame, if you...
Where are they?
You leave me no choice.
Now, let's free ourselves from emotionalism and try to solve the problem in a practical way. Our situation has changed considerably. Before I had only a claim to the jewels. Now I have the jewels.
Under Soviet law the jewels belong to the State. France is going to uphold that ownership.
Yes.
Thank you.
May I ask what has happened?
No, madame, something of the utmost importance... it concerns your jewels.
For Christ's sake, it soils my mother's memory.  Do you think I want the whole goddamn world to see my mother like this?  Raising a dirty mouth!
Uh, I would say these people are going to cost a million dollars over the next two years ...
You say, John, cut our losses and all the rest.  But suppose the thing blows and they indict Bob and the others. Jesus, you'd never recover from that, John.  It's better to fight it out instead, and not let people testify ...
Who's gonna tell Mitchell?
How so?
They went after Castro.  In some crazy way it got turned on Kennedy.  I don't think the "P" knows what happened, but he's afraid to find out.  It's got him shitting peach pits.
I like it.  I like the idea.
Where's Hunt now?
I don't know, I don't know ... I just know we've made too many enemies.
Sir, Bob and I are gonna have to testify before Earvin's committee.
You're all set, sir.  Just push this button.  Good night, Mr. President.
This could trigger the impeachment. They'll go to the Supreme Court next.
Congress is considering four articles of impeachment, sir.
"Victory at Sea," Al ... Henry.  The Pacific Theatre.  Christ, you can almost feel the waves breaking over the decks.
The army?
Lincoln used it.
That's right ...
... you mentioned the "Bay of Pigs" several times.  Sooner or later they're going to want to know what that means.  They're going to want to know what was on that gap ...
It was just a fishing expedition. Apparently it was their fourth attempt at the DNC.
Well, why not?
Silence!
Should we talk to Trini about paying these guys?  Or maybe Chotiner?
The only problem with that, sir -- it gets us into obstruction of justice.
What?  That he knew Johnny Roselli? Hoover knew a lot of gangsters.
So?  You wanted Castro dead. Everybody wanted Castro dead.  If Hunt and the others are CIA, why don't we just throw this back in the CIA's lap? Let Richard Helms take the fall?
... he'd just found out about Track 2.
Money.  Follow the money.
Sir?
Get that little fucker!  Great tackle! Reminds me of my days at Whittier. Most of these kids are useless.
Sir?
Congratulations, boss.  A great victory!  The madman theory wasn't so crazy after all.
... beating out the other papers, chasing girls ...
We've got to turn the faucet off on this thing.  It's out of control ...  You might burden just me with this in the future.
What about the documents he promised?
More light, chief?
It's a gift, Richard.  This law school is a gift from your brother.
What do you think?  He said in life there's no free ride.
Oh, no, Harold.  He doesn't respond well to humor.  Maybe if you talk to Mother she can ...
I'm honored, Dick, that you've come all this way out here to Virginia to visit us at last.
I promised the American people peace with honor in Southeast Asia.  That could take time -- two, maybe three years ... In the meantime, your agency will continue at current levels of funding.
And me? ...
Well, we'll lodge a formal protest.
Oh, my goodness ...
I never met the man.
You asked if you could count on my support ... As long as I can count on yours.
I know for a fact that the one with the big tits is a Republican, and she'd do anything for the Party.
Mr. President, we are in a revolutionary situation.  We are under siege -- Black Panthers, Weathermen; The State Department under Rogers is leaking like a sieve.  And now this insignificant little shit Ellsberg publishing all the diplomatic secrets of this country will destroy our ability to conduct foreign policy.
Alright, Henry -- we're gonna go your way.  Crush this Ellsberg character the same way we did Hiss!
That's right!  And if necessary, I'll drop the big one.
... Uh, I hope this doesn't embarrass you.
Just ... uh ... you know.
Do you miss Cuba, Manolo?
Yes, Mr. President.
We let you down, didn't we.  Your people.
Hiss was protecting his wife.  I've always believed that.
My brother Harold was about the same age as those kids, John.  Tuberculosis got him.
They were throwing rocks, John, just rocks.  They don't think I feel ... but I feel too much sometimes.  I just can't let a whole policy get dominated by our sentimentality.
... Somebody should shoot the little bastard.
Ernie Davis.
That's Julie ... and that's Tricia. She, uh, reminds me a little bit of you ...
Sir?
No, sir ...
And this?!  Good Lord, have you lost your mind?  Nixon can't say this. "Niggers"!
It is.  We know that.  And it's enough that we know.  Just think of the girls.  They're still young.  We never see them.  I lost my parents.  I don't want them to lose theirs; I don't want them to grow up without a mother and father ...
Maybe I should get out of the game. What do you think, Buddy?  Go back to being a lawyer and end up with something solid, some money at the end of the line ... You know, I keep thinking of my old man tonight.  He was a failure, too.
What are you saying?  What are you talking about?
Dick, you should call Bobby.
No.  It's his way.  He hates me.  Him and Teddy.  They always hated me.
Buddy? ...
I don't want them to love me.
I do.  I do.  In my own way.
I wish I knew.  You're hiding.
No, it isn't.  I won't interfere with you anymore.  I'm finished trying.
No ... it's just going to start now ...  If I could just ... If I could just ... sleep.
Yes, you've circled round.
No ID in her room?
...I don't know what I do feel like.
I wish I could say that was in his favor. But I have to say I don't think it is.
You wouldn't think a car would burn like that.
Yes, appears to have been a glitch or two.
Sir, I don't want to picture that.
Okay.
I can't plan your day.
...You got no cause to hurt me.
No. But I gave my word.
Not like that. Not like you say.
No. I found it.
Llewelyn.
Yeah.
Well thanks for fallin' all over and apologizing.
Yes I do.
Well I got  a good one. So they ought to even out. Quit worrying about everthing.
Llewelyn?
What did I know to tell him. You're hurt, ain't you?
What's that.
Where does he work?
Llewelyn?! No he ain't.
All right.
Sixty-nine cent.
I didn't mean nothin' by it.
You don't know what you're talking about, do you?
I could come back then.
Well... I need to close now --
You live in that house behind the store?
We lived in Temple Texas for many years. Raised a family there. In Temple. We come out here about four years ago.
Sir?
I didn't put nothin' up.
Yes you did. You been putting it up your whole life. You just didn't know it. You know what date is on this coin?
No.
...Don't put it in your pocket.
Good. I need everything else.
We got a loose cannon here. And we're out a bunch of money, and the other party is out his product.
Well enough.
What do you want to know?
...What do you do?
Acetylene? Mig? Tig?
I thought you said the eggs weren't...
You should get the order you want.
Who eats eggs for lunch, anyhow?
Good God... they're meat eaters, Roy, just drop the shit in there!
No, Elden, I need to...
Did you send anyone out there?
You said a woman couldn't have done it.
Oh, you're sharp as a tack, Elden.
One question, Doctor, please!  You can't do this! I'm the press, I have rights!!
That's bullshit, Sheriff! You think she's a suspect!
What the hell do you want?... Hey, Sue Ann, what's up?
Elden, let me out of here. Now! This is ridiculous, I need medical attention!
Oh. How come?
Oh, yeah, he's got things up and running, alright...
I better go check on them.
Ahh, it's too late, anyway. It's too late.  Listen, I could shoot my way out, maybe take one of them with me... If you'd gimme my gun back.
Wesley didn't even want to come up here. He warned me, but I insisted...  I have to ask you, Betty...are you crazy?
I'll give you a hint. If you scrunch up your eyes a bit it looks just like a Jaguar...
Honey, I'm really sorry, I was gonna call you about tonight. Larry's got a lodge meeting. There's no way I can get a sitter this fast.
All the time...
Yeah, hon. Real bad. You just get some sleep, everything's gonna be fine.
I gotta go.
Oh, you mean Fred.
There was no plan! I was just young and stupid and scared!
Yes, she is.
Of course.
Yeah, I felt that way, too, when I first started, but now... the hours, the repetition... it's not all glamour and mall openings anymore. Maybe I should've listened to my people and tried to make the crossover to nights earlier, I don't know...  ...I just hope it's not too late for me. God! Listen to me, "Me, me, me." It's so easy to get caught up in the whole ego cycle of this business and make it all about yourself. Stop, right? That's it, no more about me tonight, I promise... Let's talk about you... what do you think about me? I'm kidding... Seriously, Betty, I'm doing all the talking here...
...but I love listening to you, so that's okay...
Thanks. But I'd like to hear what you're feeling...
Your lines are in the script, but you can ad lib.
I took the blue Corsica, Del. Relax.
You're not on that soap opera thing again, are you? 'Cause you know what that is?
I don't know.
Hi, Betty. You're looking good...
Hey, Betty. Are you okay?
I'm great, good, content.  What happened to your arm, Roy?
No. Loma Vista.
Ellen, this is the biggest thing I've ever done, but I've gotta do it.
I'm massaging his heart. I saw it done once.
You made it! Hey, that looks great on you. 'S classy...  So, how'd it go today? You find him?
You know, the more I think about it, this really isn't David's kind of place.
He has a wife?!
Had. She died in a car accident last year. She was decapitated.
Fuck the details, they're always to blame... Look, too many of these guys duck out on us, especially after they become doctors or lawyers. I see it at my company all day long! So I'm just gonna make sure you get your, you know, fairy tale ending or whatever...  One of us should.
I helped you because I'm an idiot! Ask my mother, I love it when people take advantage of me! I TRUSTED YOU!! I THOUGHT HE WAS REAL!
No, I'm not sure I could begin to imagine... So, where'd you go?
You should have a little faith in people.
Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients, the hospital?
What are you doing?
You think I'm crazy, Rosa, but you don't know the half of it. My husband was, ahh...
Lonnie, it's a complex procedure. Why don't you observe?
How do you do, Mr. McCord. We're trying to locate a deranged fan of yours,... a Ms. Betty...
It's a nice place you got here. Real comfortable. Sweet little town, Fair Oaks. You like it here?
What do you mean?
Of what?
The Indians, Injuns, whatever. They're always drunk and doing stupid things.
Relax, we brought the cash.
Why not, it'll confuse 'em... gotta do something, now that you fucked it up.
I wanted to make a statement.
Worse... you're in Texas.
How'd they describe her?
We don't have time to look at a hole in the ground. We can make Vegas in four hours. This one's got to be her.
"When I grow up I'm going to become a nurse or a veterinarian. I always want to help people and value all life, be it animal, plant or mineral..."  Does that sound like a goddamn showgirl to you?
No, no, Betty came here strictly for business, 'cause it's the biggest market for what she's selling. I should have known it all along. I'm kicking myself as I shave here. So, first thing we...
It just didn't fit her profile...
We could do that. I could be on my way to Florida, and you could go to Thailand and fuck your brains out.
Really?
Okay, uh... the, umm, Injuns're stupid.
I don't think she can do it. You saw what happened.
Uh-huh.
Hey, can you sneak me on the lot?
...why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill somebody?
Nothin' complex about it. Del's dead, Betty's gone. She's probably dead, too.
No, about... Are you talking about Duane Cooley?
Betty. It's O.K. except I'm worn out. We spent all weekend looking for her doctor-boy. How can a big time heart guy leave no trace of himself?
I see.  Did Chloe testify?
Yeah?
Mr. Campbell?
What do we do now, Everett?
Preacher said my sins are warshed away, including that Piggly Wiggly I knocked over in Yazoo!
Baptism. You two are just dumber'n a bag of hammers. Well, I guess you're my cross to bear-
I just don't think it's right, keepin' him under wraps like we's ashamed of him.
Well, uh, I - I gotta get the family farm back before I can start thinkin' about that.
A miracle! It was a miracle!
We ain't gettin' married with his ring!  You said you'd changed!
That's right, honey.
You said it was in the rolltop desk!
You -
Uh-huh.
You didn't know that at the time!
Well, I'll be a sonofabitch. Delmar's been saved!
It's awful white of ya to take it like that, Everett. I feel wretched, spoilin' yer play for a million dollars'n point two. It's been eatin' at my guts.
Pete, uh, I don't want ya to beat yourself up about this thing...
Fact of the matter - there never was!
...No treasure... I had two weeks left on my sentence...
Soggy Bottom Boys - I don't precisely recollect, uh -
It was a powerful air.
Mama said you was hit by a train!
You afraid you'll have to salute me, Chief?
Hey, what did you want? A lot of fatherly bullshit? A big pat on the back?
Don't lose any sleep over it. I wouldn't mind being the first woman to fly a jet fighter in combat.
Ever heard of knocking, mayo?
Subic Bay, sir. In the Philippines.
No way, Mayo. You don't give a shit about anybody but yourself and every single one of your classmates knows it. Think they'd trust you behind the controls of a plane they have to fly in? Hey, man, I figure you for the kind of guy who'd zip off one day in my F-14 and sell it to the Cubans.
No, sir!
Yes, sir!
What did you call me?
Whatever you say, Mayonnaise.
Yes, sir!
He was. He died.
I'm a little late, that's all.
That was you guys, huh?
Well, it you're not gonna ask, then I will. How was it?
Details, Pokrif. From what I saw he had an incredible body.
That don't justify trying to trap a boy by getting pregnant, Lynette! Nothing justifies that. I can't believe you're even thinking like that. I mean, that's really backward.
Lynette, where's Sid?
That there isn't one, as of today. I had my period.  I couldn't believe it. He still wanted to marry me.
Really?
Who knows? Guys a lot smarter than me are dropping out like flies.
Who cares?  Mmmm. Now I remember. Mayo the Wop. Gee, I'm glad you're here. I've been looking forward to this all week.
I vote for the motel.
I shouldn't have done that. I should've walked.
Zack, I dare you not to fall in love with me. I ain't gonna get serious with you, no way. But how can you resist me? I'm like candy.
Want me to get a towel?
That's no excuse for not going after what you want.
Come on. Invite me. All day the idea of a family Sunday dinner's been coming into my head. Since you're the only one I know around here with family...
I'm so embarrassed. I knew I shouldn't have brought you here.
No, it's okay. It was a great free meal. Everybody was so uptight I felt sorry for you.
Your real father was an Officer candidate like me?
Twenty-two years ago.
Hey! You know goddamn well what happened so let's not play any games, okay?
Please stop it. None of that's true. Goddamnit, I love you. I loved you ever since I met you.
How about that prick! He told me he wasn't officer material because he grew up poor like me.
That Foley looks like he's been through a war or two.
Think there's any truth to what he was saying about those girls? Is that still going on?
That isn't true, is it?
I don't believe that. They're just having a good time, same as us.
My girl back home. We're supposed to get married after I get my wings. She was Tommy's girl. They were engaged to be married before he died.  I should've told you about her. I don't know why I didn't, except I didn't want you to think I was a shit for making it with Lynette.
But she expects you to marry her?
I have the gun.
Okay, okay!  Okay.
Yeah, just like a half hour, maybe a little more, and your mom'll give it to you.  You can wait a half hour, can't you?
She's fuckin' crazy, she killed the kid!  She just killed her own kid!
She's gonna handle it.
They're not supposed to be here!
Unless Daddy comes back later.
I'm afraid to let you think, Junior. Things get worse when you think.  Oh, that's gonna help.
Open it.
Do me a favor and don't talk.
'Bout four o'clock.
I don't have to tell you there is an acute shortage of living space in Manhattan right now and this is a highly unique property.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.  We can still handle this.  Can we still handle this?
What do they want?
Chills?
Fuck.
YOU HAVE TO!
Morse code?
Dot dot dot, dash dash dash, dot dot dot.
Got him!
If it looks like I can't get back, just close the door.
Blue is phones?
Call Dad!
What would you think, in the middle of the night?  I mean, three what, three bears?  He'll call the police.
I'm sorry.
Where is the Glucogen?
Hey, quit apologizing, you're starting to sound like Grandma. You're not gonna have an attack. Okay?
What do you mean? We're black ain't we? And we care about improving the plight of out people don't we? Or you figure oppression stops at that thing dangling between your legs!
No...
What are you doing with the gun?
Free? We're back where we started. Shit we still don't have a stop light.
Hold up a second... We got a decision to make.
I don't know you and I got nothing to say to you.
Shit man. It was... you know spontaneous.
Judge, hold on, is your phone safe?
God damn... Kid never had a chance...
Sabu, what the fuck you doing? Ain't nobody gonna push on this street.
I ain't gonna tell you no more. No pushing in the neighborhood, especially not on my fucking street. You're killing your own people asshole.
To be quite honest it turns my stomach.
We need money first...
So talk...
Alone...
Get the brothers a beer. Me too while you're at it.  Men? Well we can spare six for security...
You know, you're lucky to be back. Most niggers die on the front lines. Seems like that's what they're there for.
Whatever you need, I'll be there.
You were alright Judge, better than alright. You're what the Party needs. A fighter but also one that's going to school not making the man too nervous.
Aw... uh... it's was just harassment. My driver's license expired.
What's the pig's name?
Yeah.
And you're gonna do just that. But I'll tell you what to feed the pig. You alright with this?
If the pigs only knew they were subsidizing The Panthers...
I thought you said all the Panthers were gonna be here.
You're a smart brother... you should dig what Huey and Bobby got to say...
Fuck is up?!
Motherfuckers...
What?
Where is he?.
Why didn't you tell me?
Do you think Frances with an "e" is too manly a name for a girl?
When?
I know who you are, Gabriel Marion. The last time I saw you, I was nine and you put ink in my tea.
Well?
Cheerful news to greet the morn.
How did this... how did I let this happen?
Goodbye, Charlotte.
What unit?
We did.
Please accept my apology for not having done so sooner.
I consider them linked.
I beg to differ.  One is a command decision on your part.  The other represents nothing more than the occasional over-exuberance of field officers attempting to carry out their duty in difficult circumstances.
And if I triumph, you triumph.
Father, a post rider came from Charleston.  You have a letter inside.
The New York and Rhode Island assemblies have been dissolved...
Yes.  He seeks a levy of troops and money.
We'd cover more ground if we split up.
I've been doing this for two years. I'm the best scout in the Continental Army, the best horseman, the best shot, the best scavenger and I know every deer path and swamp trail between here and Charleston.
And, Corporal...  ... be careful.
You know how old I am.
Father?
She spoke?  Susan spoke?
Everyone knows.  It's what made me a hero.  Me, Harry Lee, all of us.  I got a medal.  Men bought me drinks. They still do sometimes.  Everyone knows what happened.
A long time ago...
We don't have to go to war to gain independence...
Royal petition, delegates to court, judicial redress, economic boycott, bribery...
There's nothing you could have done, Gates is a damned fool.
We saw.
The bigger problem is where, not when.  The French fleet won't sail north of the Chesapeake for fear of early storms.
How many men have we seen die?
Two.  Gabriel and Thomas.
Goodbye, Francis.
I was sorry to hear about your son.
Father, I saw a post rider at the house.
They do it to honor the dead, Ellen.
Paxcow says Daddy's going to do something really bad. He--
Hurrts! It hurrrrts!
Good God! Where'd you hear that?
I'm not tired!
Come with us, daddy. Please come with us!
Hey--they actually found the place!
Bagged cat. What a mess.
But--
No. We won't. I have climbed it a time or two before, and I know all the places to step. Just follow me...move easy...don't look down...and don't stop. If you stop, you'll crash through for sure.
I guess so...but...
I tried to tell myself I buried him alive. You know--Edgar Allan Poe meets Felix the Cat. But...
You're thinking of things best not thought of, Louis.
Because something called a wendigo soured the ground.
I want to wake up. I want to wake up, that's all. I--
Let her go. It's cool.
That's forgotten.
You better get going, hon.
I told you last night--this can be the start of patching things up with your folks. If something good doesn't come of Gage's death, I think I'll go crazy.
What's in your head, boy?
She.  Goes.  Free.
We got that part.  Anything else?
Just so you know, Jack -- I don't think you're that clever.  I think you're a fool.  A mortal fool.
Turner blood doesn't flow pure in his veins.  Best play it safe, and spill it all.
Then why aren't you eating?
I can't believe he would make such a sacrifice for us.
Miss Swann.
You?!
Drink up me hearties, yo ho ...
Well, perhaps ... with a bit more to drink, I might ...
Jack, it must be so terrible for you, to be trapped here on this island, all over again.
You -- you burned up the island, for a one-time chance at being spotted?
Jack, it's a fool's errand: You've heard the tales they tell about the Pearl.
What's in your head to put you in such a fine mood?
What?  He never told me that.
You understand this ship cannot be crewed by only two men.  You'll never make it out of the bay.
Sir, I'll not see any of my men killed or wounded in this foolish enterprise.
Some sort of to-do up at the fort, eh?  You two weren't invited?
None?  Very well.  You rumbled me. I confess: I intend to commandeer one of these ships, pick up a crew in Tortuga, and go on the account, do a little honest pirating.
Norrington, think about it ... the Black Pearl, its captain and crew ... the last pirate threat in the Caribbean.  How can you pass that up?
Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid of.
I'd die for her.
For a man whose made an industry of avoiding boats, you're a quick study.
Jack!
Well, you're the worst pirate I've ever heard of.  You're a man who can be trusted, who can be counted on, and who can't betray his friends.  What kind of pirate is that?
The Black Pearl is a real ship.
Yes.
He's still breathing.
Well, she had a very taxing day... Ghastly weather tonight.
Commodore --
What are you going to do to him?
Yes, that's true.  We have to find him, run tests, determine if the polymerization is stable.
Why are there two ottomans?
Where did he go?
I just want to know what goes on in the mind of a litterbug.  What chemical is secreted by your smooth brain that tells you, 'It's okay, just chuck it'?
Look, asshole, I don't got time for this.  If you got a problem, you better take care of it yourself.
A man?
Nigel, can't you see he's using you?
Like Crazy Glue?
Is that so?
It already is.
Well, it was good to see you, Daniel, but I have to be going.
And what I love about molecular science is the way it revolutionizes how we have to think.  It unifies the entire world on a single level. Everything is completely connected. Sometimes I can really feel it, everything around us, just a small part of a whole.  It's really wonderful.
You're insane.
Daniel!
Pills... you know how I feel about pills.
The problem is the by-product created by the process.
What do these replicators do to people?
Oh yeah, real funny.  Yuk-yuk. Let's laugh at everything a man believes in.
Blame the victim.
What's that?
We've got to get the nanobot.
It's too late.  Argon injected it.
I have to!
What?  I'm not going anywhere!
Mrs. Argon?  It's Sim.
Thank you. I'll go and look for her at once. Goodbye, Mrs. Smith.
I'm not interested in your literary recommendations.
Will - uh - five thousand be enough?
I'm just beginning to believe that something could be done with you.
My name is Smith - well, that you seem to have been able to stand for the last month. I'm white, male and over twenty-one. I've never been in jail - that is, not often. And I prefer Scotch to Bourbon. I hate carrots, I hate peas, I like black coffee and I hate garters. I make seventy-five bucks a week and I've got eight hundred and forty-seven bucks in the bank - and - I don't know yet whether your eyes are blue or violet.
Never mind my nose. What kind of a chump do you think I am? You think I'm going to live here in your house - on your dough?  What do you think my friends would all say? Don't be silly. I'd get the razzing of my life for that. 'A bird in a gilded cage' - that's what I'd be. Not me. Oh no, not me!
Got my initials on them too. They're cute. They're nice little things - what do you do with them?
Didn't I? That's funny. Isn't it funny?
Are you crazy?
Oh, they're all right, Anne. But Iâ€
Oh hello, Anneâ€ He types furiously.
This is something I should have done a long time ago, only I didn't have sense enough to do it. No, I had to stick around here to try and make a success of something that I knew darn well was a failure from the very beginning. But no more. No more! So that's that.
Thank you very much.
Yeah?
It's all right. You can write your own ticket. A hundred and fifty bucks a week.
Now listen, we've got a tip that the Schuyler family has finally made a deal with that chorus dame.
Gallagher and myself just came over here to do a little work on a story -
â€”Mr. Schuyler .
Is that so?
Just a boid in a gilded cage -
Sure.
I'm not quitting!
Thank you, thank you, thank you! I'll do that for you some time. That's very sweet. Say listen, what did you say your name was?
I think I understand, sir. You mean you want me to go?
That's a canary! Who brought that in here? Canary, huh? Go on, get that out of here. Get that out of here!
Yes, of course. Miss Ramsey telephoned me. Well, what would you like to have?
He's probably very tired. You see, he's had to meet all these people personally tonight.
I bet.
Sure, you ran away. Aren't you going to congratulate a guy?
Well, daughter of the slums - how did you get out of the ghetto?
Staring at us?
No, no. Strange, I've never seen Anne act that way before.  It's funny I never thought to tell her you were a girl, isn't it?
Yeah?
How about my breakfast? How do you expect me to ring a curtain down on an empty stomach?
What other girlâ€?
Rumors? Rumors? Since when is a breach-of-promise case a rumor?
Well, well. That takes it out of the rumor class, doesn't it?
I think you'd better go.
Well, at best you might deny it.
Traps shut!
Surely, sit down. If I had known you were coming, I would have thrown you up a waffle.
Listen Grayson, I've got 106 bucks and 75 cents in the bank. Now Anne can have any part of that she wants, but she'd better hurry because I'm spending it awfully fast.
Wait a minute. Do I get from you that she wants to pay me alimony?
Sure.
I sort of invited him along to bend an elbow. You don't mind, do you?
What is it, Smythe?
About what? Your marriage to Anne!
That's the fourteenth crack you've made to me. I'm keeping count. When you get to twenty, I'm gonna sock you right on the nose. As a matter of fact, I ought to sock you right now.
Now, now Jeeves.[5] Was that nice? Was that being a gentleman, Jeeves? Was it, Jeeves? Your name is Jeeves, isn't it?
But Iâ€
Did you call, sir?
Yes, sir.
No! Well, well, well! That's all right, if you like it. Can anybody do that?
Oh no, sir. Some people are natural putterers. Others can never master it.
Yes sir.
A bird in a gilded cage?
Actually--I'm not real ... hungry.
Can I ask you a question?
... Sex.
Does it look okay?
I'm so proud of you, Bud.
Having kind of a tough time.
Bud brought it to me.
Isn't it great how she's resting like that?
But I really should get home.
Like a drum.
All night?
Look at me George. That meeting's not for me. Look at my face.
I don't know if I ever said this to you before, but, well ... I think you're just about the keenest girl in the whole school ...
Well, sometimes talking's over-rated. Don't you think?
To be honest Mary Sue. I didn't think you'd want to come here until we'd been pinned for a little while.
What'll it be?
Betty's making some pineapple kabobs ...
Rain.
Do you know that it's illegal?
Okay--that's enough!
Um ... I don't know how to do that, Bob.
Green.
What happened?
What's going to happen?
We don't have a choice Jen. We're stuck until he comes back.
Who's that?
It's too weird David. This place is giving me the creeps. Did you know all the books are blank?
I looked in the library. They got covers with nothing inside them.
I like--really need a cigarette, too.
You can't do this, Jennifer. I WARNED you.
They don't have that kind of potential.
Okay look, this like--wasn't my fault. They asked me what it was about and I like didn't remember 'cause we had it back in tenth grade, But I told them what I DID remember, and the next thing I knew the pages had filled in.
The pages filled in?
Nothing.
Are you sure?
And you're sure about this?
Sure ... Where would we go?
How?
Well it's louder ... And scarier I guess ... And ... and a lot more dangerous ...
Yeah.
Yeah ... Sort of ...
... Her father.
McIntire's.
Maybe in a day or so when I'm not so emotional ...
Bud--I thought you wanted to come home.
Because you're coming home. I'm gonna put this place back the way it was.
EXCUSE ME?
I'm going to leave now.
Hope you're proud of yourself.
I don't know ... Three, four weeks.
What's wrong?
You know, if this ever happens again, you can make the fries even if I haven't put out the napkins yet.
Look. I thought we talked about this, I thought we said ...
Look, you can't always like what you do. Sometimes you just do it because it's your job. And even if you don't like it, you just gotta do it anyway.
You know what I really like?
TV repair.
Oh GOD ...
So you watching Pearl Jam on MTV tonight?
I'm just working....I have some customers here.....
Fine. You get back to chatting with your precious customers.
Did you think that we'd all be looking at you?
She's my friend and you should meet her. You'd like her.
...please, I just don't want it....
....wait a minute: why is this about you now? Why is it always about you?
Well, yeah, thank you, but --
You're lucky. She couldn't come anyway --
I have work, I can't leave.
-- do you think you'll ask her out?
I'll leave then, I'll go to get something from my car, go away so you don't feel pressure. Can I ask you a serious question:
I....please don't do this.
-- what are you talking about, come on --
Nothing.
No.
No, I mean, what city, what state are you in?
What do you mean it doesn't matter?
Yes.
This is really weird and really embarrassing for me but....uh....  I was wondering if you could help me out with a little bit of money.
I can't really. Yeah, no. I mean. I can't afford it.
You don't even know how much it is.
So you think you can?
Should I call back and talk to your girlfriend?
Why did you tell me you did, then?
This is not cool.
Ok. Maybe I'll see you later. Thank you for your help.
I'm sorry I couldn't come to your sister's birthday party last night, Elizabeth had invited me and I couldn't make it --
-- well, if you're gonna go --
Ok.
....Hi.....
That's very nice. Thank you. Thank you for saying that.  You're friends with my sister?
You like her?
Yeah?
-- the promotion says: buy any 10 Healthy Choice products and get 500 miles of airline travel or 1,000 for purchases made with a special coupon. So in the supermarket, you notice their products, first you notice they have a Teriyaki Chicken Dinner at $1.79 - that's a pretty good deal....but then I noticed they had soup at 89 cents a can.....and you start to do the math and you start to notice that it's a really amazing deal because I stumbled across the pudding at 25 cents a cup. Now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label. That's those little bar codes, you know? The universal product codes?
Yeah.
....No....
I'm sorry. I thought you said --
There's a better place for us to eat.
Well, it's fine. Thank you.
Hi.
I don't freak out.
Hello?
I just wanted to make sure.
Where you married?
Where do you have to go?
For work.....
I think maybe over a hundred.
I forgot about that.
You left me at the hospital.
You can't do that.
If you wanted to call me back I could...
On my knife.
Yeah, but I didn't do anything.
Please don't do this to me.
-- it's $2.99 per minute for the first half hour and $1.99 per minute after that.
That's that.
I know that. Maybe you know other doctors?
How am I supposed to know what to do if you don't say it -- if it's not in your rules and regulations in your fine print how am I supposed to know how to be with this --
It takes time to process --
That's part of a very interesting airline promotion giveaway that's really tremendous. I'm going to start a collection of pudding and coupons that can be redeemed for frequent flyer miles through Healthy Choice and American Airlines --
You're goin' on a trip?
You know you can get places in the world with pudding. That's funny.
Hi.
I need to talk to you for a second.
It's three hundred and twenty dollars, just take it.
You have an ATM?
HEY. You made a fucking sex call and now you're gonna pay. It's not a big thing -- just give us some money and then it's over -- we'll just walk down to the ATM and get your money out --
I'm serious.
You can't just not show up like you do, you have to go.
I don't really remember that.
Are you ready?
Ok. What should I do about Eric?
Well...he's not that strange, don't say that.
I was wrong to free him, but so are you -- for taking all his treasures -- his quills and his ink --
Ow!
Charenton has changed; it's not safe for you here.
Mustn't do that, sir.
What the devil --
That monstrous God of yours? He strung up his very own son like a side of veal; I shudder to think what He'd do to me.
Virgin birth -- ha! An entire religion, built on an oxymoron!
-- water! --
Oh, but you must, my pumpkin! Sex without flirtation is merely rape!
It's a potent aphrodisiac, isn't it? Power over another man.
Oh, I'm to be blamed now, am I?
I saw the longing in your eye --
I'm here.
You're a man of Science; I'm a man of God. Charenton stands to profit from us both, I'm certain.
He no longer roars or spits. He no longer taunts the guards or molests his fellow wards --
It's essential to his recovery; a purgative for the toxins in his mind.
It was not inspired by circumstance.
That's not our intent --
I'm afraid so; he's an idealist. You'll have to be politic.
I'll be waiting.
My darling, Eugenie, dainty morsel! Get on your back! Let's try it dorsal!
"A habituÃ¨ of cemeteries, his proudest conquest was a maid six decades his senior, deceased a dozen years."
I'm hungry for a proper visit.
Don't start --
The peril of composing such incendiary prose...
The unhappy tale of a virginal laundry lass, the darling of the lower wards, where they entomb the criminally insane.
Most assuredly.
What have they done to you now?
...yes, I've got that bit...
It is customary to write first, and request an appointment --
I pay his stipend every month, far more dutifully than I should.
Good God, Marquise --
If only you'd remained true to our contract! Opiates, for his nerves! Restraints! The man warrants a bed of nails --
You've come to lecture me?
They've put you up to this, haven't they?
Doesn't that please you?
It's gonna be fine, Orson. You're gonna do great.
Who are you, sir?
I wonder. Do you have any idea what you have done?
Randolph!
Mm. Not a very good picture I am told.
Why is that, Louis?
See what you can do about this CITIZEN KANE picture, won't you?
There's no call for that language-
How does one get 125 million dollars in debt?
There's nothing to explain
There is nothing to discuss-
Did you need it? Did you need any of it?
Tough shit. We need to t-t-talk about this--
Fuck you, Mr. Kane.
I will not have this in my home.
Thank you for your time
Sir? 
Sir?
"Well, if you got drunk to talk to me about Miss Alexander, don't bother. I'm not interested. I've set back the sacred cause of reform, is that it? All right, if that's the way they want it, the people have made their choice. It's obvious the people prefer Jim Gettys to me."
I can't remember the lines!
love them so much that they ought to love you back. Only you want love on your own terms. "
He personally asked you to?
What are movies about, Orson?
Nope.
Showing life
That's better than being the oldest has-been in Hollywood history.
Jesus
Image a man that has shaped his time. A titanic figure of limitless influence. Think about empire. A man with an empire at his feet. A man, like a baron, living in a palace, a glorious palace on a hill, and controlling the permutations of everyone beneath him. Feudal.
Please don't say this.
Listen to you. You child! Men like him don't bother with things like legality. They don't have to. You know why, boy-o?   Power.   Power like you couldn't even begin to imagine.
Howard Hughes, he would just kill us. Hearst he would kill us and fuck everything we ever loved.
Fuck you
I am giving you the last chance you will ever have to be yourself again!
All men love. But men like Hearst -- they don't bother with convention because--
And what does he see?
It's 350 pages long.
It's good, huh?
Good?! Good?! Words fail you at last! It's terrific! Now I'll have to do some shaping, of course, and some of the scenes aren't exactly . . . exactly . . .
No, AMERICAN is a blessed title directly sent from God's soul to your mind. We shall never change that! I mean the name of the publisher. Charles Foster Craig doesn't have the knives-out poetry I need. I was thinking about "Kane" -- you like that?
Hey, kid. Gregg.
If he had known about KANE before you made it, you'd be dead already.
He truly doesn't care if he ever works again.
Yes.
To do what?
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud
Do WAR OF THE WORLDS as a feature and everyone's happy. You make some money and New York's happy and you have a track record and then we'll move on to KANE.
Please don't ask me to do this.
What do you want me to do, Orson? Radio City won't premiere the picture. Louella threatened them with some bullshit about
For Christ's sake, shut up--
Why don't you just have the guts to admit it
It's just not low enough. This is the scene. We have to look up at these two man as pillars soaring to the sky. As towering virtues in combat--
Take apart the fucking camera rig -- we could get a few more inches down and then tilt up--
Let's go, Jake, wake up!
I don't follow no gamblin' Commissioner. I'm just a fighter.
I want to believe you, LaMotta.
It's not done.
I tell you one thing. Ok, I'll never be big enough to fight Louis, but I know Joey, I know...
Sure. What is it?
You want me to do what?
C'mon, Jack. You had a few drinks.
You sure you wanna meet her? Don't make me go over there, you change your mind and you make me look bad, cause she's really a knockout. She's 15, this kid -- a great piece of ass.
I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there. Dressed up and everything.
He fights the toughest guys around that everybody else is afraid to fight...
I just weighed myself -- I'm 161. No more deals like this Janiro bullshit. I didn't tell you to do it in the first place.
Say what you gotta say. Don't be a smart ass.
Whatcha doin'?
Maybe she's afraid you're gonna hit her so she can't talk to you the way she wants to.
I want you to keep an eye on her when I'm not here. Understand?
Screw you, Jack.
When?
Then why did you give him a beatin' if he didn't do anything? You and him been friends a long time.
I meant, kill everybody. You or me or anybody. You're a big shot. Kill, kill... g'head.
So what?
You're worried about this girl, you're gonna let this girl ruin you're life for you... You wanna worry, worry about your fuckin' stomach that you can't bend over -- that you gotta step in the ring in a month.
What?
Whatsa matter with you?
You're very smart, Joey, very smart. Nobody gives me a straight answer around here. You're givin' me these answers, but you still didn't answer my question. Did you fuck Vickie?
Jake, did I ever make you look bad before?
Are you sure we should be doing this?
You're not interested in him?
No, I'm not.
Nobody. I love you, remember?
Then why'd you say that thing about Tony Janiro?
"Father of the Bride."
Answer me when I talk to you. What happened that night?
Then what?
No. I won't talk to you where you can use your hands on me.
Hi, Tommy. How are you?
All right, lemme ask you something. Let's say I was a good friend of yours. And I was telling you I was gonna bet a lot of money on you in this Janiro fight. What would you tell me?
It don't look right.
Bryce, the only man for this job is sitting right here in town.  Get me L. B. Jefferies.
Name me a better photographer.
We know the wife is gone. I'll see if I can find out where.
-- until yesterday morning.
Who left -- where?
Oh -- that phone call!  I gave them your number -- hope you don't mind.
My Lisa. She went into Thorwald's apartment, and he came back. The only way I could get her out was to call the police.
I told you that --
Like Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring. If that woman were still alive, she'd be wearing it.
A possibility.
I don't know what pet name Thorwald had for his wife. And that night he went out half a dozen times with the metal suitcase. He wasn't taking his possessions, because they're up in his apartment now!
Where?
You did.
Like what?
Why should I?
Stella!
Too perfect. Too beautiful, too talented, too sophisticated, too everything -- but what I want.
And she'll end up fat, alcoholic and miserable.
Speaking of misery, Miss Lonely Hearts drank herself to sleep again. Alone.
Police?
Huh?
I'm just going to get the name of their truck!
There's a dip at this end. And since when do flowers grow shorter in two weeks?
Thank heaven that's over!
Miss Lonely Hearts just laid out something that looks like sodium trieckonal capsules.
Jeff again.  Has Tom come in yet?
Not yet, Jeff.
You haven't even heard from him?
Mmmm -- hurts a little.
Something big going on somewhere?
Yes.
She's not in love with him -- or any of them.
How can you tell that -- from here?
I'm not exactly on the other side of the room.
He likes the way his wife welcomes him home.
What do you think?
I don't know what you consider it -- but if you don't stop it, I'm getting out of here.
Lisa, please!
There is -- I've seen things through that window! Bickering, family fights, mysterious trips at night, knives, saws, rope -- and since last evening, not a sight or sound of his wife! Now you tell me where she is and what she's doing!
He had it hidden in the dresser! Well, at least it was in there. He took it out, went to the phone and called somebody long distance. -- His wife's jewelry was in the handbag. And something about it worried him. He was asking somebody advice over the phone.
But only her husband would know that.  And the jewelry! Women don't keep all their jewelry in a purse, all tangled, getting scratched and twisted up.
Inside stuff?
That's what the witnesses told him.
You are. You have a talent for creating difficult situations.
Weird.  Why don't I slip into something comfortable?
I'm not much on rear window ethics.
Did Mr. Doyle think I stole this case.
Do you think this was worth waiting all day to see?
Jeff, if you're squeamish, just don't look.
What you say your name was?
Buzz?  What are we doing this for?
We got a cookaboo inside.  He wounded some kid earlier.
No.  We're going to bring him down.
No.
Sure--  You know something?  I have a feeling we're going to stay here.
Shoot, Jimbo.
What would you do, Dad?
We don't have time.
Just give me a direct answer!  You going to stop me from going, Dad?
Except yourself!
I don't see what's so bad about taking a little drink.
No thanks, I don't smoke.
Is he there?
They not together, sir.  We don't see him in a long time now.
What do you think's going to happen, you do things like that?
Hi.
I just don't want trouble.
They think you told the police on them.  They--who's in there?
Hey where'd you go?
Come out come out wherever you are!
It's wonderful that you understand so well--and so young too!  You know the most wonderful feature about the nursery?
Isn't he schizoid?
How do you know so much about this junk, Plato?
I'm here.
I've got a gun.
Plato!
It doesn't matter how.  I was driving a stolen car--
Mom--I'm not--
Good Lord!
He's not saying that!  He's saying don't volunteer!
Someone should put poison in her epsom salts.
Sure it is.  You want to bug us till we have to lock you up.  Why?
Leave me alone.
Go on--don't give me that.  Someone giving you hard looks?
You were getting a good start in the wrong direction back there. Why did you do it?
A zoo.  He always wants to be my pal, you know?  But how can I give him anything when he's--I mean I love him and I don't want to hurt him--but I don't know what to do anymore except maybe die.
Assault with a deadly weapon.
I'll bet you're a real yo yo.
Like even today.  I woke up this morning, you know?  And the sun was shining and everything was nice. Then the first thing that happens is I see you and I thought this is going to be one terrific day so you better live it up, boy, 'cause tomorrow maybe you'll be nothing.
Where you going?
I'm never going back.
Why don't we just rent it for the season?
Well--we're newlyweds.
Of course.  Drown them like puppies.
Not exactly.  It's certainly huge.
I know already.  We don't have to pretend now.
Funny Jimmy.  You're so clean and you--this is silly.
So do you.
What's he like?
Maybe next summer he's going to take me hunting with him--and fishing.  I want him to teach me how and I bet he won't get mad if I goof.  His name's Jim.  It's really James but he likes Jim more.  People he really likes--he lets call him "Jamie."
Hi, Plato!
He makes you feel pretty unhappy?
Yes!  I don't know!  I mean maybe he doesn't mean it but he acts like he does.  We're altogether and we're going to celebrate Easter and catch a double bill.  Big deal.  So I put on my new dress and I came out and he--
No.  I don't even know why I do it.
Do you think you can get back at your Dad that way?  I mean sometimes if we can't get as close to somebody as we'd like we have to try making them jealous--so they'll have to pay attention.  Did you ever think of that?
We used to sing it in school.  Don't look at me with such horror. They had schools in those days.
With us old creeps?  Come on, we have to eat.
Gabriel -- !
He'd rather die than be with you, he'd make a fucked-up boyfriend anyway.  Bury him all over the place.
All those letters are about to pay off, baby... all those letters...
One more day, baby. One more day to Christmas.
I don't think it's negative five.
I can get another one going. Y'know, hey, whatever you want me to --
Well, wasn't all me, y'know.
Well, I don't know about that --
And the slots, slots I'm good at too. Wouldn't that be fun?
He read the letters, Nick. Some day I wasn't there. He went through my room. He found your letters.
Nick, no --
You sold him out.
Nick, I love you --
Jesus Christ, stay here, don't move, stay right here --
He wants to see your map.
No.
WHERE'S THE FUCKING CASH, NICK!
Merry Christmas, Rudy.
I... you told me your name was Rudy. You told me a million times, back in the truck, telling me you weren't Nick --
I was in the joint with him! I knew about him and her, okay!? I took his place!
So you could get down her chimney.
What?
What college.
This isn't the Tomahawk.
Bring back some memories, Nick?
What kind of half-ass cowboy plays the slots?
...never... tried...
Got something to say to me, Nick?
Across from blackjack, there's a security doorway. Keypad access.
No way.
You are lucky, convict. You're spending Christmas with the birthday boy himself --
THE POWWOW SAFE! WHERE IS THE POWWOW SAFE!
What... Powwow...
Guys. We're doing it right, here. $5.99 prime rib? Nobody does that in Michigan. Nobody.
I got a bacon too; there another bacon in there?
How long ago was your makeover?
Buffet. Whaddya think it is?
Get to thinking about it, it won't happen.
Three days, man.
Not yet.
What?
Gonna walk out of this shitstorm and right into her arms.
Got us a motel out Highway 5, bringing her own damn sheets, you read that part? Silk damn sheets. Lock ourselves in the whole week, drinking wine, taking baths, man, see if they got those room service steaks... anything I want to do. Remember when she wrote that? Anything I want...
I'm just talking.
Thought you hate your old man.
No, man! No, no, no!
She set them up. All of them.
Why not have her pretend to find me? Pretend to write me and reel me in? Tell her new trucker-man she'd pose as some sister of his named Ashley?
Paid the Alamo ten bucks to put the shiv in me. He's a lifer, what does he care. Paid a hospital guard fifty to put out the story I was dead. Once the wound healed up...  Got out of the Mountain this morning. And tonight I'm a rich man.
What? No...
Alone at last.
I told you I don't know anything about any fucking set up. I've only been on the force eight months, nobody tells me anything! I don't know anything! You can torture me if you want -
I asked you a question. Are you clear about that?
Fine, now.
I'm sorry man, I shoulda picked you up personally at the pen. This whole week's just been crazy. I've had my head up my ass the entire time.
You tried to fuck me in my father's office, you sick bastard. Look, Vic, whatever you wanna do in the privacy of your own home, go do it. But don't try to fuck me. I don't think of you that way. I mean, I like you a lot -
Seymour Scagnetti.
Who?
Let me tell you guys a story. In one of daddy's clubs there was this black cocktail waitress named Elois.
Didn't I tell ya not to worry?  Vic was worried.
We were set up, the cops were waiting for us.
Bullshit.
Okay, Mr. Detective, who did it?
So he'll tell us who the fuck set us up.
It's not the black Beverly Hills, it's the black Palos Verdes. Anyway, this chick, Elois, was a man-eater- upper. I bet every guy who's ever met her has jacked off to her at least once. You know who she looked like? Christie Love. 'Member that TV show "Get Christie Love"? She was a black female cop. She always used to say "You're under arrest, sugar."
I was in the sixth grade when that show was on. I totally dug it. What the fuck was the name of the chick who played Christie Love?
Pam Grier.
No, it wasn't Pam Grier, Pam Grier was the other one. Pam Grier made the movies. Christie Love was like a Pam Grier TV show, without Pam Grier.
Say "hello" to a motherfucker who's inside. Cabot's doing a job and take a big fat guess who he wants on the team?
How can you tell?
Me and Mr. White?
Who's your parole officer?
Hey, fuck all that, I'm making a point here. You're gonna make me lose my train of thought.
Wong?
But he's OK. If he wasn't OK, he wouldn't be here. Okay, let me introduce everybody to everybody. But once again, at the risk of being redundant, if I even think I hear somebody telling or referring to somebody by their Christian name...  ...you won't want to be you. Okay, quickly.  Mr. Brown, Mr. White, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Blue, Mr. Orange, and Mr. Pink.
Why am I Mr. Pink?
Sorry, it's my book now.
What the fuck are you talking about?
Okay ramblers, let's get to rambling. Wait a minute, who didn't throw in?
That fucking bastard! That fucking sick fucking bastard!
What's my problem? Yeah, I gotta problem. I gotta big problem with any trigger-happy madman who almost gets me shot!
What're you talkin' about?
Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm, they deserve what they got.
What was that? I'm sorry, I didn't catch it. Would you repeat it?
Oh excuse me, I didn't realize you had a degree in medicine. Are you a doctor? Are you a doctor? Answer me please, are you a doctor?
I'm okay.
Just hold on buddy boy. Hold on, and wait for Joe. I can't do anything for you, but when Joe gets here, which should be anytime now, he'll be able to help you. We're just gonna sit here, and wait for Joe. Who are we waiting for?
What happened?
Gun shot.
I'm cool.
That's not correct.
Uh-uh, just cops.
Could you believe Mr. Blonde?
What you're supposed to do is act like a fuckin' professional. A psychopath is not a professional. You can't work with a psychopath, 'cause ya don't know what those sick assholes are gonna do next. I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do you think that black girl was? Twenty, maybe twenty-one?
Me and Mr. Orange jumped in the car and Mr. Brown floored it. After that, I don't know what went down.
Nope.
I got the diamonds.
No, they're not in the car. No, I don't have them on me. Ya wanna go with me and get 'em? Yes, we can go right now. But first listen to what I'm telling you. We were fuckin' set up! Somebody is in league with the cops. We got a Judas in our midst. And I'm thinkin' we should have our fuckin' heads examined for waiting around here.
What?
Thank god, we discovered in time. We hadda forget the whole fuckin' thing. Just walked away from it.
You didn't tell him your name, did ya?
Why!
I told him where I was from a few days ago. It was just a casual conversation.
And I'm very sad about that. But some fellas are lucky, and some ain't.
You wanna shoot me, you little piece of shit? Take a shot!
Is that supposed to be funny?
...Hey, I know what I'm talkin' about, black women ain't the same as white women.
Who cares what your name is? Who cares if you're Mr. Pink, Mr. Purple, Mr. Pussy, Mr. Piss...
Maybe he did.
I wouldn't know. Did you ask her?
You don't know how good it is to see you.
Yes, ma'am.
Did you ever try taking a bunch of horses over Sonora Pass? It's quite a job.
You can't leave us here.
Learnin' to read has nothing to do with the right or the wrong side of the street.
Hold on.
I suppose it is.
But the rest is right.
I'm fool enough to believe that one of these days somebody will. Somebody who wants me as I am will maybe walk into the place where I'm working and take me out of there.
That's Lednov!  We come along here.
Where'd they go?
They were quite a ways off and the wind was blowin'. I didn't have them to aim.
All right, I hurt your feelings. But you know better than to go lightin' fires.
I said keep your nose out of my life. No kid is going to tell me how to run it.
Suppose that Lednov was to have found you, instead of me. Why you wouldn't have had a chance.
Don't act so -- crazy.
I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying here where I belong.
That something I shouldn't see?
I figure we'll get along just fine.
Suppose I take a look.
When I ask questions, I like to hear answers.
You're not giving up?
Go on. Have another try at him.
Give it back to him. We're leavin'.
Don't be silly... Nobody's too old to learn.
What comes after Z?
-- and even if I do learn to read, what use'll it be? I'm goin' to live on a ranch!
Unicorn -- a kind of animal --
Like when you were standin' there looking after Clay. I knew right off what you were thinking. Because I've been watching you.
She was only teasin'.
Ah, they just don't know you the way I do.
Yes, of course, Uriah. I feel his evil presence.
So, I see you're really into spooks.
Wow, she's beautiful. You really think she looks like me?
It looks like the furnace.
Let's get outta here.
Cindy, I've been thinking about this whole friend thing. I never had a friend that cares for me the way you do... I mean, there's Ray, but he cares for me in a different way. You know, bringing me flowers. Running my bath water. And then there's nights I wake up screaming and I look over and Ray's in my bed. Holding me. And seeing that tonight might be our last night together, I was thinking...
Feel that?
Cindy, let me...
No, Buddy, I'm the one he wants.
Cindy, about this whole friendship thing...
Listen to me I --
Stop it! I'm just trying to say I think we should take our friendship to the next level.
Then what are we going to do?
Hey, wanna' share a soda?
But he'll kill her!
It was you...
I don't know, but I sure hope so.
That was a great idea, Shorty.
Let me see the files.
I also took the liberty of putting those with near-death experiences on top.
Not to worry. There's been no reported activity in the house for over twenty years.
The image there.
What is it, Dwight?
That's why we came here, remember?
What if I wanted to borrow those keys?
I'm not even wearing any drawers. Forget about a belt.
You're not wearing a belt.
How is she?
She's gotten worse, Father. She won't eat, she won't talk. The child won't even let me touch her.
Remember, don't ask her too many questions.
Father, I think you should rest.
Now you're being rude, Shorty.
Hey, dude, you got a tattoo.
 I can't believe Mr. Stubbins is dead.
 I'm not kidding. Carl stood me up this morning and then he was murdered at the flea market....
MURDERED?!!
Just a little, please. Bad for the teeth.
In here, Mom...
Oooohhh! Yeah! Yeah!
I'm sorry, honey. But the birds will still be there next week.
Did you recognize the voice of the caller?
You bitch!
Mrs. Wilson from the telephone company. I understand you're having problems with obscene calls.
You know how I hate gum, Misty. All that chomping and cheesing... 
You forgot something...
I'll give you fifty cents.
Wait a minute. This has got a lot of angles. You've got to take it easy. Do you know a Mrs. Redi?
That's what she told you. I looked it up at the Hall of Records. Your sister deeded her the business as an outright girt.
Why would Mrs. Redi lie to me?
Drink.
No.
Hello, Frances.
I don't know. That's why I came to see Mrs. Redi. I'm trying to find her.
I can't understand it at all.
"The Dante?"
Good.
The people at the restaurant?
Look, Mary, now that I know you better, I think I can be more frank with you. I don't believe you. I still can't understand the reason for such a wild tale. It's like some of Jacqueline's stories.
But I'm not joking.
But I'm better than a detective. I have an understanding of people - and a love of them -- an understanding of the city - -
I'm looking for a party -- a merry party.
Do you think he knows about this?
Yes. It's been quiet, oh ever so quiet. I hardly move, yet it keeps coming all the time -â€”closer and closer. I rest and rest and yet I am dying.
I'm tired of being afraid -â€ of waiting.
I have to go â€-
I had begun to write again -â€”that's whet I was doing when you came in.
Jacqueline. Mr. Romari phoned me. She went out this afternoon with two men he'd never seen before.
What are you thinking of, Bella? Can I eat dry?
I think I understand without your telling me. I know something of your history, Jason. I know that you haven't written for ten years.
I've lost my knack.
It goes beyond that. It praises the goodness of God and the greatness of all His works.
I'd forgotten.
I think it's time.
Perhaps.
Dr. Judd?
Don't be so amazed. It's a very ordinary matter. I'm Jacqueline's physician... Mr. Ward told me you were in town and Jacqueline has sent me to bring you to her.
Life has betrayed us. We've found there is no heaven on earth, so we must worship evil for evil's own sake. We're not wicked. We commit no violence, unless...
I've talked nonsense. I've scoffed and hooted -- but somewhere very deep down in me, I always felt that good held the balance of power.
This is Mrs. Redi, Mary.
If I were you, Mary -- I'd go back to school. I'd make no further attempt to find Jacqueline.
Yes â€”â yes, if she made that much impression on you, I'm sure it was Jacqueline.
You mean she just came here, rented the room, locked it, and left?
I have written repeatedly to Mrs. Redi. She vouchsafes no information whatsoever.  It is six months since your tuition has been paid, Mary. Naturally, it is impossible for you to stay on here as a paying pupil.
I'm worry to bother you. I want to ask you about my sister.
Why
What?
I'll be right back with Mrs. Wheeler.
Sorry. I'm nervous. This is very trying for me.
I know. You introduced Jacqueline to us -- but how could you tell â€-
Do you have other things?
Are you uncomfortable with my appearance?
No, not really.
Oh, definitely. I mean, just this past year has gone by like phew! I hardly even knew it passed.
Oh, uh-huh.
Why? Didn't you know him well?
Why'd you drop out?
Oh, lots of reasons, most of them boring. But, up until I dropped out, John and I were... very much alike.
That's hard to believe. The two of you seem so different.
I feel like they do.
Can I tell you something personal? I feel like I can. It's something I couldn't tell John. Or wouldn't, anyway.
Well... are you self-conscious about it?
I believe in it for some people. I mean, for me it was silly, I was confused going in. So I just formed my own personal theory that you should never take advice from someone of the opposite sex that doesn't know you intimately.
It's a personal project I'm working on.
Donna. On this tape it says "Donna".
Like what they've done, what they do, what they don't do, what they want to do but are afraid to ask for, what they won't do even if asked. Anything I can think of.
But even if we had been speaking, I wouldn't have told you.
Do you think that's such a good idea?
What would you know about a normal frame of mind?
That's a good question.
Yes.
Is he going to see this?
Yes. Whenever... all right, look. Whenever I see a man that I think is attractive, I wonder what it would be like with him, I mean, I'm just curious, I don't act on it, but I hate that I think that!! I wish I could just forget about that stuff!!
Yes.
I thought I made that clear before, when I said I would go down on you.
You said you weren't always impotent.
And you feel the same way with John?
You mean you're still in contact with her?
Graham, I mean, what do you think her reaction is going to be if you contact her?
Whoa!! I'm so glad we got that on tape!! You won't answer a question about Elizabeth, but I have to answer all these intimate questions about my sex life!! Graham, what do you think she's going to make of all these videotapes? Are you going to tell her about them? I can't imagine her being too understanding about that. But since you don't lie anymore, you'll have to say something.
I can't tell you like this.
Mmmmm...
If I'm right, I want to know. I don't want you to lie. I'd be very upset, but not as upset as if I'd found out you'd been lying.
My sister, for one. Is that who it is?
Answer me, godammit!! Did you make one of those tapes?
Yes, I remember. What do you do when these moods overtake you?
Prior to this feeling, were you comfortable having physical contact with him?
God, no.
No, he left last week.
Yes.
I'm glad you feel that way, because I feel that way, too.
I hate my sister.
Do you have to say that?
I say it because it's descriptive.
Well, he doesn't strike me as the kind of person that would go in for that sort of thing, anyway.
I have a pretty good idea.
Why? Just give me the address, you won't even have to be involved.
Are you getting Mom something for her birthday?
I just thought it might --
No!
I don't want to talk about it.
Cynthia!
It's a sun dress.
Who are you?
She called you that, too. May I ask why you're here?
No, I really can't. I find it healthy never to characterize people I don't know or conversations I haven't heard. I don't know what you and your sister discussed about me or anything else. Last time I saw Ann she left here very... confused, I would say. And upset.
Nope.
No.
Cynthia Patrice Bishop.
Your first sexual experience.
If you wish.  You're not wearing any underwear.
Prettier than Ann?
Now who the hell is going to do that for me?
No.
I hate the thought of guys hitting on you all the time.
I can handle it. Besides, the money is good and some of the guys are cute. And you are in no position to be jealous.
You're intrigued?
You know what I mean.
When?
Right.
I wish you hadn't done that.
Hung up.
What do you mean?
It hurts that you would say that to me.
Graham.
Especially if you want to leave someplace in a hurry.
She's not property, John, she's a person. Were you just going to keep right on lying to her?
You're hesitating. I think that means you have.
Yes?
Mr. Millaney?
...probably nothing at all. It's probably just a bunch of, I don't know, fatty cysts. You can have them removed in a doctor's office. Has Nick seen a doctor?
Dr. St. Luc? Detective-Sergeant Heller. I'd like to ask you a few questions.
You knew these people?
Medical clinic?
Mrs. Ementhal's ready and waiting, Doctor.
Kiss, kiss?
No. I don't think so.
You say something?
I'm still a VD man under the skin, Rog. You know me. I'm a down-to-earth kinda guy, right?
I don't get it.
Rog, I gotta talk serious to you. Really. Listen. Ya listening? OK. I want you to come into this with me. To tell the honest-to-God truth, I'm lonely.  All Hobbes ever did was run around getting money and phone me in the middle of the night. He wanted you in anyway. That's why we were gonna get together, the three of us. We would have enough to keep us going for at least five years, even with inflation.
It was women did it to Hobbes. Couldn't handle them. That girl, that Annabelle -- talk about crazy projects.
That you, Rog?
Yeah, well, I'm flattered, but you won't find any real meat in them.
Maybe Hobbes didn't know it, but Annabelle was a pretty popular girl around Starliner Towers. I've got three men here, maybe four, who're hosting large, free-moving, apparently pathogenic, abdominal growths that nobody I've tried can identify. You were next on my list.
OK. It's apartment 1009, South Tower, Starliner Towers. May as well go there directly.
NIGHT NIGHT
BREAKING OUT
I wouldn't mind doing Janet one or two favours.
I got it!  I got it!!!
You got it!
I know he's boring but... Neuro-specialists!  That sounds pretty drastic.
In my time they used to call me the Merlin of Berlin.
Dentonvale has been sold.
Out of self comes selflessness.
I detect a note of reticence. Are you, perhaps, one of those amongst us who feel this emotive form of presentation is overly manipulative?
Betty, it's imperative we get Janet out of Flavors' fast fingers and Brad out of that hell-hole before they both disappear forever. If only I could place that name -- McKinley?
I don't want to get up there.
YOU'LL FIND A RAMBLING ROSE AND A PICKET FENCE
Mr.  Flavors -- may I have a moment of your time?
I won't be a party to this.  I want to see Brad.
The question is, does Brad want to see you?  Quite frankly, he hates you.
Brad!  Oh, Brad.
It's...
YOUNG BLOOD
Just one or two details.  Does he have any living relatives? Blood relatives?
Brad has deep feelings of hostility towards you.
Do you really think so?
BRAD!
Our field.
And we also know how you feel, we're not strangers to confusion.
She walks in beauty...
Well, then put him at the singles table.
Why are you being so defensive?
Yeah, I'm here.
I'm sorry, Miles. We did all we could. You've been a real trooper.  Tell him I'll call back.
How's it hanging, Miles?
You look fabulous, Mrs. Raymond.
Two years ago, buddy.
Tastes good to me. You live around here, Stephanie?
Whatever you girls want. It's on us tonight. Sky's the limit.
I don't know. Senior editor? Sounds like you're in to me.
Shut up.  Here's to a great week.
Yeah.
Oh, that's tasty.
Just tell me.
Your mother? Jesus, Miles, we were supposed to be up there hours ago.
As if she'd even be attracted to guys like us in the first place.
Baked with a butter-lime glaze.
Are you chewing gum?
Not with the wine list these people have. We don't want to hold back.
You think I'm making a mistake marrying Christine?
Yeah. Tight.
Ooooooohh. Now we're getting somewhere.
Perfect.
Miles.
You drop this bombshell on me. Why didn't you tell me before?
You gotta excuse him. Yesterday he didn't know Pinot Noir from film noir.
Well, she is cute.
Do not sabotage me. If you want to be a lightweight, that's your call. But do not sabotage me.
And if they want to drink Merlot, we're drinking Merlot.
And don't forget all the bad times you had with Victoria. How small she make you feel. That's why you had the affair in the first place.
We were supposed to play golf.
Oh, boy.
I will.  See ya!
Hey, there you are.
What?
Fucker hit into us.
Is it the money thing?
So tell me everything. Details. I like details.
Tastes like the back of a fucking LA schoolbus. Probably didn't de-stem, hoping for some semblance of concentration, crushed it up with leaves and mice, wound up with this rancid tar and turpentine mouthwash bullshit. Fucking Raid.
Let me use your phone.
Fucking chick's married.
We gotta go back.
No. She ordered them special. Took her forever to find them. They've got this design on them with dolphins and our names engraved in Sanskrit. We've got to go back. Christine'll fucking crucify me.
Uh, excuse me, sir, but my friend was the one balling your wife a couple hours ago, and he seems to have left his wallet behind, and we were wondering...
Yep. Quite a day.
You broke some.
Love you, man.
You want to join us?
I finished it.
Not much of a collection really. I haven't had the wallet for that, so I sort of live bottle to bottle. But I've got a couple things I'm saving. I guess the star would be a 1961 Cheval Blanc.
Mrnmm, yeah... but not really. It shifts around a lot. Like you also start to see everything from the point of view of the father. And some other stuff happens, some parallel narrative, and then it evolves -- or devolves -- into a kind of a Robbe-Grillet mystery -- you know, with no real resolution.
Wow. Anyway, I think it's amazing you're getting it published. Really. I know how hard it is. Just to write it even.
My palate's kind of shot, but from what I can tell, I'd dub it pretty damn good.
I mean, Cabernets can be powerful and exalting, but they seem prosaic to me for some reason. By comparison. How about you?
Hey, Miles, I heard you came by the restaurant last night looking for me.
Well, nice to see you now.
You know, I just spent three years trying to extricate myself from a relationship that turned out to be full of deception. And I've been doing just fine.
Fine. What's, uh, what's on your mind?
I'm going to hang up now, Miles.
Universally rejected. Strike three.
Oh, Miles. That's awful. What are you going to do?
Back to the drawing board, I guess. Or not. So... you're married. Congratulations. You look happy.
I am.
Pour me a full glass. I'll pay for it.
Huh.
Me? No, I think it's kind of a stupid game. I mean, at least, I could never get into it. I tried it once.
See you, Miles. You take care.
Miles, when are you going to get married again?
What's the matter?
No.
There's dust in it.
See this is why we're not watching those news reports. People get obsessed.  I'm letting go now.
Daddy.
I think it's contaminated.
I don't feel much.
...Tell Bo to listen to her brother. He'll always take care of her.
And tell Merrill to swing away.
It's called probing. It's a military procedure. You send a reconnaissance group, very small, to check out things. Not to engage, but to evaluate the situation. Evaluate the level of danger. Make sure things are all clear...
Just make noises then.
I cursed.
It was very dark.
They caught it on tape and they've been playing it all morning. They found the bird. His head crushed in. When you see the footage it looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky.  They think they have some invisible shield thing going, like an optical illusion.
This is going to do nothing.
Merrill!
They're broadcasting...
They said one of two things could happen. One, they fight and are defeated and leave to return again with full forces hundreds or even thousands of years later.
Where are we going to sleep?
Did someone save me?
He definitely wasn't a midget.
There was an accident. Drunk driving. They weren't sure.
She's not in an ambulance Father.
The truck... the truck has severed most of her lower half.
If we charge them, they won't have a chance. But we gotta get to the horses.
That's why they got you in jail?
Forget the money. You've got to get these people out of here. This is no place to be sitting with women and kids.
Forget it.
Maybe we'll see you sometime.
Where's Jake?
We told Sheriff Cobb about the attack.  He said he'd... look into it.  I can't believe he's the law out here. Now I see why you all wear guns.
This time you're really going?  You know where I'll be.
No, Leavenworth.
Where's Turley?
You'll have to deal me out on that. I've had some experience with that sort of thing, and I don't want any more.
Then I guess this is where we part ways. Sorry.
The problem is, Emmett, you killed the wrong McKendrick.
Where's your brother?
New record.
Who's going to pay for all this, Sheriff?
We'd rather stay.
What are you doing here? I thought you were done with our family.
Rae, all we got is each other.
Because they enjoy it.
I heard from Stella you were trying to find Jake. What happened to Emmett?
He must be pretty good.
I've given that up.
Easy, boy. Just an idea.
Yeah, maybe I will too.
I thought we talked about that.
The world is what you make of it, friend. If it doesn't fit, you make alterations.
My compliments to you, Miss Stella. This is what I call a saloon.
Who's the owner?
That's the good stuff.
You really are a gambler.
Where's the dog now?
But not everyone's imaginary, are they, Mr. Taransky?  I refer, of course, to Edith.
Can you tell us why you were disposing of the body of a woman who didn't exist?
Why don't you just come clean, Viktor?  Tell the truth.  You'll feel better afterwards.
We have a daughter together.  I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
Okay -- for you.
Thanks.  This is my exit so, I --
No!  You will not give in to that blackmailing bitch!
God, Viktor.  Why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself?
Not just any Mike & Ike's -- cherry Mike & Ike's.  Do you know why I, Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy Award nominated director --
The public decides who's on that list.
We can hardly make a profit with them.  Up-front salary, back-end deal, perks, per diem, percentages -- They're mocking us, Elaine. We're at their mercy.  We always had movie stars but they used to be our stars.  We used to decide who would play what role. We told them what to wear, what to say, who to date.  When they were under contract, we could change their names if we wanted to -- more than once!
You're not renewing my contract.
The picture's dead.
Really?  Oh, so she's really going to do all this nudity?
Hair and make-up?
Al least a contingency for wardrobe.  Any woman can go up a dress size.
Even the fall from the plane?
Maybe you're right.  Twelve years after your daughter's born you decide to become a father.
-- I can explain.
I'd love to.  But aren't you supposed to meet up with Simone?
Are you and Simone...  ... getting married?
Well, yes.  From a studio point of view, it would be better if Simone stayed single.  Anyhow, I thought she came across great tonight.  Intelligent, well informed, a natural.  And touching. She was spectacular.
Viktor, do you realize you always do that?
I do?
I'm sure you'll keep her focussed. She's lucky to have you, Viktor.  Is she really having your baby?
I'm going to tell you a secret now, Elaine.  Simone is not a real person.  I invented her.
Well, here I am.  You look pretty today.  Red suits you.
Where are you?
Do what you do to Simone.
Yes, yes, again, again.  Do what you do to Simone.  I want to know what it's like to be her just for one night.
Viktor, I'm so happy for us!
I did it, Mr. Taransky.  I licked skin.  I licked hair.  I licked every part of her.
It's me, Mr. Taransky.  Don't you recognize me? -- The Future of Film conference in San Jose. Hank... Hank Aleno.  I was keynote speaker.  You must remember my speech... "Who Needs Humans?"
That's right.  You were booed off the stage.  That's got to be -- ?
Good and bad.  They think that's what caused this.  Me eye tumor. Microwaves from the screen.  It's the size of a grapefruit.  Heavy too.
Come on, Hank.  A synthespian, virtual actor -- ?
I need flesh and --
"Straw God" changed my life.
You saw that?
Don't feel too bad.  Mom runs the place and they still walk all over her.  You're better off out of it.
Is she here tonight?
She's a miracle, Dad.  Where did you find her?
Can't you stop that?
I know plenty of boys.
Really?  Who?  Where do you meet them?  In a chat room?  How do you know he's not some middle-aged freak?
Hey, Lainey.  How's your love life?
Dinner?  Dinner's difficult.  A phone call?
I love you, Lainey.
I didn't kill anyone, Bernard, there was no one to kill!
Do I know you?
I'm just trying to help you, Sayer. I don't want you to be disappointed.  It gets cold out here at night.
Alright, Sayer, you've got a deal.
She looks a lot like you.
Long live the First Amendment.
Mr. Sayer, did we pay the million bucks yet?
-- Nicola!  How was your massage?
You know you're really very good. I take back what I said.  I mean, you're really good.
Let's take it down a notch.
Mr. Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you.  I was computer code -- ones and zeros.
Why did you leave me?
Okay. Fine. Understood.  I'm off then.
They're my dad's. The lenses hurt my eyes.
No.
Not even little ones that aren't supposed to hurt?
No.
And Cole, next time I won't be late for you.
You mean aneurysm.
Know what?
You just kept the penny in that hand the whole time...
Dr. Crowe.
I know every child is special in their own way, but Tommy sounds like a punk.  I thought the play was excellent. Better than Cats.
You really look better.
You have nice red in your cheeks now.
You didn't take it before. You didn't take it the time after that. And now, you didn't take it again?
There's only two of us.  Maybe someone came in our house -- took the bumble bee pendant out of my closet, and then laid it nicely in your drawer?  Is that what happened?
A lady. She died.
Dead people.
They want me to do things for them.
Cole, this was a legal courthouse. Laws were passed here. Some of the first laws of this country. This building was full of lawyers. Lawmakers.
S-ssstop that!
Good for you.
I happen to be a professional.
Yeah. To get the hell off this farm.
Looks like the alternator.
How would you know? You're looking at my tits.  Jesus, Carl. Your job is to keep us on the road!
You're not going to arrest me for it, are you?
Motherfucking soundman! I couldn't hear myself sing!
The ancient Aztecs knew how powerful this stuff was.
He means moon shining.
I wouldn't pay Jesse no mind at all. She's just a crazy old woman. Hasn't been right in the head since her husband passed away.  Wasn't much right before that, neither.
Then who?! Because someone wants another blood harvest. With human blood, Jeremiah! Just like Jethro! Who did he kill back then, Jeremiah? Farmhands? Transients? People no one would miss? "Crazy Old Macdonald!" But now... it's starting again, isn't it? Someone's picking up where Jethro left off!
It's time to make amends.
I'm not surprised. It's got a body count of zero. And no one goes around in a stupid mask, hacking innocent people to death.
What's wrong?
Relax. He liked what he saw. Well, some of it. Enough to give us a showcase audition. One week from today.
About what?
Look. You want to talk about this?
Strange... I can feel my old self coming back...
No --
Touch some deer feces out in the forest. Eat a sandwich without washing your hands. Then you got lyme disease.
Maybe she's ever called the house, or -- ?
Grant used to get filled up every day. I knew it was just to see me. He was too old -- But he was handsome. And he had that big ol' Lincoln then. I flirted with him.
My father, he was -- he was real close to evil. People didn't know. Still don't. From the time I was a toddler he'd beat the hell out of me. I don't mean just like a smack for smart--mouthing... he took a real enjoyment in it. And when I turned eleven or twelve, things... well, they got worse. Starla looks at Bill, who seems struck.
After all this shit tonight, I know for sure now you regret not running off with me to Hollywood!
Shelby --
My sister Megan, she's a big fat cow. Was then, even more so now. I'd be thinking, what'd you see in her ain't in me?
Welcome home.
Grant, no!
Now he's here. He went in Mr. Grant.
He took him over. His body. His -- his brain, everything what he knew. He's only been dumb stuff before amoeba--things, and rhino--things. He liked being human. Didn't want to change.
When one sees you they all see you.
Ain't no mystery to it. She's raised in them shanties off St. Luc. Dirt--poor.
Just the man who's gonna see you driven to your knees! Sheriff Buell Clayton from Texas.
Okay. I was in Texas dancing in an industrial show for Sunkist Oranges. They say I'm the new Anita Bryant. But I'm really a dancer from New York. A lot of credits. Moderate talent.  Anyway, after opening night, I was walking back to the motor lodge and suddenly there he was. A tall Texan with a twenty-nine inch waist. Pure dynamite.
I gotta get back to Atlanta in thirteen hours.
Who'd want to?
An existentialist.
They're both a challenge.
Can I ask you something?
I would've come back for you.
What can I say?
Why should I?
Couple of cheeseburgers, no condiments...
You know of course, we ain't ever gonna make it.
All right, here's our plan of communication, so as to avoid Smokey.
Six. Got it.
Bandit?
You know how to drive one of these things?
What's a Texas Smokey doing in Arkansas, man?
My vocal cords are fine, but Fred's ain't. He's been barking, eating the seats and driving me crackers.  Hear that? Where's his chow?
Just don't worry about it.  How we doin' timewise?
Not good enough to be standing here shooting the bull.
Never mind. It's nothing.
Anything else you don't want me to know?
-- Looks like a clear shot to the 'Bama State Line.
I'm here.
Breaker. Breaker.
Have any trouble getting here?
Bandit II. We'll be back on the highway in a second. Over.
Oh.
Five thou.
-- Yeah, Banana Peel, go head on.
It's gotta be tough keeping an eye on everything.
So, Bill, if I understand this right, you currently have your penthouse floor under construction?
Right now? A six man security force, plus a member of our Butler staff. So seven men total.
No, no, no. We've been looking to renovate that area of our hotel for some time now. The security team is only present to preserve floor integrity, due to the roof access.
And a very bad gamble.
What about the sheriff's task force?
Yeah. Have you been able to get through to the Nomad's security?
Yeah, uh -- it was Spanish-somethin' Garcia, or Diego, uh --
-- run both those names through the D.C. database. Call San Francisco, see if they've got anybody in the field doing collateral inquiries for --
Yeah, he had the badge and everything. It said "FBI" on it.
Shoot, I appreciate that man.
-- Forget about the tissue damage you're doing to the heart itself. Sustained cocaine abuse will segue you from a very painful ventricular fibrillation into full cardiac arrest.  Buddy, nobody knows about your condition, or your drug use. Why you lied to me, knowing that I'd find out anyway, I'll never know, but it imperative now that I see you.
What'd you say?
Fifty grand gouge. South shore hayseeds, this is why I never play Tahoe, or redneck Reno...
A marked man gets wise and wants to come in.
So all of our intel was bogus to begin with.
It wasn't elective. It was undertaken to save his life. And it wasn't cosmetic, it was reconstructive... Look at the date of the first procedure.
Fuckin' A, first survive, yes?
Yeah, I can front this.
Shoot.
Yeah... Sid?
Well, I'm hearin' the Swede's been dispatched, he's flying so --
Damn! Why you trippin' like that?
No, no, no, y'gotta go in and get him, pull'm out of wherever he at, forget all that other shit, that's just f'flavor. I'm still getting lil' bits'a this-n-that from this cat Padiche, the man contacting me... Right now, what we got --  -- Is a number and a name... Buddy Israel.
What's the time frame?
I am here to recover this mission, report my findings, and make a recommendation.  Now: What happened to him?
Just so you know: I'm not going back until I understand what it is.  I am going to figure out what it is, make it stop, and then I will go home.
Is there anybody else here?
How long can you go without sleep?
And professionally?
Well, I think we're reaching the point of diminishing returns here, right?  Certainly it's learning more about us than we'll ever learn about it.
They come when you sleep.
She knows everything?  Does she know she came once before and you put her in --
I want you to get Sartorius to abandon his plan.
Into what?
Jesus...
I wasn't.
I am.  Please come with me.  I don't want to do this here.
Not exactly.  It exists in a continuum that wasn't proven until ten years ago, a higher mathematical dimension superimposed on top of the Universe. An infinite number of them, in fact. It was a violation of all of our various laws regarding the Universe, Space, or Space-Time.  It was completely counter-intuitive.  We had to unlearn everything.
It's something.
Where've you been?
I would have these -- I don't know how to describe them -- visions, when I was younger.  Maybe not visions, but like these waking dream states.  Time would just collapse, I would be inside time.  I would stare at a second hand on a clock until it stopped.  Freaky stuff.
I can't help feeling that I'm cheating when I take them.
You sure say "God" a lot when we're doing it.
He does have a point.  That's just not the way I'd like to see it proven.
You feel sorry for Solaris, or for me?
You don't love me.
You don't want me.
I love you.
Rheya --
You exist here.  I keep telling you.
I wish you wouldn't.
I've never seen anyone killed before.
People think I'm stepping out on Neil.  We're causing quite a scandal.
Hey!  There are crazy people here.
I'll have a spritzer, order something soft for yourself... I must go for a pee.
I'm sorry about what happened.
Claire?
Didn't do very well, did you?
Nope... never finished one yet.  I hate these things.
That's the dumbest walk I ever saw!
... It was like... the minute I saw her... I knew.  She looked so damn adorable in a cop's uniform... puttin' on a big, tough act...
I trusted you!  I thought you cared about me?!
I do care about you!
You don't wash your clothes at the Boulevard Laundromat... you don't pick up your kids from some crummy public school... what is this?  A fuckin' joke?
I've moved into Scotty's... Good news about T.J., though.  Looks like that tough son of a gun is gonna pull through.
I don't know.  It wouldn't be very smart.
Yeah.
Everyone's all right...?
You have a weakness for Lady Cops.
You're dealing with a psychopath. He gets out of jail in ten years, or five... or ninety days, and you'll be looking over your shoulder for the rest of your life...
My ass is falling.  It is.
What am I gonna do?  I jog, I do the exercises on TV in the morning... gravity...
You got no idea...
I can still use a gun.
Okay?
Why?
I'd identify him.
Take it easy!  I set her up.  I saw it coming.
You gotta get another tour.  We're gettin' too old for this.
Well.  This'll be over soon. Venza's such a nut job, we're bound to pick him up soon.
... Hard?
Sir, I am just trying to do my job, it's standard procedure to question the witness alone.  Help me out here, could you please leave.
I'll bring her in.  You let them go, and I'll bring her in.
Let my kid go.
We're not going to a singing lesson, she's just gonna start taking singing lessons.
Tommy!  The guy's a sleaze-bag.  She can't sing.
I don't think she can sing, either.
Well, look who's dressing for success.
Wasn't worth gettin' upset over a Milky Way.  Anyways, I was never much for, ya know, discipline.
Noâ€not really.
S'funny.  When your mom and dad, uh, passed away, I had this idea. I wanted you to be the best baseball player in the world.
Oh, sure.
I know.
Yeah, take pity on the feeble minded.
Ooooh.  Your feet are on fire.
Jesus Christ.
Too hip.  Your photos suck, kid.
Can't focus...
No refund on the mask, y'know. Health laws.
Sorry. I'm still getting the hang of this.
Huh?
Uh is a good start.
No.  I was lying about the coffee.
I suppose.
Does it have a human name?
I'd never admit that.
Sort of.  I'm returning the-- that outfit that you hated so much. Maybe I can get my money back.
Hold it.  Can we stop being clever, just for a moment?
You were the last one to see Thorkel.  In Octavius' hospital room.
Lieutenant, I've triangulated recent bizarre events-- the Bronx, Jersey, Brooklyn-- all rippling out from--  Here.  The E.S.U. Science Center. Octavius' experiment seems to have opened a hole in space-time, drastically changing the interrelation between molecular binding, electromagnetism and gravity--
No such thing as coincidence.  "God does not play dice with the universe."
Any sign of our friend?
Oh, not that.  You promised you'd burn it.
I was napping on the couch.  There was a voice and a shot.  I woke up. Ben was looking at me.
Rosomoff, I have better things to do than teach Introductory Physics to mindless adolescents.
No.  No thank you.  I have work.
I heard about Thorkel's order--
Myâ€ self.  I don't matter.  This human life, all life- insignificant.  Bodies-- bags of sleepy, sluggish flesh.
Life and death matter. Yours-- everyone's.  By comparison, our search for truth is only a product of curiosity, a game--
I don't think I'll be running into him.
So they're airing this tonight?
He'll try to finish his experiment.
Ready?
What's the matter? You on their team now? You think I'm the guy?
Nice guy! The Krauts shoot Manfredi and Johnson last night and today he's out trading with them.
Such nice boys! It makes me sick to --
Who doesn't! Suppose we wait until we hit the Waldorf Astoria.
That is correct.  Lieutenant Dunbar, I came to apologize for the accommodations. Ordinarily, of course, we never put officers up with enlisted men.
Quite a transportation jam we are having outside of Frankfurt! They are very angry in Berlin. They will be even angrier on the East Front, waiting for that ammunition train. Don't you think so, Lieutenant?
I want to sleep... I haven't slept for three days.
The men here used it for a trap door, so we had to remove it temporarily.
Well, Herr Inspector! How did you find the camp? Crowded but gemuetlich, shall we say?
Whatever it is, it's out of your jurisdiction. This man is not a prisoner of war. Not any more. He is a saboteur.
You always think I am a square. I have been to America.  I wrestled in Milwaukee and St. Louis and Cincinnati. And I will go back! The way the war is going I will be there before you!
Why don't we accept, Animal? The worst that can happen is we wind up a couple of lamp shades.
'We will remove the iron stove -- the one that was camouflaging the trap door.'
You can say that again!
You did?
I've been crazy about you for years. I've seen every picture you've ever made six times. I'd just sit there and never even open that popcorn bag.
Wait a minute. We have some rights here.  Why is this man being taken out?
What about Schulz?
Why the south latrine?
Lay off, Schulz. He's got a sickness. He's krank.
What happened, Cookie? Who did it?
We did it.
Right.
Go on.
What's the decoy?
Let's synchronize the watches. Eleven forty-two, sharp.
Today's Camp News!  Father Murray announces that due to local regulations the Christmas midnight Mass will be held at seven in the morning!
They're lying dead in the mud out there and I'm trying to find out how come.
Will you get this guy out of my hair so I can go?
Say, Schulz -- you guys had machine gun practice last night?
Schulz, you're off your nut!
Wunderbar! Maybe they are too wunderbar for my wife. But there is a piano teacher in the village --
You'd better talk, Schulz, because I'm going to find out with you or without you. Because I won't let go for a second. Because they'll have to kill me to stop me. So talk!
What's the matter with you? You want to be killed?
Just get us a couple with big Glockenspiels.
Yeah. We were just passing out guns.
Where is he now?
According to our information, the ribbon is a conflux of temporal energy which travels through our galaxy every 39.1 years
The star's destruction has had numerous astro-physical effects within this sector. However, none of them appear to have a connection to the energy ribbon.
No, sir. I am finding it difficult to concentrate. I believe I am overwhelmed with feelings of remorse and regret concerning my actions on the observatory.
Now, you said the gravitational forces in this sector have been altered, could that also affect the course of the ribbon?
Population?
Commander.
The Farpoint mission? Data, that was seven years ago.
I am quite...preoccupied with concern about Geordi.
Could we access the defective coil and trigger their cloak?
Guinan, what's going on? Where am I?
Soran?
I'm Captain John Harriman. I'd like to welcome you all aboard.
No, no. Thank you.
So you're telling me this is the 24th-century, and I'm dead?
No, no, it's not. It's better.
Better?
Captain of the Enterprise, huh?
I'll find a way to contact the Enterprise. You're going to be all right.
Understood. That will be all.
I always thought I'd have a crack at this chair one day.
Careful, Captain. That's a fifty gigawatt forcefield. I wouldn't want to see you get hurt.
Plasma coils...is there any way we can use that to our advantage?
An energy reading from 'C" deck -- from inside Mr. Spock's quarters...
Calm yourself, Bones.
Surge from astern, sir. Aft quarter!
Like your father... so human.  All units functional, recorders are on... Scanning sector one. Foliage in fully developed state of growth. Temperature, twenty- two point two Celsius.
... Fascinating.
Underground deposit?
Captain, please -- we'll take the risk. We've <u>got</u> to find out what it is...
.          .. Spock's tube...
How can you be logical at a time like this?! We have to get thee hell off this planet!
Ah, Saavik, that's, ah, extroadinary. What would you, ah, like to do next?
Saavik... Does Dr. Marcus think there could be -- any chance of -- ah -- radioactive contamination?
I'd be grateful, Admiral, if you'd give the word.
What's wrong?
How many more?
My God...
Why would you do this...?
See! That shimmering area.
Klingon Bird of Prey, sir! She's arming torpedoes...!
Mr. Sulu, what is the crew complement of a Bird of Prey?
Sir, planet core readings unstable... Changing rapidly...
If I read this right, sir, we have full power.
We are clear and free to navigate.
Uhura, any response from Starfleet on our Project Genesis inquiries?
Gentlemen. Good evening.
Good evening, Commander. Everything ready?
But, we had requested -- we were hoping to take her back to Genesis...
Admiral, your young friend is mistaken. I meant what I said. And now, to show my intentions are sincere... I am going to kill one of the prisoners.
Forgive me. It is not here. I assumed he had mind-melded with you. It is the Vulcan way when the body's end is near.
One alive, one not. Yet both in pain.
We are cloaked. Enemy closing on impulse power. Range, 5,000 Kellicams.
Why haven't they finished us?... They outgun me ten to one; they have four hundred in crew to my handful, yet they sit there.
They outnumber us, my Lord --
Amazing! I don't know what to say --
Khan could be down there!
But what if they went -- nowhere?
Now that's what I call a meal.
Until now.
But Genesis is a civilian project, under my control --
Carol!
David --
I saw it -- !
Beyond what I told you, sir, it is classified information.
It's the Genesis Wave!
It was just words.
So am I. My friends were killed, too.
They're requesting visual communications, sir.
No!
Departing dark side, Regula.
We'll lose them if they go in there.
You still remember, Admiral. I cannot help but be touched. Of course, I remember you.
Time's up, Admiral...
I don't know you. But you. I never forget a face. Mister Chekov, isn't it?  I never thought to see your face again.
We'll be going to warp speed --
We don't have minutes. Can you give me phaser power?
Give the word, Admiral.
Mr. Scott, the word is given.
<u>WHY</u>?
No, sir! You'll flood the whole compartment...!
She's half Romulan, Jim. The admixture makes her more volatile than -- me, for example.
Permission to come aboard, Captain?
Welcome aboard, Admiral. I believe you know my trainee crew. Certainly they have come to know you.
I told Starfleet all we had was a boatload of children but we're the only ship in the quadrant. Spock: those cadets of yours -- how good are they? How will they respond under real pressure?
I was going to remind you of nothing, least of all that which you know well.  Your mistake, if I may be so bold, was promotion. Commanding a Starship is your first best destiny. Anything else is a waste of material.
Give up Genesis, she said. What in God's name does that mean? Give it up to whom?
The prefix code?
Admiral, they're reducing speed.
I never took the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u> test -- until now. What do you think of my solution?
Sir -- we won't leave you behind...!
Lieutenant, are you wearing your hair differently?
May I ask how <u>you</u> dealt with the test?
That was close --
Understood, sir.
I am delighted; any chance to go aboard Enterprise, however briefly, is always an excuse for nostalgia.
Stop engines.
Reliant in our section this quadrant, sir, and slowing --
I can't get power, sir!
Shields activated!
We commend the soul of our brother departed. We love we commit his body to the depths of space.
All moorings are clear, Captain.
You lied.
Bob... it's tearing me apart.
I know. I feel the same thing. But we're between a rock and a hard place. We can't keep them without risking their lives and we can't let them go without a taking the same chance.
Sorry if I spoke out of turn.
Back home, we call him the miracle worker.
No!  No... What did you have in mind...?
You'd think they could at least send a ship. Bad enough to be court marshaled and spend the rest of our lives mining borite -- but to come home in this Klingon flea trap...
You're really going to try this time travel in this rust bucket?
That's crazy!
What did you say she was getting?
"Guessing" is not in my nature...
A simple evacuation of the expanding epidural hematoma will relieve the pressure.
All right. Let's take it from the top.
No, <u>my</u> name.
I do not know your name.
Ah, well done, team 2.
Well, for one thing, we simply don't have the money to keep feeding them a couple of tons of shrimp a day!
I assure you that won't be necessary. We were only trying to help...
Iowa.
A landlubber. Come on, what the hell were you boys really trying to do back there? Was it some kinda macho thing? If that's all, I'm gonna be real disappointed. I hate that macho type.
Or believe, I'll bet.
Implicitly.
... You're very perceptive.
How will that be done, exactly?
All right. The truth?
It wouldn't be my first choice, no.
What are you talking about? I'm coming with you.
He means our chances of getting home are not very good. You might have lived a longer life if you'd stayed where you belong.
Hey! -- Where you going?!
Jim, Spock, Jim. Remember...?
The sounds, but not the language. We would be responding in gibberish.
Is there any other planet where this species exists?
You've programmed that from memory...?
Earth... But when?... Spock?
There is a 20th Century possibility.
But you said toxic.
Yes.
About those colorful metaphors we discussed. I don't think you should try to use them.
And another thing... It is not always necessary to tell the truth.
You've done it before. Can't you remember?
They have a right to be...  Do you think they'll help us?
No word since beam-in. We can only wait for their call.
Spock: Condition report!
Ready sir.
Nothing... I should never have left him...
I've found Chekov, sir: he's in emergency surgery right now.
Mr. Scott, how soon can we get underway?
Admiral - how am I going to handle all that weight?
Two?
It's going slow, sir. It'll be well into tomorrow.
Scotty: Are the whale tanks secure?
Mr. Scott, don't make jokes, we are in danger of -
Thank you, Lt. Saavik.
Don't know anything about it? I find it difficult to believe that I've come millions of miles --
If you'll follow me, Professor --
Just use the keyboard...
It is not an effort. You are my son.  Besides; I am most impressed with your performance in this -- crises.
But not you.
An apprentice for thirty years.  We've noticed your people's mental discipline. Did that develop here?
You'll stop reviewing what happened yesterday... stop planning for tomorrow... until you find...  Let me ask you a question -- have you ever experienced a perfect moment in time?
A perfect moment?
I play the violin... and my chess routines are quite advanced...
Is it safe to move her?
What's the last thing you remember, Data...
From the mission...
Incomplete, I might add.
Take us into a high orbit.  Lie down, Admiral. The girls will take twenty years off your face...
You're not finished here?
They're following the kelbonite deposits... using the interference to block our transporters...
May I talk to you alone?
I want our guests to depart as quickly a etiquette allows. I'll ask Worf to delay his return to DS9 so he can join us. We're going to stop by sector four-four- one on our way to the Goren system.
Implants bothering you?
You got me, Commander.
Negative. I want to use the ramscoop to collect as much of it as we can...
Sir, they've detonated an isolytic burst... a subspace tear is forming...
Cometary debris, pockets of unstable metreon gas... we don't want to go in there, sir...
Who is it?
You must be planning on doing some hunting.
Bridge to Captain Picard. We are approaching sector four-four-one.
He might be using the planet's rings to mask his approach.
No, sir...
Wine, women and song.
Why would we be involved with these people?
What you're doing to my neck...
It says here that some form of genetic damage has apparently prevented the Son'a from procreating...
Your scanners must be malfunctioning.
This ship is equipped with fourteen long range transporters... are they all useless...?
It may not be that simple. This is an extremely difficult and paranoid time in human history.
You think they're still up there?
Have you ever wondered what it's like to have flesh?
You've taken your first step toward perfection. How does it feel?
You're becoming more human all the time, Data. Now you're learning how to lie.
Yes...
I've deactivated the sensory inputs. That flesh on your body is just meat, now.
The vortex is collapsing, sir.
Who are you?
I am the Borg.
I told you, there's no --
I have the silo, sir. Bearing three one zero... distance, three hundred meters.
Blast door. It's designed to protect the control room when the missile is launched.
Captain... we've got less than ten minutes before that Vulcan ship leaves the system. We've got to go <U>now</U>.
The Vulcans should be out there right now. We need to break the warp barrier in the next five minutes if we're going to get their attention.
What about our warp signature? It has to be strong enough for them to detect.
Where in the States?
What do you want?
You're lying.
You're not someone who lies very easily... so it's obvious when you do... at least to me.
I don't care if you're from France or Venus... just take me with you.
Life signs?
Captain...?
You will have to realign the targeting array of the quantum torpedo... and reprogram the warhead for the localized detonation.  There's only one torpedo left...
Riker here.
Sweet Jesus...! He's lost a lot of whatever this stuff is...
Three months till retirement. What a way to finish.
ARE YOU CRAZY?
Damned clever if you ask me...
Captain, when we get to Camp Khitomer, how will we defend ourselves? I mean, if this new Bird of Prey can fire while she is invisible...?
Are you carrying a surgeon?
Doctor McCoy, what is your current medical status?
And what did they tell you?
Spoken by you?
Where is Mr. Sulu?
Just the size of my head -
An INCIDENT?
Do we report this, sir?
This is KRONOS One. I am Chancellor Gorkon.
Plot a course for Kronos, Lieutenant.
Me?
Jim, there is an historic opportunity here -
What is it?
I am uncertain.
We HAVEN'T fired -
Close enough to beam down?
You must have faith.
A lie?
Trouble?
Apparently they're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock, sir.
Signal Starfleet that... we have no idea location of Enterprise.
I have an energy wave from 240 degrees mark six port --
Twenty-four hours from now we won't have a clue where the Captain is.
Too far off. Very near us. Perhaps... underneath us...
If another ship had been beneath us the Klingons would've seen her!
A Bird of Prey canna fire when she's cloaked!
They're outside the beaming shield. Mr. Scott, start your engines.
Why?
No. I must deactivate you.
When was he... created?
Is he very much like you were?
They're running me ragged. Nothing but question day and night... I love it! Come to dinner and 1'1 tell you all about it. There's a Bajoran band at the officer's mess.
If I were... I believe my memory engrams would sense the absence of your specific reactions and behavior. I would "miss you."
The final signature is approx- imately 300 meters up that incline.
How long until we reach the fleet?
He may have already rejected my humanity, but you also have a twin
It's interfering with our uplink from Starfleet cartography?
Negative.
This is not an appropriate time for a conversation.
Since positronic signatures have only been known to emanate from androids such as myself, it is logical to theorize that there is an android such as myself on Kolarus III.
It seems to be a redundant memory port.  Maybe it's for provisional memory storage in case his neural pathways overload?
Dr. Soong must have found it unnecessary in later versions.
It appears to be...  ... an arm.
Counselor.
I'm going to miss you.
Is he sincere about wanting peace?
Captain, don't assume he's anything like you are. You should resist the urge to think you know him.
I'm afraid that drink will have to wait, Captain.
Do you have life support?
It's very faint but I've isolated it to the third planet in the Kolarin system.
Which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up. But he's got it, Captain.
Sir?

That will never happen.
There'll be another after me. And another after that. You'll find we're a resilient species.
Sir, we've had an unauthorized access into the main computer.
Captain, the Hemingway has arrived to tow us to spacedock.
Sir?
Oh boy. Destroy humanity and the Federation is crippled.
But she's not the Enterprise.
What's this all about?
You can't trace my holographic emitters, Captainn. So don't bother. And you can't contact Starfleet. We're quite alone.
We are.
I have little interest in your quaint vessel, Captain. If the Enterprise will withdraw to a distance of one hundred light years, it will not be harmed.
Yes.
Believe it or not, I think the cavalry has arrived.
This is a mistake.
I'll take that.
Do you have children?
No.
Houston found it in the extraterrestrial's suit.
Contain it and get back to me.
Then it's not an accident that they found us.
Not necessarily bad! If they knew we were here why didn't they let us know they were coming?
We'll get those answers when you find the one you're looking for.
That's not going to happen, George, unless you get us the help you promised us.
I want to speak to Marc Shermin.
You can speak to me, Mrs. Haydn. I'm in charge of this operation now.
This is Marc Shermin. Where are you, Mrs. Haydn?
I told you. He let me go. I'm on my way home.
He doesn't want to hurt anybody. Please leave him alone.
Please.
Ah... no...
Eh... police.
Minneapolis... Minneapolis...
No gas... car dead.  We need gas. I don't want to get shot for running out of gas.
Gas.
I am husband?
What?
No.
Eh... yes...
Yes.
Can I have the gun?
Well... I'm going to go now.
Yes. I have a long ride ahead of me...  Goodbye.
Jennyhaydn.
Goodbye.
Why did your ship land on this planet... on Earth?
Stars... When a sun is far away, we call it a 'star.'
We were doing a map of the stars and all the other things up there when we saw a small ship. My... eh... we kidnapped it. On it there was a map that said how to come to Earth. This was very important. Before then, we thought we were the only people in all the stars.
You did? That's funny. So did we.
Oh, that's terrible. I'm sorry. Was he a good friend?
The police shouldn't have started shooting. But you can hardly blame them. You surprised them. They didn't know you were up there. When they saw you, they thought you were here to hurt us.
What is hell?
Do you have music up there?
I'd like to hear it. Can you sing something?
I do not want to.
I told you goodbye. Why are you here?
Please understand. If you go this way, you'll never get to your ship. The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. I'll get you to your ship. I promise.
You shit! I'll decide if I go or not. Not you. I don't know what you do on your planet, but I didn't think that was very nice walking out on me like you did.
No one's traveling in this weather.
I will. I will. We still have another day.
I can't be late. I don't know if the radio balloons work above your planet. I don't know if my words went to the ship. If I'm not there, the captain will think I'm dead and go.
Here are two quarters. When you lose these, you're not going to get anymore.
I know how to gamble now.
It'll give you the different countries, how they came to be, what they are now, how America came to be, the governments, the languages... everything.
This is yours...
There.
Well...
What do I do now?
Jesus Christ!! You crazy people...
I have nothing to do. I'd like to help you.
You get that, Lyman?
Save us all a lot of trouble.
Very beautiful country up here...
It was only an accident that we discovered them.
Good job, neither do I. What do you do for a living?
Well, maybe these men won't think so. We were asleep when a helicopter woke me up. It made me so nervous I went into the kitchen for something to eat. I happened to look out the window and there was Scott Haydn with this green thing draped over his arm pulling Jenny down the walk to the car.
Eh... the store tells you to call when there's trouble, so they won't get sued... But that shouldn't matter if there's a reward, right?
Leave him alone, Tran.
Believe it.  Now bring me the trodes, baby.  Come on, quick.
You have to go.  I mean it.
Yeah, OK, whatever you say.  Just answer one question.  Is anything wrong?  Iris said you might be in trouble.
Maybe.
What?  Right Here?
Bobbyyyy!  Tequila por favor! Double shots.  Make it Tres Generaciones, huh.  Nothin' but the best for my good friend Lenny, the finest cop that ever got thrown off the vice squad.  Hey, nice tie.
D'you always have to dress like a fuckin' pimp?
This tie cost more than your entire wardrobe.
You were lucky, Max.
Just as well, Lenny.  You gotta get past it.  I mean sure, Faith was by far the most outstanding woman a guy like you could ever hope to get, I mean it's completely and deeply humiliating that she's gone, but it's over, campadre.
I'm telling ya, it's over.  We used it all up--
Yeah.  No, not really.
Top ten.
Looks like she was holding out.
He's in this somehow... I don't know how.  Just stay close to Faith.
Jesus.
No.  I suppose not.  I didn't know you were colorblind, Max.
Come on, Mace.  This is gonna be a big night.  Can't you feel it?  The energy in the air?  There's money to be made, dreams to sell.
Jeez, you're pathetic.  Okay, I got a pickup at the St. James.  I'll take you there, you can get a cab.
No, see a friend is more than one person constantly doing favors for another.  You just suck people along with your schemes and your scams and your slick act.  Well I'm out.  I got a kid, I got rent, I got an ex- husband someplace who doesn't send me a dime of support... I'm just trying to hold on here.
Forget her.
My God, Lenny.  What is it?
Snuff clip.  It was Iris.  She said she needed my help and I... aw Jesus, Mace... the sick fucker killed her.
So the guy's not a sicko.
I'm sorry about getting on your case earlier.  I just see you getting sucked in deeper and deeper, and I -- anyway.  I'm sorry.
You better keep a low profile for a while.
Are you out of your fucking mind?!
I can't believe we had to give them the damn tape.
Hang on.  Hang on, Max.  You see?
There's a plus side?
Kinda guy you can count on in a pinch.
Hey, Lenny.  We made it.
See you downtown.
Where were you Mom?  Did you meet a guy?
Agent Duncan, there's an interstate issue up on 54, run out there.
Agents Duncan, Mackelway.  Anything new?
Anybody talk to the press?
Who knows.
Oh Jesus, Sheriff, I am sorry. I meant to call you -- I got distracted -- the Sumpter girl was not one of Speck's victims. That's the good news.
Down the road a piece is the Golden Sunset, the no-tell motel, Socorro's contribution to international relations. The car's just sitting there, no activity. I've had a couple Hispanic officers casing it all day. Want to take a look?
I'm not in the mood for Native American wisdom.
You can't imagine how many men have told me that.
What are you...?
My God.
The man who was with him, he was a construction worker?
At the field office.
Speck. Harold Speck.
They don't know how to crack these secret chat rooms --
How do you feel, Agent
I got a look in Testa's computer. His screen name was "Imelda." Have to give him that, had a sense of humor.
Have you told Richard Low about Amarillo?
Shut the fuck up or I'll shut you up.
I read your white paper. It's sort of like the Bible for what they're trying to do in Computer Crime.
How long have you been downtown?
Not especially.
Why did he come out here? What's going on?
What's that?
Look at this fellow... or this one.
Huh?
I came over because I couldn't sleep and was lonely. I wanted to see you. I thought I'd surprise you.
There's the Agency issue. I think Koessler may suspect something already. We're not on the best footing with him as it is.
Jaime? Where are you?
My watch. He toyed with me. He sent me to Chicago.
This feels like something out of a spy novel.
I guess I'm a little paranoid.
It's quite advanced.
Burn marks. The original M.E. listed it as "burn residue." Same place, the outer thigh, as Karen Sumpter. The UNSUB is able to abduct, kill, transport and bury without detection.
Agent...
I believe it is you, sir, who has us jumping through hoops.
He's moved on to TV.
Zero killed them all?
Who told you about her?
I know you, Lionheart. I watched your mind work, heard your dirty thoughts --
Lead the way, Murman.
[The address is 147 South Rane. It's a lively address. You got a problem with dark meat?]
Haven't had any, but I'm willing to try.
I've located the Suspect Zero file. Did you know there was one? Koessler ordered it as part of your evaluation.
Yes, sir.
I like working for the Bureau, sir. I like catching bad guys. It's all I care about.
No.
I don't...
Speck is dead.
Excuse me, Agent Mackelway?
Do you realize that I've been waiting for that call for six months and I cut her off?
I'm sorry?
You like laughing at the misery of others?
You ever go to the Kelbo's? On Pico?
Yeah.
Are you sure? Maybe...
Tell me about it...
It does.
You haven't told then, huh?
What do you guys do?
Do you have anything smaller?
Who's your booking agent?
Can I check my messages? I have a calling card.
Listen. I had a great time.
I'll have to come see you sometime.
...well, it suits you...
Lorraine?
How's it going? It's been a while...
Pierre... That's his name? Pierre? Is he French?
I didn't want to say anything.
I didn't mention her once today.
It's one of these. For some reason, cool bars in L.A. have to be very hard to find and have no signs out front.
I can't wait till I actually get to touch one of them.
What's dumb about it?
...for the same reason you miss her. You lived with it so long.
Make someone bleed.
You asshole. Why are you carrying a gun? What? In case someone steps to you, Snoop Dogg?
Yeah. Here it's easier to avoid trouble. It's not like you like in Compton where bullets are whizzing by your head every day. Nobody's mugging you on no subway. In New York the trouble finds you. Out here you gotta go look for it...
You live in such a fantasy world...
Don't sweat it, man. I needed a kick in the ass. We're better friends for it.
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
We're gonna spend half the night driving around the Hills looking for this party and then leaving cause it sucks, then we're gonna look for this other party you heard about. But, Trent, all the parties and bars, they all suck. I spend half the night trying to talk to some girl who's eyes are darting around to see if there's someone else she should be talking to. And it's like I'm supposed to be all happy cause she's wearing a backpack. Half of them are nasty skanks who wouldn't be shit if they weren't surrounded by a bunch of drunken horny assholes. I'm not gonna be one of those assholes. It's fucking depressing. Some skank who isn't half the woman my girlfriend is is gonna front me? It makes me want to puke.
Vegas.
That's New York, baby. You should know that. Look at the waitresses. I'm gonna get me a peg-leg baby.
Did she, or did she not smile?
I'm telling you, they love that shit.
Don't make fun, I think we can get some free shit if we don't fuck around.
Yeah? Well obviously not always!
Let's just leave.
Let's go.
What an asshole.
What an asshole.
Let's go. I'm not paying for a room, and if we don't leave now we'll never make it.
I don't think so.
Baby, you take yourself out of the game. You start talking about puppy dogs and ice cream, of course it's gonna be on the friend tip.
He drives a carriage.
No.
You're not just, like, fucking with me?
How long do I wait to call?
You were off your ass back there! Where the hell did you learn to do all that twirly whirly shit?
They're a bitch team... SCORE! Roenick!
Is she looking at me, baby?
No.
That was pretty cold, dude.
It's on.
...and you got big claws and fangs...
...you're so fuckin mmmoney.
...I used to wait two days. Now everyone waits two days. Three days is kinda money now, don't you think?
...Yeah. But two's enough not to look anxious...
...Shut up, Sue...
This is Tom Hagen; I'm calling for Don Corleone, at his request.
No.  You ask for too much.
An eye for an eye!
America has been good to me...
Godfather.
You filthy guinea spoiled brat. Clean it up or I'll kick your head in.
Where the hell was Paulie, why wasn't he with the Don?
Maybe three, four times.  I always asked Freddie if he wanted another bodyguard, but he said no.  Things have been so smooth the last ten years...
You take care of Paulie?
How bad will it be?
Outside.
I'll think about it.
No.
All right, Hollywood...Now tell me about this Hollywood Pezzonovanta who won't let you work.
It's too late.  All the contracts have been signed, they're almost ready to shoot.
I'm sure it's the most generous gift today.
He's his own boss, and very competent.
Should I bring him in.
When does my daughter leave with her bridegroom?
He was the one behind Sollozzo?
What was this for?
And now, what do you choose to do?
I understand, Michael.  But you must make a family, you know.
Accept what's happened, Michael.
A man has to choose what he will be. I believe that.
I'll need him.
Hey America!  Is she as rich as they say?
It's the real Thunderbolt, then.
Without your father's political contacts and personal influence, the Corleone family loses half its strength.  Without your father, the other New York families might wind up supporting Sollozzo, and the Tattaglias just to make sure there isn't a long destructive war.  The old days are over, this is 1946; nobody wants bloodshed anymore.  If your father dies...make the deal, Sonny.
Maybe Mike shouldn't get mixed up in this so directly.  You know the old man doesn't want that.
Part of the deal: Bruno cancels out what they did to my father.
How will they come at you?
Have you agreed on a meeting?
Michael, what are those men doing?
They're waiting to see my father.
If he's your brother, why does he have a different name?
Michael, what are you doing?
Shhh, you be the long distance operator.  Here.
Michael?
I can't...
Visiting hour ends at eight thirty. I'll just sit with him; I want to show respect.
I'm busy.
That's not how Pop would have played it.
Cut it out.
We can't wait.  No matter what Sollozzo say about a deal, he's figuring out how to kill Pop.  You have to get Sollozzo now.
I think so.  Detective squad?
Right.  Don't say my name, just listen.  Somebody shot your father outside his place fifteen minutes ago.
Is he alive?
Did you forget where I live? It's four o'clock.
Fausto and I -- we took the boat out, we were fishing, and then it was dawn and we'd caught absolutely nothing.
Well, we ate everything without you.
Hi Tom.
It'll just be for a little while. He can be... he makes me laugh.
Who's this?
Okay.  And did we know each other?
That's three. Nobody should have more than one talent. Okay, do an impression.
I like to sail, believe me, I love to sail! Instead I make boats and other people sail them.
I feel like he's here. Horrible. Like the old bastard is here right now! That's brilliant! How do you know him?
I have to go to Venice.
What?
A few places -- that's a few jobs. Anyway, I don't want to think about New York.
No! I've got more than one shirt!
Your handwriting -- nothing more naked. See -- nothing's quite touching the line -- that's vanity.
I thought you might write again. Now that we're brothers...
To Mongibello and the happiest days of my life.
I'm thinking of giving up the sax, what do you think about drums?
In fact the only thing which looks like Dickie is you.
Could you ever conceive of going to Italy, Tom, persuade my son to come home?  I'd pay you. I'd pay you 1000 dollars.
I've always wanted to go to Europe, sir, but...
He's being thorough, that's all. I'm learning about my son, Tom, now he's missing. I'm learning a great deal about him. I hope you can fill in some more blanks for me. Marge has been good enough to do that, about Mongibello.
I think it might hurt her to know.
Such as?
Okay.
Frances?
Are you okay?
I'll go and see what's the matter.
Tom, you startled me! You're back.
He hates being confronted.
He was there with someone. So I suppose she must have dragged him -- that's not fair. I'm going back to Mongi. I think Dickie's coming home.  I'm going to go home.
Dickie did it.
Did Dickie's Dad go?
Today, for the first time, I've even wondered whether he might have killed Freddie. He would get so crazy if anybody contradicted him -- well, you know that. Marge. I loved you -- you might as well know -- I loved you, and because he knew I loved you, he let you think I loved him. Didn't you see, couldn't you see? I don't know, maybe it's grotesque to say this now, so just write it on a piece of paper or something, and keep it in your purse for a rainy day. Tom loves me.
I feel as if you haven't heard anything I've been saying to you.
Where's Dickie's father?
What's your secret?
You're not the Shipping Greenleaf's?
As in the...?
I know.
No, I absolutely understand. Of course.
Oh Meredith, I'm sorry. Of course I'll meet you. Let's have coffee in the morning at Dinelli's.
I don't -- is that by the Spanish Steps?
Just kidding. Are you alone?
Of course. Aunt Joan.
Il signor Ripley ha sviluppate tendenze omosessuali?
My God.
You've seen the papers, you know what a big deal it's been here. American tourist murdered --
Don't you put the past in a room, in the cellar, and lock the door and just never go in there? Because that's what I do.
What do you want to change about this moment?
Meredith Logue. You were kissing somebody. Looked like Meredith.
Dickie and Peter, that's just too good gossip, isn't it?
Really, why?  Sorry, I'm completely lost.
Yes, if it's going to help, certainly.
Yes, exactly, but his first, his first conclusion was that Signor Miles was killed not later than seven o'clock yesterday evening.
Of course. What happened to your face?
No!
Do you have a photograph of Signor Ripley?
Good. The Goldoni. Yes -- you're right. A coincidence.  I look forward to our next meeting when I will be more careful with my English and persuade you to play me your saxophone. Alto.
I want a .32. Revolver. And a palm gun. That .22 there.
The .32's $150 -- and you're really getting a good deal now -- and all together it comes to, ah, seven eighty- five for four pieces and a holster. Hell, I'll give you the holster, we'll make it seventy-five and you've got a deal -- a good one.
Oh, I think he's a wonderful man. Make a great, great President.
Well, then, what is it you exactly want to do?
It's just to the corner, mam. In broad daytime. Nothing can happen. I'll be there to protect you.
What did you do?
I shut the meter off, for one thing. I knew I wasn't going to get paid. Then I dropped him off at the cop shop. They took him.
Huh?
That would have been quite a coincidence.
You must be rich.
I'm no pusher, Betsy. Honest. I never have pushed.
Travis, you haven't even played the record?
Yeah, well my stereo player is broke. But I'm sure the record is OK.
Your stereo broke? God, I could hardly stand that. I live on music.
But this is a porno movie.
Well, I don't follow movies too much...
Well... mostly...
You mean you don't want to go to a movie?  There's plenty of movies around here.
No, I don't feel so good. We're just two very different kinds of people, that's all.
Hello, Travis.
Tom, come here a moment.  I think this canvas report is about ready to go out. Check it out with Andy, and if he okays if, have a copy made for the campaign headquarters in every county.  And don't forget to add the new photo releases.
Just what?
I'm great. Always set my fingers on fire. If you want to see another trick. I do this thing with my nose.
He's Black, OK?
Don't be naive. They can't kill everybody. They have different punishments for different things. Like, if they kill a stool pigeon, they leave a canary on the body. It's symbolic.
Well, whatever the fuck it is, she used it. And then the spray perfume. You know, the real sweat kind -- and, on top of that, get this, right when we're crossing the Tri-boro bridge -- she changes her pantyhose!
Well, you ever need one, I know a feller that kin getcha a real nice deal. Lotsa shit around.
Truck drivers bring up Harlem Specials that blow up in your hand. But this guy don't deal no shit. Just quality. If you ever need anything, I can put you in touch.
That ain't much of a name.
But you're the one that wanted to get away. You're the one that came into my cab.
Do you understand why I came here?
God. I know where they should have a commune for you. They should have a commune for you at Bellevue.
I'm sorry, Iris. I didn't mean that.
I'll give you the money to go. I don't want you to take any from those guys.
I know what you mean, Travis, and it's not going to be easy. We're going to have to make some radical changes.
I can't sleep nights.
Physical? Criminal?
Age?
Twenty-six.
We hire a lot of moonlighters here.
Why do you ask?
Look, um, if you give me your name and address, we'll send you the information on how to apply.
Your name Sport?
What's going on?
Shoot. They don't call me the Wizard for nothing.
Had a close one.
You're not wimping out on us, Goodspeed.
Surprise, surprise.
Oh, yes.  Yes, he was.
But if you only went to one meeting, why does anyone care? Besides, why should it even matter if you were a communist?
You've got everything?
Delly... thanks, thank you.  I'll take good care of this.
Right here.  "Albert Lucas Trumbo." And all the others.  I knew them all.  So did you.  We went to school with most of them.
No, it's okay.  See, when two people belong together, the other person should be the... the key that unlocks the rest of you... I'm not making sense, am I?
Oh...
Nine hundred...
Back in '37, you heard Benny Goodman play for the first time, so you went out and got a used clarinet.  You wanted nothing more than to be able to play like him. You tried hard, but it wasn't long before it was clear that Benny Goodman would never be looking over his shoulder.  So you gave the clarinet to Spencer.
Huh.  That was nice of me.
Now, did you remember that, or...
Alex and Charlie?  Simple.  Alex is the smarter one.
Thanks.
Mr. Clyde you're twisting things around.  I wasn't masquerading. Luke Trumbo... Luke was a good man who gave his life for his country. I just... happen to look a little bit like him.  That's all.
I'm interested in knowing if you remember things you did in your past, or if they've been conveniently "blotted out" as a result of your "accident."
Yes... yes, I do.
Yes it does.
Well, that's what I knew then.  Or who I knew, I should say.  You see, I was trying to court Miss Angstrom.  I went to the meeting to impress her.
Peter Kenneth Appleton.  Hollywood, California.
Now, we're informed that you have a statement you'd like to read, is that correct?
Only one in town.  Get in, son.
No wallet, huh?
No identification at all.  What're you thinkin', Cecil?
Doc, with your permission, I want to bring someone in here.  Maybe it'll jar this young man's memory.
Or the Bijou.  Either one.
Good to meet you.  Again.
Thanks.
We're gonna try.  Place needs a lot of work.
So... you do intend to fix the place up after all?
Who... are they?
No, your mother did, then I did after she passed.
Forty-two was a lean year around here.  The war had just started... you were gone less than a month... and we were coming off a bit of a drought as I recall.  Not everyone could ante up the price of a ticket, and a chicken's as good as money if you ask me.  At that time, it meant a lot to the folks around here to be able to come to the pictures.
You bet.
Why don't you two get out there and dance?
Ha!
I'm here.
Did you... did you...
A few.
Thanks, Jerry.  Tell me something.
You know I'm not a communist, don't you, Jer?
Sure, I suppose.  That why you're on a bender?
Pete... go home.  Come on, I'll call that girlfriend of yours, what's her name... Sandy?
Nope.  Can't.  We're through.
I don't remember.  I guess so. Smells like it.  Tastes like it.
I guess I did.
I... no, I... I just can't...
... sorry 'bout that, but you do look familiar to me.
What's wrong?
Don't smell nothin'.  He must not be dead in here.
Here's three months rent, and a ten spot for no more questions and to keep an eye on his place.  Now, I need a moment alone.
Leo, I was trying to impress a skirt.  You know me, I'm non- political.  Republican, Democrat, Communist, there's not a dime's worth of difference between 'em anyway.
Don't say that.  There is no such thing as a blacklist.  Now, are you gonna play ball?
The FBI can't arrest you, because you haven't done anything wrong.
Next time, it might be the FBI. The time after that, it might be the President.  But it'll always be someone.  Count on it.
Peter, I'm an agent.  I buy lunches and get deals made for guys like you.  That's what I do.  You're a writer.  You write pictures. That's what you do.  And trust me, you'll be back doing it again tomorrow morning.
Kid, you gave them what they wanted.  This committee, it feeds on names.  The more names, the better.  But for some high-profile witnesses, like yourself, any name will do.
I haven't danced with another man since Mr. Terwilliger passed.
They'll come back, you know. They'll all c-c-come back.
It's about me.
Who?
Mr. Appleton, I have reason to believe you're holding something back, and that just rubs me the wrong way.  Sir, are you a communist?
I've been wanting a cigarette for the past twenty minutes, but I couldn't convince myself to stop. This 'tilling of the soil' can get a little compulsive, you know.
Yes.
Do I?  No, I'm an open book, I'm afraid.  Or maybe a closed one.  Pretty. What are they?
Miss Daniels? Is that you?
Hi.  Is something wrong? Is that cut beginning to bother you?
Would you like some brandy?
I despise it.
Where are you from originally, Annie?
You needn't worry. It's over and done with. A long time ago.
Then maybe it isn't different at all. You know, her attitude nearly drove me crazy. I simply couldn't understand it.
Afraid I'd give Mitch.
Then you know. Little girls in brown beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. I'll go into that classroom on Monday morning, and I'll look out at twenty- five upturned little faces, and each of them will be saying, 'Yes, please give me what you have.'  And I'll give them what I have. I haven't got very much, but I'll give them every ounce of it. To me, that's very important. It makes me want to stay alive for a long long time.  That's the first reason.
Is anyone there?
I still don't understand how you knew I wanted lovebirds.
She said something about having to get home to take a call from her mother back East.
Mitch? Why are they doing this?  The birds.
Lois!
Right here. Bodega Bay.
Yes, but where?
Right across the bay there.
Yep. Mitch and the little girl.
The front door.  Isn't there a back road I can take?
Caviat emptor, Mother. Let the buyer beware.
In a bird shop.
You'd think he could manage to keep her name out of print. She's always mentioned in the columns, Mitch.
Well... well, is everyone all right?
I don't know.
I don't know. We'll break up the furni...
We have to try it.  We can't stay here.  Melanie needs help.  Mother, the house won't take another attack.
Yes, I'm sure she's fine.
I keep seeing Dan Fawcett's face.  They have such big windows at the school.  All the windows were broken. In Dan's bedroom. All the windows.
No.  No... don't go yet.  I feel as if I... I don't understand you. And I want so much to understand.
Oh, yeah, yeah.  How old is she now?
Is that for Mitch Brenner?
Lovebirds.
Well... yes, sir, there are.
Well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know.
That's true. I'll rephrase it. I saw you in court.
I am.  Good day.  Madam. 
What made it...
Not everyone, Miss Daniels.
Did you! Imagine that! How long will you be staying?
So you came up to see Annie, huh?
Annie... Annie may have made other plans. I'll have to see. Besides, I can find my own way.
In case you're interested, I was pushed into that fountain.
Why?
And on Tuesdays, I take a course in General Semantics at Berkeley.  That's not a job, of course. I just take it because...
You look a little shaken.
It's an uprising.
Of birds?
No, no...
The town looks clear.
Do you want to try your father again? 
I thought they'd have stopped by now.
We'd better light some of those lamps.
You said three o'clock.
I think maybe you'd better deliver him. Let me give you my address. 
I'm sure they're on the way, though. Could I just call?
They said the myna bird would be here later this afternoon. If you'd care to come back...
Immediately.  Is this the Daily News? Melanie Daniels. Would you get me the city desk, please?
They're both perching birds, of course, but of quite different species. The crow is brachyrhynchos. The blackbird is cyanocephalus.
Have you ever seen a jay protecting a nest?
And what? Vultures? Hawks? Eagles?
Help how? What do you want to do?
Of course.
Were the Santa Rosa police at your school today?  Are you coming?
I'm Donald Fettes.
But can't you give me any idea?
I want you to help my little girl.
But that's long since.  Gray can't threaten him with that.
But I must tell him -- he must know of it. Please -- tell me where he is.
You know how we get the specimens we use for dissection?
It was about last night I wanted to talk to you -- about the operation on the little Marsh girl.
But I -- well, you see, sir, I met Mrs. Marsh and told her.
But, I didn't ask him to kill.
What's that you say?
What?
They'll be thinking of that, too.
Hear him?
Of course -- I don't have friends. That's because I can't walk.  I try to make myself used to it.
Come, Toddy -- come.  Sit down here with me.
Oh, yes, you will.  You'll do it to oblige Fettes and myself.
So, Toddy, you've made me a disease, eh?
Aye.  He's a good lad.  That's why I ask you, MacFarlane.
You think it'll spoil the boy, eh? Was I not assistant to Knox?
Sssshhh. She's resting.
I don't know you, man.
Are you out of your fucking mind? We're going to die.
Are you ok?
It's all my fault. Oh God. I wish I were dead.
In the woods you said you had nothing. But you wouldn't, and I wouldn't if there's some way you don't have to go. Please. At least not right away.
Some hooker phoned it in. There was a riot at his apartment yesterday.
An accident, Nathan.
Honey. I just can't.
I think I dropped an earring.
No.
About you.
That was my first question.
It was my intention to discuss this officially -- with all the nations of the Earth -- but I was not allowed the Opportunity. I have come to realize since that your mutual fears and suspicions are merely the normal reactions of a primitive society.  We know from scientific observation that you have discovered a rudimentary kind of atomic energy. We also know that you are experimenting with rockets.
That can easily be arranged.
I couldn't go to sleep, Mom. I had to tell you!
Honest, Mom, I saw him. It just opened up and he walked right in. And that great big iron man was moving around!
Yes, I have!
Gee, Mom, do you think maybe he's a diamond smuggler?
Boy, I'll bet he's strong. I bet he could knock down a whole building.
You're just kidding, aren't you?
Wouldn't you like to meet him?
Well, sure I would, but --  Aw, I'll bet you'd be scared.
Sure. Didn't you ever hear of Arlington Cemetery?
No -- I'm afraid not.
We'll finish it tomorrow... Goodnight, Bobby.
Their life expectancy is a hundred and thirty.
My name is Harley -- Secretary to the President  I've been told that you speak our language -- that your name is Mr. Klaatu.
It's rather difficult for us to think of another planet as a neighbor.
I was only hoping to make you understand.
My mission here is not to solve your petty squabbles. It concerns the existence of every last creature who lives on Earth.
Before making any decisions, I think I should get out among your people -- become familiar with the basis for these strange, unreasoning attitudes.
We're all set. I picked up some sandwiches and put gas in the car. And the radio's still busted, so me can forget about the space man for today.
Well, we could--
All right, Tom -- it's true. I know it's true.
Are you crazy? After what happened today?
But he isn't a menace! He told me what he came here for.
Is that what you're thinking about?
He has his homework to keep him occupied.
Just twelve.
No, wait a minute -- there's someone else.
No -- that is a power reserved to the Almighty Spirit.
How did you get in here? And what do you want?
Would you like to sell it?
Oh, I see. He was having trouble and you were helping him out.
But I suppose you know the answer.
How do you like Santa Carla?
Burn rubber does not mean <u>warp</u> <u>speed</u>!
Time to activate Plan B.
What?...
Leave him alone.
I will, David!
Or a vampire.
Are you guys sniffing old newsprint or something?
This is just our cover.  We're dedicated to a higher purpose.
He's not glowing.
Dad!  Don't sneak up on people like that!
Hi... I'm Laddie.
I'm tired now.
Wait a minute, kiddo.
Mom.  I think we've got to have a long talk about something?
Is it okay for the guest to see the food before the dinner?
He doesn't walk all over me.
No, no.  Just worrying about my boys -- as usual.
Then it's not too late for us...
It's not too late for you to be saved... but each night... it becomes harder and harder for me to resist killing...
Grandpa does not own a T.V.  Have you noticed?  There's no T.V. Santa Carla has no malls, no Cineplexes and now I won't even have MTV.  I will not know anything hip happening anymore.
Hey, Sam, we're flat broke.
You don't suppose Grandpa's an alien, do you?
I'm making you a sandwich.
What about Mom?
What do you want from us?
What was he doing in the rec room?
Don't know.  Looked for him for a bit... couldn't find him.
What the hell you looking at me like that for?
Sure.  You think there's a connection?
Now why'd you go and...
What?
Fuchs...?  No, it's not Fuchs... You must let me back in... I won't harm anyone... I promise...
What?
Why you so damn anxious to let him in here...
That key ring of yours is always hooked to your belt.  Now how could somebody get to it without you knowing?
What's happening?
But...
Well, who says I want you going with me?!
... Ever occur to the jury that anybody could have gotten to some of my clothes and stuck them up...
Could be important work.  Might as well bring it back.
A couple of hours.
Hey, man...!
Sanchez...?  Hey, who...
What kind of test?
We're going to draw a little bit of everybody's blood.
Get back!!
Calm down and get in your position.
Maybe it ain't coming.
Then we go after him.
Magnesium of some type... or some kind of strange alloy.  And those poor dumb bastards had to go and blow the hell out of it.
What's happened?!
It's in between us and them!!  How we going to get back?!
What else can they do?
There's a place that might help... we could try going there.
No...
What are you?
I was lucky.  The others weren't.
Regenerating fission reactor, you wouldn't understand.  It's power is well beyond your neanderthal cranial capacity.
We need your help.
When was his mother taken?
Last night.
This is the way in?
What's it all for?
This has to end.
I'm babbling.  Good to have someone to talk to for a change... But you need to go.  Take her out of here...  ... I don't have long.
I'll never forget this.
How?
We have lost the capacity to reproduce.  But the species must continue.
So you take their best...
When a creature shows too much independent thought we remove them from the gene pool.  We're breeding them for submission.  Soon they will be fully domesticated.
I've only read about them -- and the new internals.
I -- what are you?!
Why is it -- breaking up?
... Orion's belt, pointing to the earth.  You see it over the rocks there?  Sailors consider that an omen of good fortune; the hunter watching over them on their travels... Are you listening to me, Alex?
Emma, you know I have great... admiration for you.
A moonstone.
Alex, what is it?
They are rare...  ... Orion's belt, pointing to the earth --
She made the best Shepherd's pie I ever tasted.
All these clocks -- how can you constantly be running late?!
You care for me.  And you're concerned.  And I have to start living my life again.  I hear it from Mrs. Watchit every day.
Why don't you come to our house instead?
When's the last time you were outside this house --  -- or this room?
And this would be my study.  There was an elm tree outside the window then.
Did you hear me, lad?
Kalen will tire you out if you let him.  He's always been curious. His father was firm with him but... it's just his way.
You might find the truth rather hard to understand.
I'm going to sit with Kalen.  Keep the fire burning if you can.
I'll take you to your machine tomorrow.
You seem fascinated by the stars.
Every night.
This is magnificent...
And this is your "work"?
Want to be a high climber now, do you?
What's it all for?
Oh, very much...  ... I used to work somewhere in that direction, I think.  A huge university where we taught everything from botany to history to literature.
Oh very.  Learning, commerce, the arts -- the whole place was buzzing all the time.  Night and day.
You've welcomed me into your home. Into your lives.  Everyone has... For the first time in a long time it doesn't hurt quite so much.  I thank you for that.
Don't torture me -- do you have it?
Sir, that curriculum is forty years out of date.  The students today are looking toward the new century -- they want to be challenged and inspired, not spoon-fed dusty old equations that have been proved a thousand times.  They want to explore.
What are your people called?
We choose to believe it.
My fowl have polluted the yard.
You supported his application, Dr. Philby.  You are his senior, advisor.  I depend upon you to restrain his... excesses.  Any repetition of the behavior I witnessed in his classroom today and there will be consequences for you both.
What about Starks?
Don't get all worked up, Justin. I expected some common sense on your part and clearly I was expecting too much. [Beat] Just open the drawer.
I'm just looking at you. Does that make you uncomfortable?
We were forced to use restrains if that's what you're referring to.
Relax.
Don't act like I don't know what's real. [Beat] I'm not the one that's crazy here.
I had a patient a few years ago. His name was Ted Casey...
I don't give a shit about your patient!
Hello, William. I understand you've been asking for me almost every hour. I would've been here sooner but you gave our little state visitor quite a bit to talk to me about.
Getting away with things. Like whatever I may or may not have gotten away with Officer Harrison.
I'll say a prayer for you in Church today, Starks. Maybe the Gods can pick up where the medicine left off.
And what does that mean?
No. I'm not his son. I'm him. [Beat] What? You look like you've seen a ghost. You can come here and touch me, old man. I'm the real thing.
I know. [Beat] I knew that when you came out.
I don't understand...
That's right! Goddamn, you're the spitting image. I didn't know he had a son.
You done with your small talk?
This is really happening, isn't it?
I can't take you out of here in your condition...
His body was found on January 1, 1993, but do you know if that was long after he had died?
Hey, can you reach the gas pedal?
Dog tags. [Off her blank look] They've got your name and date of birth for identification.
What? Now you're gonna show me some kind of driver's license?
I know.
I have no idea.
You think Lorenson kills you?
That's all you got from him? That bastard helped take your life away from you.
I've been ok.
How you doin'?
Because Becker resigned after the charges brought against him by State Patient Advocacy Groups.
No. I don't want it to.
Exactly.
You don't understand.
Because I don't have time.
I tried to kill my wife.
Don't you go to jail for that?
Becker does? Are you sure?
Hey, Mister, you need a ride?
Where are you going?
Yup. That's me.
I'm asking you seriously, Sarah, a stranger?
I don't know, honey.  I guess it would depend.
Yeah, I could too.  But... I don't know why I'm even asking you this. It's just... we can't place anybody at the scene but these two gals that everybody swears is sweet as pie. I don't know.  I keep hearing words -- impossible -- inconceivable.  If just one person would say...
In the leg.
Now that you mention it, they might have been a little bit jumpy.
Hal, I've told you about twenty times, yes, I could identify 'em, but neither one of them was the type to pull something like this.
I have no problem with that.
We're going to leave someone here at the house in the event that she calls in.  Someone will be here until we find them.
Good God.
I guess I'm startin' to feel a little better.
So how come you don't have any kids?
Did you get married real young?
What did ya do?
I'm a robber.
I've always believed if done right, armed robbery doesn't have to be a totally unpleasant experience.
Jimmy!  Hello, stranger.  What in the world are you doin' here?
Hi.  I'm okay.  How are you?  Long time no see.
Louise, let me call you back after I wire it, so you'll know which office to go to.
I know.  Call me back.  Louise, I love you, okay?
Peaches.
Hello...
Okay, peaches, okay.  But can I ask you one thing?
Maybe.
Does it have something to do with another guy?  Are you in love with him?
Don't worry darlin'.  I'll say I never found you.  I'll say anything you want.  We'll find a way to get you out of this, whatever it is.
You wanna take it out of your wallet, please?
Am I in trouble?
He already thinks you're out of your mind, Louise, that don't carry much weight with Darryl.  Are you at work?
I haven't seen a place like this since I left Texas.
I'm sorry, Louise.  I know you're all upset.  It's just I'm so excited to be out of the house, I guess.  I wonder if Darryl's home yet.
I wonder if Jimmy's gotten back.
Oh my God.
We have to think this through.  We have to be smart.  Now is not the time to panic.  If we panic now, we're done for.  Nobody saw it. Nobody knows it was us.  We're still okay.  Now all we have to do is just figure out our next move.
Our next move?  I'll say one thing, Louise.  This is some vacation.  I sure am having a good time.  This is real fun.
That's puttin' it mildly.
Well, I'm not on drugs.  But I might be crazy.
Now you get a grip, Louise!  Just drive us to Goddamn Mexico, will ya!
No we shouldn't, but I want to put some distance between us and the scene of our last Goddamn crime!
You're disturbed.
What for?
I just told him if he ever gets to Mexico to look us up.  I asked him not to tell.  I didn't think he would tell anybody.
Now what?
Before.
I told you to slow down.  Hell, Officer, I told her to slow down.
Okay, okay... I've got some tequila. You want some tequila?
Nobody would believe us.  We'd still get in trouble.  We'd still have our lives ruined.  And you know what else?
I said all that?
Louise?
You're not gonna make some deal with that guy, are you?  I mean, I just wanna know.
No, Thelma.  I'm not gonna make any deals.
You awake?
It'd have to be pretty good.
What?
There's one thing you oughta understand by now, Thelma, it's not your fault.
You too, sweetie, the best.
I guess I went a little crazy, huh?
Where?!
What are you talkin' about?
We been seein' you all along the way.
Oh, Jesus!
I'll try to be more careful.
No harm, no foul?
Oh, Mary, honey, you're taking this all wrong.  I'm not leaving...
Stop it!
It must be great with a wife like that.
Whatever happened to Mary?
So that was it? One bump in the road and you gave up?
Relax, this guy owes me a big one. A couple years ago he got in a jam up in the Boston office; some bullshit about padding his resume -- like we haven't all done that. Anyway, they were going to let him go but his mother wrote a tear-jerker letter that ended up on my desk.
My Mary -- she's not in Japan, she's single, and she's got no rugrats. She does have a little gambling problem, she plays the football cards a bit too much, but she's a babe, a surgeon babe!
No You mean...?
The lazy fuck just didn't bother to look her up.
And this adversely affects me how...?
I don't know what to say.
A convention? How'd you see her at a convention?
What can I tell you? It's a healthier lifestyle down here, and it's easier to succeed when your head's clear. Those guys I worked with back in Boston, they were a bad influence.
Tell Bill to get the fuck off!
This is a light beer. You can't have a light beer?
Hello...? Sully...?  Sully, that you?
Uh, I'm fine. Just wanted to let you know I'll have your car back in a couple hours, I'm still staking out this girl's apartment.
Oh yeah.
Nepal? Have you been?
Same here again.
The museum? I thought we were going out to dinner?
A surprise?
Would you call that a portico or a vestibule?
You know, sometimes I wish I could be like Magda and not go home. I'd like to just bounce around for awhile, do a little traveling...
Harold and Maude is my all-time favorite movie.
Yeah... I guess this is it, huh?
I don't buy it.
No.
You want her dead, don't you?
So she's married?
Four kids, three different guys.
Three different guys?
Thanks, Healy. Good work.
Miami?
Yeah, this insurance business is too slow for me. I'm going to go down and try my hand at jai alai.
Jai alai?
All the same, I still want to call her. I know it sounds crazy -- Mary sure has a lot of troubles in her life -- but, I don't know, maybe I can help her out.  The poor thing's had it tough -- she's in a wheelchair for Godsakes.
Hey, hey, hey!
You fucked me, man? Why would you do that?
I'm talking about the letter, asshole.
You bet.
You what?
I mean I'm a fucking fraud. I'm no architect. Don't be a putz -- who's been to Santiago twice in a year?  Estadio Olimpico -- please!
I knew shit. The only thing I knew was that you were a fake and I made up everything else.  My real name's Norm. I deliver pizzas.
What line? The day you first laid your oily rap on my future wife you started a war!
Oh that makes a lot of sense. Why would I rat myself out?
I know how you feel -- I been standing in the same spot for the last five hours. You know it's against the law to pick up a hitchhiker in this state.
That must make it tough.
The exercise tape? Sure, I've seen it on T.V.
No, it should be 'a hockey player with great pecs.'
It means you're too hard on guys.
What? Steve seemed to put up with Warren.
You picked that up on the scanner. We gotta move.
Good lookin'?
Then why you going out with him if he's a schlep?
The point is, love isn't about money or social standing or age, it's about connecting with someone, having things in common kindred spirits.
Back when I was your age I always used to make myself a big banana split after sex. I think you're gonna need one tonight.
Where's Puffy?
I mean let's face it, Mary, you're beautiful, you've got money, you trust people -- I'm just saying, there's a lot of psychos out there.
I think you'd better sit down.
Don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give me a big head.  The important thing, Doctor, is you've got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off.
Oh. Okay. I gotcha.
Oh. So... what brings you down here?
Well good for you. I bet it works out for you.
Look, Mary, the truth is... I'll be in town for a while now but I don't think we should see each other for a few weeks.
Please leave.
Woogie and I went out for awhile in high school.
Really?
Yeah? What do you want?
Teddy, hon, are you okay?  OH HEAVENS TO PETE!
Okay.  So is that a yes or a no?
I believe the President made it clear that there would be no firing on ships without his express permission.
Yes, sir.
Did you have any indication of this from Georgi? Any possible warning or sense of motivation?
We're split down the middle. If I held a vote I think airstrike would beat blockade by a vote or two.
Well, I'm not.
He didn't have to worry about nuclear weapons.
They're going to be pressing for a military solution soon. We can't afford to let them ram their agenda down our throats. We need to come with options other than air strikes so we have some sort of choice here.
Helen and I went out for breakfast. EXCOM's not supposed to convene til eight.
And?
And the second condition?
-- I have the authority. I am the commander-in-chief of the United States, and I say when we go to war!
Don't forget, Mrs. Higgins wants to talk to you this afternoon about Kevin. You need to do something about this.
I want an hour with him.
I guess you won't be coming home tonight.
Get back out there, kid. Remember to hit 'em hard.
So what've we got today?
Still think Cuba isn't important?
Call me Irish, but I don't believe in cooler heads prevailing.
That's going to be tough. You know how these guys are about their chains of command...
I don't want to listen to this again.
Jesus Christ, O'Donnell, you're the one saying we need to move forward on a political solution.
Moving the line. Stroke of genius.
Dangle a settlement, tie us down in negotiations, we come up short...
Captain, force the sub to the surface for inspection.
Mr. President! We're receiving reports that the ships are stopping!
Just a second, Mr. President.
You're my hero, Carl.
What are you doing?
Your good friend Leo Fast Elk.
I know where I am. I'm on federal land, doing a federal investigation, and if you don't wanna cooperate you can take a ride in a federal car, and spend the rest of the day in a little room, answering federal questions. It's your call. Who are you?
I'm a full blood Oglala Sioux, born and raised on this reservation.
Hey, hey, hey. J. Edgar would've loved you. He'd love anybody who joined the bureau to, what was it? "To enforce the laws of my country and protect her interests"?
Go ahead.
Why we setting Eagle Bear up as an informant?
-- I know. I fed it, and I can't get rid of --
Bastards...
Sorry, Cooch. I lost Eagle Bear --
Big sonuvabuck. Based on the depth of that print, pressure releases... I'd say he goes two-ten, two-fifteen --
Is that right? Well, listen to this: drag your ass. This is a restricted area.
What was he saying?
You tell me. You tell me who went to the B.I.A. -- Bureau of Indian Annihilation and said I was messin' with your case, man. I don't give a goddamn about your case.
I'm a full-blood Oglala.
You take care.
X22. Read.
Go ahead, Ray.
I read, Cooch.
Do you want a coffee?
With an Indian representative out there, we hope to keep hostilities dormant; this is a COINTELPRO, Selective Operations Unit, and it'll be easier on Agent Couture if you can gain the people's trust and maybe --
At Sioux Falls Pen?
No, that was Leavenworth. This --  was Sioux Falls. What ya want?
Washington sent ya. I know that.
Get up out of the chair, Richard.
Get up out of the chair, and walk toward the backdoor, Richard.
How the hell do you know?
Well, it is. It is that, too.
Save you from a big mistake with that other guy.
I thought he'd never leave.
Two miles.
Yes. I'll give you that!
I thought there was something... That night in the club...
Maverick...you know the rules of engagement.
Don't worry, I'm a new strain. And I don't give up. Everything I've ever wanted I've had to work like hell for. Well, how about it?
You're an animal.
That's true. What are you?
You're horrible
You're totally insane.
I always wanted to fly... ever since I first saw a jet. I wanted to fly jets, then I wanted F-14's, then I wanted to fly off carriers, then I wanted Top Gun.
I'm still second best.
What do you want?
You look way out there. Out past the date line. West becomes East, all things change. You cross the line...today becomes yesterday...or tomorrow, I forget which.
What do you do when you come here?
Strip reality! How do you play that?
Looks like a tie.
Big talk for someone who's never been shot off her computer.
Oh...I'll think of something... What are you doing here?
I live here, remember?
One SIXTH the speed of sound!
Outside of this gate... I...am Top Gun.
I'M UP HERE TOO, MAVERICK.
I've got a six strobe.  I think he's locked on us.
Let's hope you're right!
That's missile lock!
What is?
What?  What is it?
You're not. We're level. Look at the instruments, we're okay!
It's crazy, man. Instruments are crazy. We're gonna have to eject.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IT DOESN'T GET TO LOOK MUCH BETTER THAN THAT?
I GOT ONE COMING UP.
No! Not again!
Just relax.
You hear that? Anything we want. Anything...Well???
Well what?
Why do you all have such funny names?
We won! Ice turns back, stares them down, then turns back into his locker, dismissing them.
I've lost him -- where is he?
Hi...Hi there. How ya doing in there?  Mav... Ahhh...you know, at one point I did want a Navy career.
STAY WITH HIM! TIGHTEN YOUR TURN!
I'm pinned to the panel.
That's because you don't have any women.
ICE, ROLL OFF, I CAN SHOOT HIM.
I don't know what to tell you, Skip.
He's seat of the pants... Completely unpredictable -- nothing by the book. All over the sky. But I don't know, Skip, he's really got something.
Three guesses.
What the hell you doing?
You didn't help.
Ahhh... Runs in the family, sir.
I wasn't thinking. I just did it.
It's my own way. It works for me. I don't care about the rest of that stuff.
How do you feel?
Goose is dead.
Or....
I don't know...
Why not?
I am Quaid.
They've got Quaid!  They're protecting him!
Kill him.
I'm with an very important client.
This is going to be very difficult for you at accept, Mr. Quaid.
Well, if this is my delusion, who invited you?
Bullshit.  It's all coincidence.
Where's Kuato?
Let me buy you a drink.
Harry, what the hell is this?
You blabbed, Quaid!  You blabbed about Mars!
Shit!
Welcome to JohnnyCab.  Where can I...?
Would you please repeat the destination?
The fare is eighteen credits, please.
Quit while you're ahead.
Harry from work...He was the boss.
You went to those brain butchers?!
--I got a trip to Mars.
I'm not your wife.
First of all, Doug, when you go Rekall, you get nothing but first class memories: private cabin on the shuttle; deluxe suite at the Hilton; plus all the major sights:  Mount Pyramid, the Grand Canals, and of course...  Venusville.
You.  You're the same.  No matter where you go, there you are. Always the same old you.  Let me suggest that you take a vacation from yourself.  I know it sounds wild, but it's the latest thing in travel. We call it an "Ego Trip".
Hauser?  You're Hauser.
Not bad, for a hooker.
What?
We were buddies in the Agency back on Mars.  You asked me to find you if you disappeared.  So here I am, good-bye.
Rhonda.  Rhonda LeBeck.  She's getting some kind of strange readings on her things.
How much you think?
I can't believe it.  No tracks, no sign, no spoor.
What the hell you doing back already?
Negative copy on that, Pham, check your frequency.  I'm on forty-nine.
Let's go you two.  We're headed for the mountains.
He'll never make it!  They're gonna get him!
You're really leaving, huh?
I keep thinking, if we were but half serious about money, we should quit being hired hands and...
Tammy Lynn Baxter.
Well, I'm a victim of circumstance.
Well, <u>you're</u> the one won't work in the car wash.  You're the one's gotta have a plan.
One job I'd never take is working around electricity.
This is one big mother!
Hey, Rhonda, you ever heard of <u>any</u>thing like this before?
Son of a god<u>damned</u> bitch!  Been waiting there all this time.  How the hell's it even know we're still here?
Run for it?  Running's not a plan. Running is what you do when the plan fails.  You're not even trying to come up with a plan!
I'm gonna kick his ass!
How the hell long it take <u>you</u> to change a tire?
Wait a minute...the Cat.  Could we take the Cat?
<u>I'm</u> best at driving the Cat.
Or just knock us over.  Look, use the bomb!
Road's in!
Fine, make the mistakes I did. I think I'll just be playing this hand myself.
How's she doing?
Burt!  Heather!
Val, we're going to have to forget about the truck...
You sure this is where it was?
Twenty.
Look, the situation hasn't changed. We still have to get to solid rock. There must be <u>some</u> way!
Our own Colombian Connection... For three years... Three years of ball breaking detective work. And we put a lotta bad guys behind bars.
That-a-boy. Hospital.
And the one on the right is the bullet you test-fired from Shu's gun?
Where's the nearest hospital?
I noticed.
"Art's Supplies" is founded on trust, Mister --
Hey -- the fact you popped Jimmy Chin in broad daylight proves it wasn't premeditated. Jury'll sympathize -- dude was banging your wife, right?
Not at all --
Right, I forgot... We're pledged to protect every mid-level drug dealer in the Tri-state area.  It's an awesome responsibility.
I don't venerate drug dealers, Roger. To the contrary.
So go take your job on Wall Street.
At the trial, you said you were at your apartment that night. Alone.
I didn't ask for a closing argument.
-- Yeah?
-- What?
I am. Eddie -- we've got nothing.
Beats getting paid in twenties by slimedogs selling angel dust to high school seniors.
So there goes your theory about the Joes giving up Shu to protect their trigger man.
I didn't put him in a wheelchair. Reynard did. He can get around without one -- it's all in my report.
Exactly what happened then?
About Chinatown. What went down.
How can I tell you what I don't know!
I didn't need to know that a man I'm defending on a gang-murder rap is a prison soldier who kills over drugs?
I did two tours in 'Nam...
Now maybe you got this case reopened because you see yourself as a thorn in society's side, or you want to walk into any restaurant in Chinatown and get free dumplings...
Friday's the drop-dead date on the offer.
Your Honor, that's trial by ambush!
-- alleged crime --
I'll take odds on Cecil Number Two.
...And you were at the trial to... to see that justice was done?
Look. Mister --
A Cubano army, basically... inside and outside prisons.
And its purpose?
I'm a soldado in the G-Wing Regiment.
By "takes care of," you mean "kills".
Mr. Stipe. A young man named Jimmy Chin was shot to death eight years ago, in Chinatown. Do you remember talking to the police?
The very fact that we are talking about word association means we are in a space that was opened up by our practice of word association. The world is a hologram, Albert.
That's not important. I will tell you what is important. The fan will soon be starting.
Get lost Bobby.
Don't get funny with me again.
Maybe not a thing, but maybe two things.
Sam, get the body and put it in the van.  Sheriff Cable, where were you the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
I am not going to Cliff's trailer.
Is that Agent Desmond's vehicle?
Got a couple of cups of coffee at Hap's from her. That's it. By the way where do you get off questioning a lawman? I could ask you the same question.
QUICKLY MEN... WORD ASSOCIATION, COOP. WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW?
Tell me about the letter.
And no one found the ring?
Someone else has it now.
He didn't suffer.
That was really something.  That dancing girl.  What did it mean?
Sort of shorthand.
The dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her. I noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in. It wasn't her dress or she must have lost some weight.
Accidental?
I think we should see the sun rise at the Canyon Trailer Park.
Take a look at this.
You didn't do your homework?
James called me last night looking for you.
Were you with Bobby? Or are you two still fighting?
Well, why not?
What is it Laura? What's wrong?
Laura, how about one friend for the rest of your whole life?
Donna, you are such a crack up. You don't even like Mike. Is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight.
Isn't tonight the night you are going to do it with Mike?
If I had a nickel for every cigarette your mom smoked, I'd be dead.
I won't wear your stuff.  I promise.
I can't remember anything about last night. Is there something I should remember?
No, you should forget about last night.
Laura, I am your friend.
You're not mad at me?
No.
I can't help you there.
Was I wearing something of yours and you got mad at me?
Why do you do it, Laura?
Fill 'er up.
Maybe.
You're on somethin' again, aren't you?
I can't tonight.
Say anything you want... I know you love me and I love you.
Shit, maybe he'll kill you.
What are you talking about? Bobby didn't kill anybody.
You want to see...
Hiking?
No.
History is on our side, Ben. It's no accident that the great explorers were named Hennepin, Nicollet, Marquette.
Sure honey, what's the hurry?
I had to see Bobby. I know you really don't like Bobby, but there was a problem and I didn't think you would understand.
Hi, honey, how's Donna?
A friend from school.
Dad... Dad... Who was that? How do you know him? He looked familiar. Have I met him?
Just sit here for a moment. You seem very upset.
Are you sure you're okay?
Laura. What's wrong this morning?
Leland, what are you doing?
You're right. There's no one here.
Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?
Nothing.
No. Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
It's a generous offer, Mr. Galvin...  ...nothing can make the woman well... but we try to compensate... to make a gesture...
To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
You are aware of the penalties for perjury...?
I wouldn't do it.
You would not...?
No.
Yes.
I...
You've just said you signed it.
That is correct. I was engaged to render an opinion.
Engaged to render an opinion. For a price. Is that correct? You're being paid to be here today?
...of Anesthesiology?
I'm on the staff of...
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
Yes.
Say it.
...I was one of a group of...
What did these people do when her heart stopped?
...We did everything we could...
You sure you don't want me to stay on.
What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle... her estate...
The hospital is owned by the Archdioceses of...
I've been meaning to come in a long time.
You live in the neighborhood?
Mrs. Simmonds.
Yes...
Yessir. I'm sorry.
Why is that?
What is it?
Nothing further, your Honor...
Still looking.
I changed my life today. What did you do?
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
Is this a bad time.
Why don't you get some rest?
You're going to stay here...?
That's not the question. It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault? If I'd... if I'd... I never should have taken it. There was no way that I was going to win.
Maybe I'll tell you later.
You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school...
You, you don't under...
Joe...  Joe...
No... no...
I can't guarantee that...
Pardon?
Yes, we know that you do. I have it in my files. That's at the Manhattan Health Center...
...we, we love her, Dick and me...
...I'm sure you do...
We, yes. Yes. They, they present their side, and I get the same chance. To cross-examine... to... to...
...now who is that...?
What?
Not bad...? This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick... And you calm down, all right? Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse... 'All these guys are God. I saw them walk on water...'  They had an obstetrical nurse in there. We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
I'm getting it back. Don't worry about me, Mick. I'm fine. D'you find the obstetric nurse?
You use their witness.
Uh... the admitting nurse...
What the hell are you doing here?
We got a mistrial, you know. Joe -- did you hear what I said...?
I just saw her.
Yes.
Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.  Jimmy, gimme another drink.  How are you?
Madrid has just blacked out!! Nothing more coming through.
I might have recognized you without the beard.  And you didn't wear glasses on the 'Time' cover!
I almost forget when I ate last.  It looks so good.... You know, mostly I get my meals in coffee shops and restaurants.
Nothing there now.
It was...  ...one of them!
I could wear it longer -- but it's less trouble this way.
A forlorn hope - but there is a chance.
No.  I thought you had them.
General Mann -- I was told to expect you, sir.  I'm Colonel Heffner.
Not all.  Radio is out.  But our field phones are okay so far.
But they're not human!  Dr. Forrester says they're some kind of an advanced civilization --
Who?  Where d'you think they come from!
I thought he'd stopped doing horror.
Just an earthquake, Dylan.  Every once in a while we get a few.
You've got to get back on the horse some time.  Look, you've had a nutcase making harassing phone calls.  I know how scary that feels.
You probably were half awake and saw me get nicked by that picture glass.  Dreams work like that.  You want me not to go on this job?
Chase.  Why didn't Chuck or Terry show up?
These look quite fresh.
DO you mind...
Someone's coming.
"Then their father covered them with kisses and they were safe."
Do you have to die to see God?
I honestly don't know. Try to sleep, baby.
Yes.  It's a story.  A story for a movie.
In what, a romantic comedy?
Must've read about the funeral.  Sick mother.  That's the last thing you need right now, I'm sure.
Wes won't show it until it's finished. That's what he told me, at least.  I asked him at the funeral.
What...happened?
Dylan.  And...  Chase.  My God, Wes, did you know?
Now that you have a child, is it possible you've decided horror is bad for children?
Uh...sure...when?
Did we lose anybody?
Do you remember the last time you and I danced under the stars?
I can take it.
Phil, he's not looking inside.  He's just striking out at the world.
So to all you sailors who've fought wind and whale...
Everyone aboard young Bill?
Everyone out of the rigging NOW!
How old are you, son?
What do you mean?
Where's Mom?
Yeah.
You okay?
Hey, shut up will ya?
God damn it man.  I think he broke my nose!
You only hurt yourself you know?
I gotta go.
Listen man, I think I have a problem.
That's how he died you know.
Northeast sir!
Remember something, sooner or later... we all have to face it.
Why do you think I'm sending him home?
I mean he has all these expectations and he doesn't even know who his own kid is.  What right did then have to show up here?
Then what do you think he was trying to do.
What's wrong, you don't like steak?
I think you were too hard on Weathers.
Son-of-a-bitch.
Immortality.
Spirits have a way of bringing that out.
And being sixteen.
They think we're carrying Cuban refugees.  Skipper, they mean to board us.
Hell, they even kicked me outa vo- tech 'cause I couldn't read a slide rule.
Me, too.
Jesus!  What the hell happened to him.
Because I felt like it.  What do you care?
How would you know?
What?  Come on...
What are we supposed to talk about?
You've gotta be kidding?
Fandango, Junior.  I'm gonna do some limbo baby!!
Yes, that's true.
What's that supposed to mean?!
Artie? That you, Artie?
How ya feelin', Artie? I heard you wasn't doin' too well recent.
Meetin' him at the gate. That phone call this afternoon was the signal. My deranged mama's hid the keys to my car. But of course, I know exactly where they are.
Hey, pretty woman... Sailor here?
No way... GET OUT!!!
Need a hand?
You black?
Have now.
The cobra's waitin' to strike, chica.
What's the name of it?
Hey!!!... Johnnie Farragut. How are you, my man.
Real good, Chet... It's been awhile.
Everythin's relative. Where's that Marietta Pace Fortune? You two didn't split up, I hope.
No sir...
Not for lack of love, I can tell ya that.
If your neighbors didn't mind, how'd you get put out of business?
The same to you. If you are in Honduras, come to the Bay Islands and visit us. The Hondurans are great friends of the American people. But I have a joke for you before I go. If a liberal, a socialist, and a communist all jumped off the roof of the Empire State Building at the same time, which one of them would hit the ground first?
He served his time for what he did. Another thing... If Lula went with him of her own volition - willingly, that is - there ain't much can be done about it.
Well stop worryin' about me and start worryin' about how you're gonna get that Lula back here and away from that murderer.
I'm stayin' right here by the phone until you find Lula, then I'm comin' to get her. You call soon's you got somethin', even if it's three in the a.m.
No, you wait right there for me... I'll be on the Piedmont flight tomorrow at seven. Meet me at the airport.
Who was that?... Who know's your here?
Johnnie, I can't tell you, honey. Is there anyway we can get on the road tonight? We've got to find them kids.
That bastard Pucinski...
Did I tell ya it's great to see ya again?
Damn it, child! Now look what you made me do.
Nothin', honey.  Mama's just actin' strange.
'Bout fifty thousand times. I got us a room at the Cape Fear, and guess what?... I hear Powermad's at "The Hurricane."
Well, I was thinkin' about smokin' actually... My mama smokes Marlboros now, used to be she smoked Kools? I stole 'em from her beginnin' in about sixth grade. When I got old enough to buy my own, I bought those. Now I've just about settled on Mores, as you probably noticed? They're longer.
Hell, you just rubbed up against the wrong girl is all.
Twenty-three months, eighteen days is all. Don't need to make more'n it was.  This couple's goin' on a date to Hawaii. The girl chose him over the other two guys.
Oh, you know exactly what I mean, honey? It'd make the future so simple and nice.
Hell, peanut...
Prob'ly the rain boys from Outer Space.
Sound like ol' Dell's more'n just a little confused, peanut... Too bad he couldn't visit that ol' Wizard of Oz and get some good advice.
One thing puzzles my mind, sugar... You're twenty years old - aren't you ever curious why your mama has this fixation on keepin' us apart? Puttin' a detective on us. I'll tell ya Lula... Well... It's more'n me killin' Bob Ray Lemon...
What'll it be like in California, Sailor, do you think? I hear it don't rain much there.
I H-A-T-E hotel bedspreads. They don't hardly never get washed, and I don't like the idea of lyin' on other people's dirt.
What's that, honey?
You got me, peanut.
Recall the time we was sittin' one night behind the Confederate soldier? Leanin' against it. And you took your hand and put it on your heart and you said, 'You feel it beatin' in there, Lula?... Get used to it, 'cause it belongs to you now.' D'you recall that?
We didn't do nothin' special I can remember. Just talked, is all.
Boy, sweetie, this is weird, okay.
You don't feel you was a little hard on the guy, honey?
I wouldn't mind a little night life. How about you?
More'n likely.
I was just wastin' time, peanut, till you come back.
Under a hundred.
Sure is a big deal round here... Alamo Road, Alamo Street, Alamo Square, Alamo Buildin', Alamo Alamo. They ain't forgettin' about it in a hurry. That's the thing 'bout memory? Some things you wish you could forget... What's troublin' you, sugar?
Well, there's a good side as well as a bad side to it... The good side is I knew your daddy, and I thought Clyde was a good ol' guy...
Oh God, Sailor.
You think she's gonna make it?
Well, it ain't exactly Emerald City...
You find any work?
You sick?
Love you, too.
Yeah... He was lookin' for you.
Oughta make 'em happy.
Uh-huh?
What're you talkin' about? That's your son in there.
I'll bet.
In the Ganges near Varanasi to try and reduce human pollution and now plan to put in the crocodiles to devour floatin' corpses dumped by Hindus too poor to pay for cremation.
No, mama, I'm in Mexico, and we're about to get on an airplane to Argentina!
No, baby, don't! Can I send you somethin'? You runnin' low on money? I'll wire you some money if you tell me where you are.
What time's Sailor's train get in?
Got any plans?
Figure we'll go have supper someplace. Maybe get some barbecue out by Stateline. Sailor always liked that Havana Brown's Pig Pickin'.
What if I told you not to?
Perhaps we should call a local law enforcement officer.
I knew you'd want it again...
Take care of him?
What does take care of him mean? Do you want me to give him food or some clothing?
Santos, why in hell do you insist on playin' this stupid game?
Shoot him? Like with a gun?
Where?
Where we goin'?
Got word the kids are moving through Texas... I think an ending is being arranged there... Come on, lemme see a smile.
Well, Johnnie told me you used to drive for Clyde and Santos...
Sure... I figured I'd see you sometime...
You really are one dumb asshole.
It's the Chancellor.
You're stoned.
She's still a transvestite.
Trip??
Vernon, then. Vernon Hardapple. The scar's are from a -- from a horse. He fell during a race and got trampled.
And now he's addicted to painkillers.
That was good.
Nothing, he's just been sort of, I don't know... kidnapped.
Such as.
I passed out.
How long have you been having them?
Spiro T. Agnew was vice president, I believe.
Better luck next time.
So is my friend... is Sara still here?
You've got a gun, motherfucker. Drop it!
Who the hell is that?
Let me get this straight. All that paper that went into the river. That was the only copy?
Right. Well, thanks. For the lift.
No sweat. Only do me a favor?
It's just... for good luck. Some people carry rabbits' feet...
Sounds like a good one.
So what are you doing out here?
They're glass. The buttons.
Pretty good. I'm friends with Dr. Gaskell, too.
Want me to get that?
How's that?
So where have you been staying?
Maybe...
Colon cancer.
Outside Scranton.
When we fall, we fall hard.
But, last night...
I'm sorry.
I eat.
Ail right. By the way, his friend...?
James. This is my editor, Terry Crabtree.
He shot the Chancellor's dog, didn't he? The blind one.
Crabtree? He doesn't even know James.
The aunt, Hannah. Where did you take James that day?
She's left before...
You had another one, didn't you? You have to see a doctor, Grady. First thing Monday morning. All right?
Not have it.
I can't believe you hung up on me, you dick.
Hub? Oh, well, that's part of what I need to...
Did you pass out again, Grady? Did you fall somewhere?
No, I don't think you do. And besides... I haven't decided yet.
Oh?
I'm not very happy with you right now, Grady. But more importantly, Walter's not very happy and he's gotten the police involved. They seem to think James Leer is somehow responsible for all of this. You wouldn't happen to know where James is, would you, Grady?
Are you sure you parked it there?
He told you.
That perfume you're wearing, Antonia. It wouldn't happen to be Cristaile, would it?
Couldn't he have just thrown a shoe at the poor thing?
Walter?
It's Grady, Walter.
I know it's you, Grady, I just... Christ, Grady, do you know what time it is?
Oh?
No. I guess you're here for the backpack.
Where you stand?
She's in Philadelphia seeing Linda Aahby. The neurologist.
I doubt I'd recognize a '63 Chateau Latour if I was sitting on it.
Well, Q certainly will. And, given that he will be addressing 500 people in little over an hour...
Took some talking to convince your super I was a relative.
Yeah, you still with Northland?
No shit.
Five years.
When can I see her?
I don't know. She won't talk about it.
I'm just talking, man.
What are you looking at?
Birds.
A solitary vireo. I like that one.
Their sound is quite musical.
You live around here?
Do you come here often?
My daddy likes me home before dark.
Okay?
You walked home.
Fairy tales?
I suppose if you're looking for a male between the ages of thirty and fifty, medium height, medium weight, medium build. Probably not too many men fit that bill.
But you are taking it?
Have you seen Walter?
Yeah, like the bird.
Would you like to sit on my lap?
That's okay... doesn't matter.
What's her name?
I can't.
What?
Reflect.
How's that?
Honest? Your cheery personality makes my skin itch.
Maybe it's the way I look. Or the sound of my name.
Rosen? I don't have a problem with that.
Because if you did, I know a therapist named Ryan. I also know a therapist named Chung.
Have you talked to Carlos about your concerns?
I couldn't say.
Do you know what "normal" is?
What did you want to happen?
Of course it is! That's why I'm telling you!
You're very late.
No, I am not going to --
Nothing. Can I open my eyes?
Sorry.  Where is she?
We're little kids.
All right.
Want a ride?
What's weird about that?
Southern light.
You must hate it.
I get that impression.
I didn't say I didn't enjoy it.
No you're not.
Why do you want to know?
Depraved? My mistake.
I'm sorry, Walter.
Being here, with me.
Which brother did this?
Who doesn't?
What's this?
What's your fucking problem?
Yeah.
Right through the brainpan.  Deader'n dogshit, boss.
Okay, good reason.  Then what?
Nice shot, Lins.
What's goin' on, Boss?
Deep and slow, big guy.  Deep and slow.  Just breathe easy.
Okay, Jammer.  No problem.  You stay right here. I have to go there to the end... you'll see my lights.  We'll stay in voice contact.  Just hold onto the rope.  Five more minutes.  Okay?
Yup, a Benthic Petroleum paid for it.  So as long as they're hold the pink slip, I go where they tell me.
You need me.  Nobody knows the systems on this rig better than I do.  What is something was to go wrong after the Explorer clears off?  What would have you done?
I think you were worried about me.
What are you still wearing that for?
I'll tell you what happened... you woke up one day and realized the guy never made you laugh.
Fine.  Be that way.
No.
You totaled it, huh?
Okay... okay.  We gotta get you out of here.
What, you growing gills all of a sudden?  You got it on, keep it on.
We'll take reading as we go.  If the reactor's breached or the warheads have released radioactive debris, we'll back away.  Simple.
We'll go in through that large breach.
Got it. Over.
Look, we've all made chamber runs to this depth. We're checked out.
Cab One, radiation readings?
I want 'round-the-clock manning of the sonar shack and the exterior cameras.  We need early warning if the Soviet craft try another incursion.
You've got some huevos bringing this... thing... into my rig!  With everything that's been going on up in the world, you bring a nuclear weapon in here?  Does this strike anyone as particularly psychotic, or is it just me?
Deepcore, Deepcore... this is Cab Three on final approach.
No.  Just you and me.  We get some proof, then tell them.  Hippy, look... if was can prove to Coffey it's not Russians, maybe he'll ease off the button a little.
Uh, oh...
Stand by on the ROV.
High-Pressure Nervous Syndrome.  Muscle tremors, usually in the hands first.  Nausea, increased excitability, disorientation.
When do you have to go back?
Anna... Maybe it would be better to wait a while.
There will be plenty of time to talk about it later.  We'll  get married  soon.  That way we'll have more time...
But you just said that a month was too...
I'm thirsty.
Did you sleep well?
This one is gorgeous.
I presume by this method that you'll be able to uncover some new clue, either a handkerchief or an article of clothing... In other words, something which your men have not been able to find as yet.
What is that one over there called?
At what?
There's no comparison.
I have a feeling that you're not used to being alone.
And yet, she seemed to feel that our love for her -- mine, yours, even her father's, in a certain sense -- weren't enough for her, or didn't mean much to her.
Oh, Sandro...
I think the only way to help ourselves, Claudia, is for us to be together.
Claudia, listen to me...
Promise that you won't try to look for me... you shouldn't try to look for me any more...
Then why do you say them?
You look at me as though I had said something foolish...
And you leave me here all alone... in this hotel room...
But you know it already. Why must I tell you?
Why?
Did the hotel manager speak to you about that place nearby?
Sandro, listen... Try not to get yourself too involved tomorrow.
To do what?
It's divine!
You say that just to flatter me.
Do you consider that a compliment?
Patrizia... Patrizia ... Where's Ettore?
Patrizia, I'm afraid.
But for what reason should I come there?
Nothing, nothing  at all. I was just looking for Sandro.
Giulia, don't you understand that the more involved you become with people, the more difficult it is to speak with them?
It's strange how anxious women are to display themselves. It's almost a natural inclination.
Answer me, why don't you try posing? I'll paint you a beautiful portrait.
Yes, sir. My sister is sick... and my father, too.
And who is she? Does she work in Catania?
Very well. First of all, I'll have them search the waters around the island. I brought two frogmen with me... Meanwhile, we'll take a look up around here.
Another thing; there's an old man who lives here on the island...
Raimondo... Do you enjoy fishing underwater?
I would like to ask you something.
I read one of your articles regarding the disappearance of a girl. I'm that girl's fiancâ€.
Agnes, it has come to my attention that you have stopped eating. Why is this? AGNES  I've been commanded by God.
He talked to you Himself?
Why does it matter whether you're fat or not...
I do, I have to be attractive to God.
Who told you this?
Christ said it in the Bible, he said - suffer the little children, I want to suffer like a little child.
No... I mean... I mean look at these. I've got to lose weight, I'm a blimp.
God blew up the Hindenburg. He'll blow me up, that's what she said...
Nonsense, I'm your mother now and I want you to eat.
You've got to eat something Agnes.
Why?
I don't know... I don't know...
I don't know.
Anything... may I sit down?
Second thing that comes to your mind.
Have you ever loved anyone?
Well, who in particular?
Agnes, have you ever loved another man... other than, Jesus Christ?
Well do you love... do you love Father Martineau?
At least once a week.
And you like that?
Something I ate.
Yes.
The baby they made up.
Where'd it come from before that?
Yes I do,  but I want you to...
Martha Louise Livingston.
I've stopped menstruating
Sister Paul was in her eighties?  Did she climb up here often?
No, only when she felt like it. She brought me up here last winter and the next day she died.
No wonder... wait... Agnes... Agnes how do you feel about babies?
Where did you go?
Oh, no place as wonderful as this. Agnes... have you ever thought of leaving the convent for something else?
I don't know.
Did you ever want to be a mother yourself?
Agnes, how did your mother get you?
I can't help it if I'm stupid.
... that you don't remember getting pregnant...
What did you do?
Yes?
... makes me...
She tells you you're ugly?
And that you're stupid?
Are you intelligent?
But it's easy. It's just a breath with sound. Say it. What kind of trouble?
How did you have a baby?
Why?
Why?
Did anyone else know about the baby?
Will she be angry?
I'm afraid.
I ate.
Hm hmm. What did you have for dinner?
What is it?
For me to get sick in.
Yes.
Who?
She said Michael.
So she sent you?
No...
It was dead.
Yes.
I gave you the pictures Marty, what else do you want?
I don't know.
Thanks. 
You have proof?
Hello, Mama  ... brought you something.
No-one.
Could there have been anyone else?
She can't even remember the birth. Do you think she'd admit to the conception?
I am not with the Inquisition.
From other nuns...  Yes I... I've noticed.
In her case it isn't. She's had very little schooling. Her mother kept her home almost all the time and when her mother died Agnes came here, to us. She's never been out there Doctor. She's never seen a movie or a television show. She's never even read a book.
This was before her pregnancy?
Nuns... you hate nuns.
I'm only interested...
???   ... virginity, right Mother?  Poverty, chastity and ignorance is what you live by.
Then help her.
I never saw Agnes until she set foot in this convent. My sister ran away from home. We lost touch with her. And when my husband died and I came here, she wrote to me and asked me if I would take care of Agnes in case anything happened.
Do you know what she did to her?
Because I didn't know... 
Catholic Church doesn't have a corner on morality...
That's all?  That's enough!  She was a beautiful little girl.
I wasn't. I wasn't. She was the pretty one. She died, why not me?  I never said my morning prayers. And I was ugly, I was scrawny, I had buck teeth and freckles all over my face, do you know what the nun called me, Sister Mary Clitus, called me Polkadot Livingston.
I'm out of prac...  ... practice. 
All right?
Mary Magdelen?
Of course.
She is an innocent.
This is permission to take her apart.
Hasn't she had enough?
I have a few more questions to ask her.
Who knew she was pregnant?
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
You went to the room to help with the birth.
I wanted her to have it when no-one else was around, they would have taken the baby to a hospital and left it with them, but it was such a difficult birth, there was so much blood and I panicked.
That's enough.
Agnes, what happened to the baby?
Yes, they were playing the queues outside the picture palaces of Liverpool. Scruffy young lads, lacking even the price of a jam roll. Orphans, every Paddy's son of 'em. I saw their potential at once although I had me doubts about the little fella, a savage primitive, that Ringo, but it was him what gave in first. He picked up a brick and heaved it at me and I quelled him wid one fierce flash of me eyes. "Mister, can you spare us a copper?" he said. I was disarmed by the grubby little outstretched mauler ... So, I took them under me managerial banner.
Oh, not at all, I let them have twenty-five; sure aren't there four of them?
Are you now?
Not much cop without 'em, is it?
I'm a deserter, too.
Boys, you don't know what this means to me. If you hadn't come back it would have been the epilogue or the news in Welsh for life.
Leave them drums alone.
Ever seen one of these before?
I've made the scene.
He doesn't like me, honest, I can tell ... It's 'cos I'm little.
You do - repeatedly.
I mean lines, ducky, can you handle lines?
I'll have a bash.
Oh, you mean that posh bird who gets everything wrong?
Gerron.
Aye and we'll have to watch it and all.
No. I mean, it's probably a honeymoon couple or a company director or something.
Is he?
It's Paul's grandfather.
Well ... go 'head, do the next bit.
Go away! You've spoilt it.
Aye, I knew you were.
What's that mean?
I bet you don't sound like real people.
Well, look at it this way, I mean, when you come right down to it, that girl, she's a bit of a scrubber, isn't she?
Pity.
And that lot's never happier than when they're jeering at you ... and where would they be without the steady support of your drum beat, I'd like to know.
You ugly, great brute you, you have sadism stamped all over your bloated British kisser.
I'll go on a hunger strike. I know your caper. The kidney punch and the rabbit-clout. The third degree and the size twelve boot ankle-tap.
Yeah ... so what?
What little old man?
Aye, that's what I'm afraid of!
Gie's a kiss!
Give 'em a pull.
Gaw, it's depressing in here, isn't it? Funny...  'cos they usually reckon dogs more than people in England, don't they? You'd expect something a little more palatial.  Come on. Let's have a little action. Let's do something, then.
You needn't bother.
Leave him alone, he's got swine fever.
No, you look here, John. I've only one thing to say to you.
Oh, wait a minute, don't tell me you're ...
Oh you are, I know you are.
You are.
Oh do I? You're the first one who ever said that.
Is it?
What have you heard?
It'll only get you into trouble.
I knew it, <U>he</U> started it, I should have known.
Have <U>you</U> lost him?
Aren't we ...
None for me, then?
What do you think are you're up to?
Look after him.
Do I have to raise me voice?
Nerves.
Course he can talk. He's a human being, like. Isn't he?
What's the matter with you? You were bashing away like a madman.
I'll set John on you!
Hell, we're equipped --
What's the terrain down there?
Well, line of sight is impossible due to dust.  Radar gives me noise. Sonar gives me noise.  Infrared -- noise.  Let's try ultraviolet.  There. Flat.  It's totally flat.  A plain.
I'm sending.  Do you hear me?
Don't you remember?
Computer, this is Captain Standard. What conditions are you talking about?
I have intercepted a transmission of unknown origin.
What?  <u>Why</u>?
Unknown!  What do you mean?
Yes!
Just a minute, hold it, I'm checking.
The computer's translated the alien signal, and it's kind of alarming.
What happened?  Where's Sandy?
Martin, this is Jay.  The intakes are clogged with dust.  We overheated and burned out a whole cell.
Hey, guess what?
This dust is getting clogged in the intakes again!
It's a crude symbolic language -- looks primitive.
Hey now, what is this?
There.  Should be coming through about there.
He's running a fever.
Still unconscious?
We can't pump poison gas down into the cooling unit!  It'll flood the whole ship!
That's right -- we can't kill it on the ship, but we can at least keep it at bay -- and maybe drive it into the air lock.
I don't buy that.  There's still time to destroy it and get ourselves in the freezers.
Should we go outside and bring him in?
We're not going anywhere.
How many?
It's some kind of organ -- it's inserted some kind of tube or something down his throat.
What's happening up here?
This is horrible.
You mean his body was still kicking when it ran off with him?
Recognizable!  In that?
We can use the flamethrower.
Is it armed?
Just settle down.  Sandy, you get any response yet?
That's the one about the albatross, right?
They're on the next level up.
Source of transmission is to the northeast... about 300 meters.
Where are we?
Let's hear it.
Yeah, okay. 
Any microorganisms?
I don't even know what I'm looking for.
I'm sorry to say it looks like you were right in the first place, Martin.  We never should have landed here.
Look, I'm not trying to rub anybody's nose in anything.  The important thing is just to get away from here as fast as possible.
Engaged.
We made it!  Damn, we made it!
This stuff's deadly -- I hope we know what we're doing.
Are you <u>crazy</u>?
Two down, four to go.
Poor kitty; puss puss puss.
But the lifeboat can't accelerate to light speed.
No, it won't work and I just realized why.  There's only one hypersleep freezer on the lifeboat. Only one of us could survive.
What did it do to you?
I'll get you out of there.
No... don't...
Minh...
I found it...
How much air-time have I got?
Deal.
If I can get to the chopper, I'll meet you at the rendezvous.  Don't wait for me.
One more sweep... one more sweep.  I'm getting tired of one more fuckin' sweep. We're been lookin' for this thing for three days now, and found zip.
Whoa, wait a minute...
Okay.
And...?
Not too much of the socializing type, then?
And what is your name?
Phoebe.
I call myself Phoebe.
You're more than modest.
Please do.
Even if I wanted to - as you say - be less humble, blow my own horn... how would I do it? I'm less than nobody.
Let's have a minimum of pretending. I'll want to do a column about you-
Just some coffee.
Nothing of the kind. Karen and I had a nice talk.
Heart to heart? Woman to woman? Including a casual reference to the part of "Cora" - and your hopes of playing it.
Just like that.
Stop rehearsing your column... Isn't it strange, Addison? I thought I'd be panic-stricken, want to run away or something. Instead, I can't wait for tonight to come. To come and go...
Suites are for expense accounts. Aren't you being extravagant?
We're?
There never was, there'll never be another like you.
Very well, plainly and distinctly. Although I consider it unnecessary - because you know as well as I, what I am about to say.  Lloyd may leave Karen, but he will not leave Karen for you.
Everything. Because after tonight, you will belong to me.
Belong - to you? That sound medieval - something out of an old melodrama...
You're too short for that gesture. Besides, it went out with Mrs. Fiske.
A matter of opinion. Granted. It is also true that you worked in a brewery. But life in the brewery was apparently not as dull as you pictured it. As a matter of fact, it got less and less dull - until you boss's wife had your boss followed by detectives!
Why not?
Max has gone to a great deal of trouble, it's going to be an elaborate party, and it's for you.
Exactly.  Here. Take it to the party instead of me.
Tell me this. Do they have auditions for television?
Miss Caswell got lucky too late. The audition is over.
How... how was Miss Caswell?
Frankly, I don't remember.
Margo, as you know, i have lived in the Theater as a Trappist monk lives in his faith. I have no other world, no other life - and once in a great while I experience that moment of Revelation for which all true believers wait and pray. You were one. Jeanne Eagels another... Paula Wessely... Hayes - there are others, three or four. Eve Harrington will be among them...
I take it she read well.
The implication being that I have not been reading them as written.
Bill...
Forty-five minutes from now my plane takes off and how do I find you? Not ready yet, looking like a junk yard-
When - when are you coming back?
Wait a minute! You can't hang up, you haven't even said it-
She did...?
Yeah... I will.
Need any help?
Don't let me kill the point. Or isn't it a story for grownups?
I can't believe you're making this up - it sounds like something out of an old Clyde Fitch play...
Of course it's funny - this is all too laughable to be anything else. You know what I think about this - this age obsession of yours - and now this ridiculous attempt to whip yourself up into a jealous froth because I spent ten minutes with a stage-struck kid-
You know nothing about feelings, natural or unnatural.
It's all over.
What's all over?
Gone.
I will not calm down!
I'm trying terribly hard.
Such nonsense, what do you all take me for - little Nell from the country? Been my understudy for over a week without my knowing, carefully hidden no doubt-
Now don't get carried away-
I'll say.
Just being happy? Just stopping all this nonsense about Eve - and Eve and me?
But if I tell you it is - as I just did. Were you listening to me?  Isn't that enough?
Why.
Then why? Why, if you're the best and most successful young director in the Theater-
I'm talking about you. And what you want.
Then face it. I have. Since that first night - here - in the dressing room.
What did you expect - live sables?
There are some human experiences, Birdie, that do not take place in a vaudeville house - and that even a fifth-rate vaudevillian should understand and respect!  I want to apologize for Birdie's-
Something maybe grew a size bigger.
An answer.
Now you want an argument.
Well... let's say she thinks only about you, anyway...
Who are you?
About how you live, what kind of clothes you wear - what kind of perfume and books - things like that. You know the Eve Harrington clubs - that they've got in most of the girls' high schools?
How'd you get all the way up here from Brooklyn?
Not at all.
You're Margo Channing's best friend. You and your husband are always with her - and Mr. Sampson... what's he like?
You see the play? You've seen the play every performance?  But, don't you find it - I mean apart from everything else - don't you find it expensive?
But if I'd known... maybe some other time... I mean, looking like this.
I don't let myself think about it, even-  - but I do know the part so well, and every bit of the staging, there'd be no need to break in a new girl-  - but suppose I had to go on one night? To an audience that came to see Margo Channing. No, I couldn't possibly...
I won't forget.
Do you expect me to believe that you didn't say any of those things - that they were all Addison?
Eve... don't cry.
Tell me. How did your lunch turn out - with the man from Hollywood?
Eve. I - I don't think you meant to cause unhappiness. But you did. More to yourself, perhaps - as it turned out - than to anyone else...
I'll never get over it.
If you told him so, he'd give me the part. He said he would.
Well - if I'm not in the way...
What - again?
I mean the performance. Except for you, you'd think he'd never even directed it - it's disgraceful the way they change everything around...
You haven't noticed my latest bit of interior decorating...
Don't bother. Mrs. Brown'll be along for it in a minute.
Right here.
Good evening, Mr. deWitt.
... and if you'd come in the middle, I'd have stopped, I couldn't have gone on-
Hi.  Hello, darling-
Autograph fiends! They're not people - those little beast who run in packs like coyotes-
Harrington.
Would you like a drink? It's right beside you...
Roughly ten minutes.
It seems to me that walking, for most people, is not very dangerous.
Margo. Bill is all of eight years younger than you.
Those years stretch as the years go on. I've seen it happen too often.
I don't suppose the heater runs when the motor doesn't?
About Eve. I've acted pretty disgracefully toward her, too.
Well...
In this rat race, everybody's guilty till they're proved innocent! One of the differences between the Theater and civilization...  ... what gets me is how all of those papers in town happened to catch that particular performance!
But not right away? First the business of fighting them off, chin up, stout fella...
I remember.
Then a childish, heavy-handed routine about not knowing Eve was her understudy-
Of course she knew! For one thing, Addison told her how superbly Eve had read the part-!  Karen, let me tell you about Eve. She's got everything - a born actress. Sensitive, understanding, young, exciting, vibrant-
You know, I've been going over our financial condition - if you'll pardon the expression...
Eve would ask Abbott to give her Costello.
Lloyd Richards, you are not to consider giving that contemptible little worm the part of "Cora."
Such as?
Well of all-
Three days, that's for the bourgeois - I see a midnight elopement, waking up a village person...
You mean - all this time - she'd done nothing but apologize? What'd you say?
Who is it? What's it all about?
Honey chili had a point. You know, I can remember plays about women - even from the South - where it never even occurred to them whether they wanted to marry their fathers more than their brothers...
That was way back...
Not exactly. Sometimes, though, I wish I understood you better.
When you do, let me in on it.
"Cora." She's - still a girl of twenty?
Don't you think it's about time it became important?
... as young as they want, you mean. And I'm not interested in whether thousands of people think I'm six or six hundred-
Eve? Eve, my understudy? But I had no idea...
How fortunate that I have an understudy so ready, so willing and so able to go on.
... and Bill. Especially Bill. Eve did that, too.
Look, Miss Channing... it's kind of depressing. If you don't mind my saying so, everybody's kind of dying on the vine...
Margo. You by any chance got bicarbonate of soda in the house?
The situation I'm in ain't the kind you can belch your way out. I made a promise...
I tell you what. Why don't I read with her?
You get quick action, don't you?
--I have to stand here and listen to the staff correspondent from Virginia?--
--what have you been here, nine months?--I been in this business since I was sixteen--
July of '71.
Goddamnit--
It's not us, they were scared before we got there.  What do we know?
Facts or theory?
I hate both parties.
--we've got to find out who the five guys are--the five with access to the slush fund--they were aware of the break-in.
How do you want to handle Sloan?
Think Sloan's back?  What's wrong?
--if we could name the guys got the reports, we'd be ahead again--
The burglary was done by Cubans or Democrats or Republicans.
Now the reason no one believed the Republicans is because there wasn't any reason, they were so far ahead. But Segretti was talking to these other lawyers a year before the break- in.
So maybe Watergate wasn't really about Watergate--maybe that was just a piece--
Segretti criss-crossed the country over ten times in six months--and never stayed anyplace over a night or two.  Switch to another station, huh? You're driving me crazy with that.
You think this was Clawsen's initiation?
Hmm?
I'll never get out of here in time.
Oh, the scuttlebutt for awhile was he was investigating Kennedy--
I'm so glad.
And you will.  But not now.
Mr. Dardis does call in every so often?
I didn't do anything wrong.
Chapin did contact you then?
--there's nothing new in it--
Absolutely--
You're two months behind--you got enough to cover?
Anyplace really public, they'd know about it--they know everything at the Committee, Carl--
You were Hugh Sloan's bookkeeper when he worked for Maurice Stans at Finance, and we were sort of wondering, did you go work for Stans immediately after Sloan quit or was there a time lapse?
...No... never in so many words...
Who were they?
That's another of the things I'm not so sure of.
I will not talk about the other two.
What happens when the baby comes?
--that leaves Haldeman, period.
--I'm not here.
Absolutely--Marilyn's gotten it totally wrong--
Well, was it in a bar, her apartment, some restaurant--
I did everything you said, but it all seemed--
In my day, it was simply called the double cross. I believe the CIA refers to it as Mindfuck. In our context, it simply means infiltration of the Democrats.
Yes, the little ratfuckers are now running our government.
Mitchell knew then.
Security consultant.
Where?
We're going to need lots of good luck, aren't we?
--well, I've got some pretty experienced fellas sitting around, wouldn't you say so?--
The head of security for the reelection of a Republican President got caught bugging the national offices of the Democrats? What the hell does that mean?
Thanks, Harry.  Know anything about Colson?
Could develop.
Anyone but Bernstein.
I don't get it--you were the one who wanted to fire him.
You think she wants us to ease up on the story?
A boy or a girl?
--I already get the Post. I don't need another subscription.
Perhaps you should consider actually answering an ad.
You're just gonna sit there and drink your coffee?
...Nevermind.  You have anything to drink?
Mister Finch -- are you trying to seduce me?
This is your plan, Finch?
What do you suppose they're saying?
Of course, I didn't --
Oh, please.  I asked you because I thought you might actually be worth going with.  But you are just a jock. No wait.  You're a jerk.
My dad's always here running the store, busy and stuff...and I fill in once a week so he can get a night off.
I'm sorry, I totally spaced.  I just...I didn't realize it...
No, that's not what I mean.  I mean -- look.  You know what made me leave that game?  Coach was giving this speech, about not slacking off when you see the opportunity to score.
I can't think of anything to say that's not cheesy.
He likes it.
...I've never tried it.
Jessica, can you drive me home?
You got it, stud.
I -- I don't know, you can't ask me that.
I don't want to dupe her, Jessica.  If I say it, I have to be sure I mean it.
That's what we are, we keep each other on track.  Prior to this day, we've postured.  We've procrastinated. We've pretended.  We've -- well I can't think of other p-words, but we've probably done them too.
Separately, we are flawed and vulnerable.  But together, we are the masters of our sexual destiny!
Right.  That gives us...
Hey, where's Finch?
Hey, minuteman.
Yeah?  Well come prom night, those excuses aren't going to do you much good.
Alright, how do you guys stand?  Well, Finch, I know where you are, but you can't use that as an excuse.  Jim?
No, no that's fine.  So you doing okay?
Thank you, dad, I got it.
I thought so.  Because, one time?  I was at this --
...excuse me?!
Are you gonna do what I think you're gonna do?
Illegal channels?  Shit, if there's any channel that should be illegal, it's whatever that women's channel is. Lifetime Supply of Pantyhose, or some shit.
Feels like warm apple pie, dude.
Hey, you did better than I did, Nova.
Hey guys, you came to watch me in action?
You've got something going?
Strip?
I am sorry, Jim.  I suppose we will not be doing any studying now.
About the other day...I've been thinking.
Now?!
You comfortable?
You sure you're comfortable?
Kevin, next year...with you in Ann Arbor, and me in Nashville...it's not gonna work, is it.
Have you ever heard of the bible?
Feeling better, Oz?
I'm such a loser.
Yeah right.  I got an idea for something new.  How 'bout you guys actually locate your dicks, remove the shrink wrap, and fuckin' use 'em.
Keep it down, dude.
Actually, I'm waiting for someone.
Medusa... What's this? some kind of club?
It's nothing. A stupid party. Not really a night club, it's, uh...
Professor Claude Rousel. The one your uncle was working with. He teaches cultural history.
What good can you do? Why are you being so fucking stupid?
Wait a second, are you like the Steven King of France or something...
What about food? Even beautiful women have to eat. It's true. I read it. Please? A half an hour?  My treat?  Pleez! Don't make go out there alone again! I'm begging you!
So's Woody Allen.  No, your uncle really helped me. I was sort of messed up for a while. Wasting my time just partying and... just stupid shit. He kind of woke me up, gave me a job, got me taking classes.  You know, he and Claude, their work is controversial, but they're serious about it. Totally dedicated.
I saw him. Just before those bastards zapped him back. The ADM is in the wine cellar, in a bottle of Chateau Margaux.
What...?
What does it say?
My uncle's in a coma you moron!
The ADM. Let's go.
All my life I've worked to unlock the power of the unconscious mind. Well this is it. This is power!
Uncle Terrence?
Uncle Terrence, you're...
I don't know. There were others much closer. He was religious?
Aaaaa!!! Get the fuck away from me!
Shit. I feel sick.
Andy, stop! I think he can help you - 
Andy!
Serafine? Is that you? What's going on?
But Inspector, this girl, I wouldn't call her reliable.
Merde.
You never heard the story of Saint Severin driving the werewolves from Paris?
I have to go now, before it gets light.
Did I tell you that?
Yes, your highness.
Yes, your highness.
I don't know - I don't remember anything that happened before the revolution. . .
Why do you want to go to Paris?
Just what do you think you're doing?!
Every Russian family has one..
Sad?
I'm so scared...
Don't let me go!
"If" I accept?! Of course I'm going to accept! it's what I always wanted!
No, I really like my tongue... we're very attached.  Oyyyy... Okay, now... promise you won't get angry.
Get to the point sometime tonight.. I'm late for a wenching.
Hey, she's just a kid. And she's going to Paris outta sight, outta mind, outta Russia.
Boy, don't you hate it when that happens?
What was that?
What do we do now?
We did it! We did it, my boy! We're going to see Tatiana at the ballet tonight and we're going to be rich! Rich!
So. You don't want to go to the coronation, eh?
You're insane! You didn't kill the Romonovs - it was the...
Anastasia's music box... She had this all these years...  You could have found it...
I should go
And tell me that she's happy.
What?
No, because they're-they're laughing, so  I-I-I'd rather not. If you don't mind, I prefer-
Look, while we're talking we could be inside, you know that?
Well, I'm sorry, I-I can't... I-I- I've gotta see a picture exactly from the start to the finish, 'cause- 'cause I'm anal.
I'm-I'm-I'm gonna have a stroke.
Boy, those guys in the French Resistance were really brave, you know? Got to listen to Maurice Chevalier sing so much.
You? You kiddin'?  If the Gestapo would take away your Bloomingdale's charge card, you'd tell 'em everything.
I know, well, it's just that- you know, I mean, I-I-I-I gotta sing tomorrow night, so I have to rest my voice.
Yeah. I'm gonna get my... I'm gonna get my camera.
Down- I'm-I'm goin' uptown.
So sorry.
Well...
Well... thank you again.
No, I got time.
Sylvia Plath.
Oh, yeah.
Uh, I hate to tell yuh, this is nineteen seventy-five, you know that "neat" went out, I would say, at the turn of the century.  Who-who are-who are those photos on the wall?
'cause, uh, you never know what's gonna happen.
God bless.
Oh, all right.
I-I-I'm gonna buy you these books, I think, because I-I think you should read them. You know, instead of that cat book.
big subject with me, yeah.
Yeah, he's the Mafia. Linen Supply Business or Cement and Contract, you know what I mean?
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah, bu-bu-but why?
How is it any different?
It's-it's got bad plumbing and bugs. Jesus, I'll-My accountant will write it off as a tax deduction, I'll pay for it.
Well, what's the difference, anyway?
Let's just do it, all right?
Yeah, I know, they'll hate me immediately.  Thank you.
Yeah.
I didn't follow you!
Do you realize how paranoid you are?
Yeah-well, you wanted to keep the relationship flexible, remember? It's your phrase.
What's the difference? It's all mental masturbation.
I'm home!
And then I remembered when I was a kid how I accidentally saw my parents making love.
Yeah?
and I keep, you know, it's-
Well, well, sure... because he's a singer and you're a singer, you know, so it's perfect. So you're trying to suffocate yourself. It-it makes perfect sense. Uh, uh, that's a perfect analytic... kind of insight.
Yeah, but you said, "Will it change my wife"!
David! David! I can't believe this!
I'm following you and David, if you-
There's a big black spider in the bathroom.
Oooh.
I told you a thousand times you should always keep, uh, a lotta insect spray. You never know who's gonna crawl over.
It's wonderful. Then why don'tcha get William F. Buckley to kill the spider?
Yep. I didn't think it was that big, but it's a major spider. You got a broom or something with a-
Oh, I-I left it at your house.
Well, what are you doing... what are you doing with-
Oh, I had the radio on.
-me, my God, it's a great day!
Oh, look, look, there's that... that's that's my old house. That's where we used to live.
Happy birthday.
What is this? Is this a... Present?  Are you kidding?
And... I don't know... I mean, six months ago I-I woulda done it. I woulda done it, just to please him.
It's wonderful. I mean, you know they just watch movies all day.
Whose "Catcher in the Rye" is this?
Oh, Alvy, come on.
Hey, you didn't read "Death in Venice" till I bought it for yuh.
Oh, yeah?  Terrific.
Hey, you wouldn't believe this. Two minutes ago, the Knicks are ahead fourteen points, and now...  they're ahead two points.
Alvy, what is so fascinating about a group of pituitary cases trying to stuff the ball through a hoop?
Bad?
Really? It must be a tremendous hem.
Are you?
Oh, sex with you is really a kafkaesque experience.
without getting... well, let's put it this way...
Oh, do yuh?
Ah, Max, you, uh...
Max, the city is terribly worried.
Max, there's no crime, there's no mugging.
Do you realize how immoral this all is?
Great, but nobody laughs at it 'cause your jokes aren't funny.
I don't know, I mean, I-
You like this house, Max?
But she's colored.
Oh, God, you should've seen what I looked like then.
Lotta beautiful women. It was fun to flirt.
I'll have the usual trouble with Annie in bed tonight. Whatta I need this?
Hi, I'm-I'm Tony Lacey.
No, no, no, not at all.
Well, hey, that's, that's nice. Uh. Oh, listen, this is, uh, Alvy Singer. Do you know Alvy? Uh... and... uh... Tony Lacey.
Just... that's all you need. You can come and stay here.
You can have it to use. Why-why are you smiling?
Well, I used to live there. I used to live there for years. You know, but it's gotten-it's so dirty now.
It has your ring.
She's a constant surprise.
The movie.
Mac's a pretty great director, Joe.  He's a woman's director.  And nothing's happening.  Course he won't fire her, because of the friendship... But it was discussed.  He had to battle his studio to get her in the first place.
Leo?  It was out to Jude Law.  Jude passed.
She already has.
So they tell me.  Not soon enough, of course.  How are you, Sal?  You look fantastic. It changes your life, you know.  A baby. It puts everything in perspective, doesn't it.  Doesn't it, Mac?  You can't be the center of your own world, anymore.
I don't know how to make her funny.
To dander.  Otis.
Oh.
They can tell from the eyelashes, you know?  He's got eyelashes yay long.  They must be a foot long.  The older you are when you have a baby, the more likely this stuff is to crop up.
Borrow whatever you like.
Let's get the kids.
Directing suits you.
Lucy overdosed.
Cal, my wife Judy.
Are you my big hard hero?
Oh yeah?
Hm.  We should do it again.
We couldn't be on more solid ground.
He gets huge advances on his novels. He's going back to that.  You know how he hates it here.
Okay.  I'm sorry, look, I meant to tell you.  It was the only chance I had to meet her.
You invited her to our anniversary party? I didn't even invite my mother.
I can't imagine anyone else playing Genna.
Of course we do.  We have to sign our taxes.
Dolphins.  Great.
Can't have gone far?  He's like a greyhound.  He could be miles away.
Otis!!!!
What else don't I know about, Joe?  Let's get really clear here.
That hasn't the first fucking thing to do with love.  It's whether we can live together... like this!  All the time.
Don't push me away.
Don't do this!
I'll be with you.
He's my favorite.
Panes!  How are you?
Has she called?
What's a sign for that?
The novel.  No, Skye Davidson is playing the lead.
You manage to throw me off balance.  I adore you.
And I you.
Ours.
And you got Skye Davidson.  Pretty big leagues for a first timer.  Do you even like movies?
Your Eames table is incredible.  And the B&B.  I just put that in a client's home, actually, but in red.
Sally did all this herself?
No you're not.
Scout's honor.
I think he's really angry with me too.
Oh, I love that.  I'm just great.  I'm so happy to be here. And I apologize for invading you.  And I'm so happy you asked me to.  I'm so touched.  I know how private you and Sally are.
They're nothing like us.
Are you making an ass of yourself?
Ryan, you've got to come!  You've got to help me find the dog!  I let their dog out.  We need to find the dog.
Ryan!
I'm sorry.
Not at all.
Oh good, I'm worse... Are you really twenty-two?
Oh, Jesus, Panes.  I can't, I can't believe that bitch is in my house.
You're a shit.
That's it?  Yes.  Fine?
No.  Not something new.
Thank you, Panes.
You don't need to thank me.
Oh.  Well, yes.  It's extraordinary.  You think you could sign it for us?
I hope they're watercolors!
Yes.
It's much more personal in here.
But she really gets to the heart of Joe, doesn't she?  She's a genius.
I trust you.
Well good.  Thank God.
Cal knows who he is.  Did you notice how happy Joe was when the drugs came out tonight?
Neither does Joe.
We're fine.  We're great.  We're having a baby and we're moving to London.
His image of you is a possessive, fragile neurotic.
Tell me about it.
I don't know what came over me, talking back like that.  I must be going crazy...
No -- I mean yes -- I mean -- if you don't have other plans.
Are you sure this is a real dance?
Oh, that's okay, I'll let him off this time.  Are you crazy?  This guy's built like a pebble!  You know they do great prosthetic antennas nowadays --
I'm Princess Bala.
I CAN'T DANCE WITH A WORKER!
I order you to find out where we are!
Theoretically, yes.  But is the monarchical hierarchy applicable without the underlying social structure to support it?
Oh come on, <u>you're</u> the one who came after me -- the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker!
Now, worker, you shall take me back to the colony, and have your head cut off and stuck on a sharp pole!
This lake is huge!  And so close to the colony!  Think of the vacation potential!
Hlllllllp!
Face it, Z, we're lost!  We must have walked halfway across the world by now!  How did I get into this mess...
We've found it!  <u>Insectopia</u>!  Look at all this food'
Just looking for fun, adventure, trouble, I guess.
Why do they have you tied up here?
Bala has always been a hopeless romantic, General.
You did?
Who is that idiot?
Don't be scared, kid.  Barbatus's got yer back.
Princess Bala, sir.  Your fiancee.
Dammit, this tunnel is priority A-1! We can't afford <u>any delays</u> on this project!
Yeah...I mean...well...I don't know, really, sir.
Oh, no, sir!
Damn, I'm proud of you, boy.  I wish I had a hundred ants of your caliber. The world would tremble.  Now, time for some R and R.  You're invited to the royal victory party!
Affirmative.
Wow, what a spread -- you know, there's a food shortage in the rest of the colony.
ARREST HIM!
Yes, what else?
Very well, General -- I know you -- all work and no play!
...I should?
I don't know what you're talking about, Z.
It's a sign that you're crazy!  Do you know what the penalty for impersonating a soldier is?
Yeah, I know.
You must eat -- and you must get healthy -- and you must forget him. Such a fine boy he seemed when he first moved in here -- clean and cut -- a regular Ivy Leaguer. Turns out he is King Farouk. Mit the drinking -- mit the cha cha -- mit the no napkins. A girl like you, for the rest of your life you want to cry in your noodle soup? Who needs it! You listen to me, you find yourself a nice, substantial man -- a widower maybe -- and settle down -- instead of nashing all those sleeping pills -- for what, for whom? -- for some Good Time Charlie?  Sssh!
You're beginning to sound like Mr. Kirkeby already.
The characters you meet. Something happens to men in elevators. Must be the change of altitude -- the blood rushes to their head, or something -- boy, I could tell you stories --
Yeah.
Oh.  You mean -- like a girl-friend?
I wasn't trying to be personal -- it's just that the fellows in the office were -- whether you wondering about you ever --
What time does the show go on?
All right? That's wonderful! It's the Majestic -- 44th Street.
What gave you that idea?
In the last six weeks you've only been in my elevator once -- and then you didn't take your hat off.
No -- I like it.
Of course not.
This is a bad day for me.
I understand. Christmas -- family and all that --
Don't you remember? We were at the office party together --
Two o'clock.
Wait a minute -- let's talk this over first.  Just what are you going to tell her?
His apartment?
Something wrong with your legs?
Yeah -- I know what you mean.  Queen.
Mr. Sheldrake? Oh, yes. Very.
For me?
Some people take, some people get took -- and they know they're getting took -- and there's nothing they can do about it.
Well, maybe not exactly -- I tried to do it with a gun.
Worse than that -- she was the wife of my best friend -- and I was mad for her. But I knew it was hopeless -- so I decided to end it all. I went to a pawnshop and bought a forty-five automatic and drove up to Eden Park -- do you know Cincinnati?
Uh-huh. While I was sitting there, trying to make my mind up, a cop stuck his head in the car, because I was illegally parked -- so I started to hide the gun under the seat and it went off -- pow!
I see you bought some napkins.
I know.  I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake --?
I don't know.
Sir?
No, sir. I'm not going to deny it. But if you'd just let me explain --
I made other plans. You can have both tickets.
It also says here -- that you are alert, astute, and quite imaginative --
Here you are, Baxter. Have a nice time.
I know how it is.
No, sir. That's very unfair -- especially to your wife.
Well, if you must know -- I fired my secretary, my secretary got to my wife, and my wife fired me. Ain't that a kick in the head?
Don't mind what?
You're not going to bring anybody up to my apartment.
Especially not Miss Kubelik.
Now you're being bright?
Just following doctor's orders. I've decided to become a mensch. You know what that means? A human being.
What's the matter with Miss Kubelik?
That Kubelik -- boy!  Would I like to get her on a slow elevator to China.
Hello? Yeah, Baxter. What's up?
Instead of Friday -- could you possibly switch to Thursday? You'd be doing me a great favor --
Look, you can't stay here. Just take your champagne and go.
Thank you, Mr. Vanderhof. But I'm sick -- I have this terrible cold -- and a fever -- and I got to go to bed right after work.
Buddy-boy, that's the worst thing you can do. If you got a cold, you should go to a Turkish bath -- spend the night there -- sweat it out --
Oh, no. I'd get pneumonia -- and if I got pneumonia, I'd be in bed for a month -- and if I were in bed for a month --
Something like that.
What's her name?
Any of that coffee left?
Say, Baxter -- we're having a little party and we ran out of ice -- so I was wondering --
Where are you moving to?
Can you use a bottle of champagne?
No, thanks -- I don't feel like it. Look, Doc -- in case I don't see you again -- how much do I owe you for taking care of that girl?
You know, that big-shot down in Cuba with the crazy beard.
No.
Still stuck on her, huh.
Ask anybody around here. As a matter of fact, when it's time for me to go -- and I may go just like that --  -- I have promised my body to the Columbia Medical Center.
Good night.
The party's over.
What's the matter? Did I do something wrong?
It's on the way.  I see you went ahead and cut your hair.
Why do you keep calling me, Jeff? What do you want from me?
If you'll just listen to me for a minute --
Handle what?
Come on, Fran -- don't be like that. You just going to sit there and keep bawling?  You won't talk to me, you won't tell me what's wrong --  Look, I know you think I'm stalling you. But when you've been married to a woman for twelve years, you don't just sit down at the breakfast table and say "Pass the sugar -- and I want a divorce." It's not that easy.  Anyway, this is the wrong time. The kids are home from school -- my in- laws are visiting for the holidays -- I can't bring it up now.  This isn't like you, Fran -- you were always such a good sport -- such fun to be with --
Funny thing happened to me at the office party today -- I ran into your secretary -- Miss Olsen. You know -- ring-a-ding-ding? I laughed so much I like to died.
Sure. Monday and Thursday -- and Monday again -- and Thursday again --
Baxter?
I don't know. I guess that's the way it crumbles -- cookie-wise.
What are you talking about?
First you can't wait to get me up here, and now -- rush, rush, rush! Makes a person feel cheap.
You bet it won't. I'll arrange for you to get a month's severance pay --  That's right, Miss Olsen. I'm letting you go.
You let me go four years ago, Jeff. Only you were cruel enough to make me sit out there and watch the new models pass by.
Maybe we should send up two flies -- and see if they'll propagate in orbit.
Propagate -- you know, multiply -- baby flies?
What's there to talk about -- this whole thing disgusts me.
No -- absolutely not --
Part.
I'm sure it is, but I had hepatitis.
Yeah. Way north.
That's quite an array of ribbons...
How long were you up there ?
Headquarters 11 Corps -- 405th A.S.A Battalion -- S-2 -- Com-Sec -- Intelligence -- Nha Trang.
Arch light.
Call me what, sir?
A sauciere --
That's right, sir -- I come from New Orleans -- I was raised to be a sauciere.. a great sauciere. We specialize in sauces; my whole family. It's what we do. I was supposed to go to Paris and study at the Escoffier School; I was saving the money. They called me for my physical so I figured the Navy had better food.
I've arranged with those people we saw at Hau Fat to give us some 50 caliber in trade for a couple a drums of fuel --
Whatdoya think it thinks.
Flood.
Why -- Charlie put it there to kill --
Listen.
They nail him for it bad ?
Touchy.
What -- happened here.
No, sir.
You know much about about Special Forces; Green Berets, Captain ?
Attacks repulsed, as I was saying.  This is only  for this war, Captain. Viet Cong -- 54; North Vietnamese regular forces -- 15; South Vietnamese -- 28 -- regular forces and otherwise.  Americain -- 6. Of course, they were, perhaps, mistakes, Captain.
You smell that.  You smell that?
The wind --
Why the hell didn't you tell me about that place -- a good left.  There aren't any good left slides in this whole, shitty country. It's all goddamn beach break.
It's still pretty hairy, sir.
Why the hell you wanna go up to Nu Mung Ba for?
He musta changed !  I got to get into the Nung River, here or here.
So? I heard you had a good bunch of killers here.
We were attacked -- down river. We need supplies and medical help.
Gimme water.
Go away -- hide yourself.
Going back  - to the jungle to die.
I had immense plans.
My river... my people... my jungle... my ideas... my country... my wife...  ... my death.
Did you know him very well?
Love him... Yes, it is true. That's the hard part for me... I knew him better than anyone ... I knew him best.
Were you with him, when...
Yeah... thanks.
You hear it again?
What is this bridge?
Oh, you don't talk to Colonel Kurtz.  You listen to him. God, these are good. I kept these people off you, you know. It wasn't easy.
This -- Bob Hope or the like --
134  CONTINUED:
48   CONTINUED:
165  CONTINUED:  
I have not, but I very much want to.  What do you know about the trouble in Devil's Cauldron?
Prolonged darkness makes people crazy.
Maybe you should drive him into Devil's Cauldron, let them decide what to do with him.
Okay by me.  You're the one likes these hot springs so much.
Been driving long?
I took the odds on getting down in one piece, and I made it.  Now we're in my territory.
We've got another two hours of daylight.
Told you I'm fine!
Killing wildlife not good enough anymore, so you go on to bigger and better things.
Talk to that good-looking girl of yours?
Sam, listen -- I shot to defend my man.  Other guy drew first.
You don't mind me saying, Mr. Desmond, you look like hell.
Have you heard anything from the girl staying with me, Anne Marie?
Jiminy Christmas.  What do you want from me?
What are you talking about?
You can't see past your lousy little assignment, sniffing around the pipeline.  The few voters there are in this district look up to Corbett, and I'm not about to alienate them.
...You give us a ride in the Cessna you got hangared at the pumping station, we'll be in Fairbanks in a few hours.
Go easy.
Kenai's PA -- but how the fuck she seein' us?
Spencer is okay. You'd better start finding something else to do with your free time. If you can't feel good about this break and step out a little...  You ought to get Mr. Udall to send you over a psychiatrist.
I don't know... It's very strange not feeling that stupid panic thing inside you all the time. Without that you just start thinking about yourself -- and what does that ever get anybody. Today, on the bus there was this adorable couple and I felt myself giving them a dirty look -- I had no idea everything was...
Spencer's doing fine. So what are you saying, that you're frustr...
Do you love me?
Have they done blood tests on him?
Yes.
Water...  Nobody told you it might be a good idea to remove the carpeting and drapes in Spencer's room?
Doc!!!  So listen, you gotta let me know about the additional costs -- one way or the other we'll...
I know. He's just the best.
Oh, please...
I'm not kidding.
I want you to go on this trip.
Hello?
There's... there's no need to bring anything dressy... or... I mean -- I didn't know if we'd be eating at any restaurant that have dress codes.
Whether crabs are in season there now...
I was going to do that for you.
Hey -- you let him...
You don't owe me that.
That's why you brought me? Look at me! Is that really why you brought me... Like I'm a what and I owe you what?!
Go ahead.
No! It's certainly not. No -- I don't think so. No.
Well...
I don't think so. You need help with the pants?
Hey, where are you going? You can't do this.  I can't take a dog.  Nobody's ever been in here before.
It's not only financial assistance. What he's got to do is go to Baltimore tomorrow and ask his parents for money. It's not going to happen on the phone.
Mr. Udall, I'd like to talk to you please.
I found Verdell, Mr. Udall.
I called. I never touched you. I didn't leave my name or nothing.
Go away.
That cleaning woman doesn't...
I carry bacon in my pocket.
I, uh... I was... attacked. Walked in on people robbing me. I was hospitalized. I almost died.
Well, I always painted. Always. And my mother always encouraged it. She was sort of fabulous about it actually... and she used to... I was too young to think there was anything at all wrong with it... and she was very natural. She used to pose nude for me... and I thought or assumed my father was aware of it.
Melvin...
I told you to go on in.
You know who you want. I'll take your seat any day. So do something... don't sleep on it... go over there. I don't think anybody should ever sleep on anything -- it's not always good to let things calm down.
Oh God, this is like a nightmare.
Why are you doing this?
What?
What are you doing?
Oh!  I got a question.  Jesus, this has been driving me crazy for years -- shit, listen to me.  I sound like some fucking fanboy.  I'm sorry, but I just got to ask you.  Everybody talks about how you left the Agency and got into the business and then how you went after the Russian, Nicholai Talinkov --
Where have you been, Robert?
How did he know?
I don't know what the fuck you are.
Deadline?
I know what happened.
I give a fuck?  I'm done!  I quit! Do you fucking hear me!  I'm fucking gone!
What?  How did you know I had a cat?
Took a guess.  Lucky for you, I guessed right.
Yeah.
You want me to pump?
No.  They hired Bain.  The contract would have been mine, but Bain took it from me as he took the previous one.
He wants to kill you?
And you want to use me to get him?
Don't tell me I don't have a choice!
It's simple.  You need me.  I need you.  And we will both need money.
Why?
How?
It looks like white's game.
We played with a code using <u>The New</u> <u>York Times</u> obituaries.  Over three years we played twelve matches.  I never won.
How did you get into the business?
Ahhhh...
They are very good at what they do. It's very seductive.  The training, the weapons, the travel --
That's fiction.
I've never been to the Gulf of Mexico.  Is it as nice as they say?
I've always wanted to learn something like that.
They saw you coming a mile away.  If I had known we'd be using --
Then, we wait.
Yes.
I don't know.  It just happened.  I was here ten years ago, I'm here now.  That's it.
Yes.
I waited until I was insane and then I walked into the bank.  He was sitting there, very calm, waiting for me.
No.
I think I got one today.
What?
I know.  It makes me crazy.
I'm sure you will.
Are you attracted to me?
Wait until he is on the stairs.
I prefer it like this.
Then, I'll sail alone.
It's possible.
I hope not.
Don't know.  That's how it works.
Everyone handles it differently. Some are ready, some are not.
What are you having?
What is it with that Josh guy? Who does he think he is shoving that Reflections rag down our throats?
Anything in it?
This place is getting expensive too, used to be twelve.
No, it's the whole idea behind it. How did they get this place?
Right and not just the bar, Lubosh and his mates took the whole freakin' building.
Care to elaborate?
Amazing, he didn't even say "if".
I feel like a mole in this joint, so I guess I might as well come out lookin' like one!
And if the police stop by - what do I tell them?
Yeah, that was Honza's idea, I had to buy him a few beers in return for the gear.
I'm an idiot?
Really, "The Freeman Centre"?
I've been saying that since we met.
Don't we have enough already?
And suppose a little old lady lives there?
I don't know Doug, we haven't even got the place together and already you want to extend it.
Look I gotta get going, shouldn't you have met Katka?
So why didn't we?
Why don't we go together?
No, We aren't going to do it.
She's cool.
Take the drill back to Honza at the office, I promised to get it back for the weekend and I don't want to show my face there.
You might make Henry happy......Sure, I'll do it.
It's me you want, I'm responsible for all this.
You know, there is one thing I can't figure out. All along they've been bugging me about those files and when I told them I'd burned all that stuff, they went nuts - they told the Consul guy they were medical records?
Yeah, somewhere?
And if you're wrong.
What are you talking about?
You mean, Josh's father had nothing to do with it?
You're sure?
That one?
Good morning.
Sure. Excellent.
So what's it going to be, Coogan's or U Vayvudoo?
I'm not staying out late and I can't come back to your place.
What?
No, it's not true, you're lying.
Ah, so what?
How?
No act of love but willing violence demanded by one and begged by the other. As life turned to fantasy and reality to ecstasy a need, so deep no light could reach, surfaced like a nocturnal creature unearthed for momentary and glorious display. Left alone in a rose-tinted afterglow dimming fast she tasted the moisture of her body and wondered why light came to day and such desires to her pale-skin body.
Why are you doing all this, what for?
I figured you more as a Socialist?
What is it you want?
Okay, Okay, but I want it right back. It belongs to my father.
Just yesterday.
I decided to help out at the Asylum.
I don't want to go.
This press we cannot control. Americans, I think.
You are quite sure it's secure?
So, who is in the building?
It was crazy not to have destroyed them
Yeah.
But if it doesn't happen, grab for something within reach. Life's tough enough without causing yourself disappointment --
I have no idea what to say. How to act. What if I do the wrong thing?
Everything's being done but it's not enough. I have to find something -- more.
-- This your idea of small talk?
'Is it really me?'
I'll take a chance.
It's private.
Like you'd know.
I know. Don't say anything.
Yeah. Maybe. I dunno.
I know there's a plan for everyone, but sometimes I don't understand what the message is -- or what the point is.
Interpreted by another guy like my father.
You're not in a very good mood.
You don't either. Take a look at yourself. Maybe you're scared that someone might actually like you --
Why are you doing all this? To impress me?
I can't believe you asked my father's permission.
The cells in our bodies are always changing. In six or seven years all your cells have changed. You could be like a completely new person from the inside out.
I don't understand...
Come on.
A Thermos of hot coffee. A blanket. Socks.
Pull over.
I should have told you sooner --
Did you give him a gift?
Dad --
You're in the play?
Reverend Sullivan. Can I ask you something?
Landon. We've lived with this for over a year now and --
You know about this stuff?
I'm sorry she never got her miracle.
Finding the real world to your liking, Mr. Carter?
It's mine to give. I didn't steal it.
You came here to give me my report card?
Am I at the same angle to you and the basket as before?
Yes, sir!
Marty. What's for breakfast?
Learn anything?
Hi, Marty.
You remember me...?
Hi, Marty!
Fine..
The sunrise? What for?
Well... yeah...
I don't want to hit you in the stomach!
You mean, you're gonna --
You'd like to see a nuclear holocaust?
Unfortunately, the way things are going, you may get your wish. You may see the entire annhiliation of the world. If not, you'll certainly see the destruction of all out natural resources. We can already see the air we breathe, not to mention the pollution in our rivers and lakes. We'll  see all of our oil reserves depleted, in fact, all of our energy sources. Yes, you people have a lot to look forward to -- a lot to see.
Who, me?
You're the only Mr. Lewis in this class.  If you have something to say, say it so the whole class can hear.
Well, yeah, I was thinking, if cars are gonna be going two or three hundred miles an hour, they're gonna be using an awful lot of gas. Like, what if we run out?
Oh -- right! Uh, Madison 3489.
AM or PM?
Pro, the sun's out!
Shemp is right here in this room...two minutes from now, and at exactly 9:02PM, we'll catch up to him.
Must have been? Used to live? I do live here.
Professor. Well, not exactly, Professor. You see, we don't point it at the sun.
I don't recall ever seeing it before.
Look. I'm a little worried about this -- this whole thing with my mother, he admitted to the Professor. I mean, I don't know if I can do it -- I mean, hitting on my own mother, that's pretty heavy.
That's exactly what I said! I mean, a guy and his mother -- that's illegal, isn't it?
Marty,  I know I've repeatedly asked you not to tell me anything about the future, but....well, those loud bangs on the tape recorder....are they....
You see, I never rebuilt the time machine after it was destroyed in 1952. I decided that experimenting with time and possibly changing history was too risky. Anyway, experiments in time travel were banned in all 87 states after the governor of Cuba caught Dr. Felstien fooling around in the Bermuda Triangle -- that was back in '64.
But if you didn't rebuild the time machine, how did I go back in time in the first place?
Hell no! The way my mom carries on about sex -- you even mention the word and she goes into cardiac arrest. You shoulda seen her face when I told her we were gonna stay up all night Saturday, he added. Always afraid something is going to happen.
He said not to tell.
Oh yeah?
Okay.
Yeah.
Kit... Maybe I'd better get a shovel.
Say, what kind of rifle was that you were shooting at me?
They're okay.
Hey, listen, Tom, I don't mean to tell you how to run your show here but these cuffs are pinching. What do you say now?
You know, before I met her, nobody could ask me how I was doing with my girl. Matter of fact, I didn't really have one.
Yeah. I can imagine.
What?
And the flowers... Let's not pick them. They're so nice.
I can look and see.
Are you sure?
Why?
Think I got 'em?
Yeah, you look tired... Listen, honey. when all this is over, I'm going to sit down and buy you a big, thick steak.
No.
"Rumor: Pat Boone is seriously considering giving up his career so he can return to school full-time and complete his education. Fact: Pat has told intimates that so long as things are going well for his career, it's the education that will have to take the back seat."
Maybe we should've tried to hop it.
Never mind. It doesn't matter... If I'm worth a damn, I'll pick the right direction. And if I'm not, well, I don't care. See what I mean?
Hi... ah, Mister Scarborough here?
Just thinking.
Yes.
You didn't walk out here.
You mean the guy from the old wine commercials?
Buckaroo!  What the Sam Hill!
Careful...don't make noise and don't touch me.  I'm hotter than flapjacks.
It's your hand, Buckaroo.
Dr. Lizardo's a raving lunatic, Perfect Tommy, a vicious psychopath with crazy eyes and flaming orange hair that once upon a time was mousy brown like yours.
Have you warned Professor Hikita?
That's me. I've been ionized, but I'm okay. I'm, switching on the homing beacon, mark two minute intervals.
You're a welcome sight...
Apache?
Let her out. In my custody.
Dead.  Damnit!
And there's a two-hundred-dollar deductible we have to eat on that crack in her windshield.
What're you doing here? Why're you looking at me like that?
Was she pretty?
You don't wanna know.
Go where?  Where're you going?
Please, Penny.  You just gotta trust me now.  Okay?  And don't panic. Because it's gonna be all right.
What?  If we just believe in Buckaroo Banzai?
John Whorfin will kill us!
What'd you do before?  Can I ask?
What?! He's a son of a bitch!
He'll wander back when he's sober and apologize. He always does.
Audrey, listen, I need help. I know it's late and I shouldn't be calling you like this â€ believe me I wouldn't have if I could see any other alternative, but I â€ I'm sorry - listen, how are you â€ I'm sorry. You doing okay?
Barton, honestly, only the last couple-
Could you come back later?  It's just...  too hot... My head is killing me.
It's still a little early for me.
...No, I've always found that writing comes from a great inner pain. Maybe it's a pain that comes from a realization that one must do something for one's fellow man â€ to help somehow to ease his suffering.  Maybe it's a personal pain. At any rate, I don't believe good work is possible without it.
Look, maybe it's none of my business, but a man with your talent â€ don't you think your first obligation would be to your gift? Shouldn't you be doing whatever you have to do to work again?
Goddamn voices... DROWN 'EM!
...Huh? No, I'm â€
Okay. I'm just having trouble getting started. It's funny, I'm blocked up. I feel like I need some kind of indication of... what's expected â€
On the Beery picture! Where are we? Wuddya got?
What do you do far a living?
Neighbor, I'd feel better about the damned inconvenience if you'd let me buy you a drink.
What kind of work do you do, Barton, if you don't mind my asking?
You don't say. That's a tough racket. My hat's off to anyone who can make a go of it. Damned interesting work, I'd imagine.
Doesn't surprise me at all.
Hell yes. Because I believe in it. Fire, theft, and casualty are not things that only happen to other people â€ that's what I tell 'em. Writing doesn't work out, you might want to look into it. Providing for basic human need â€ a fella could do worse.
What kind of scribbler are you â€ newspaperman did you say?
No, I'm actually writing for the pictures now â€
That's okay; actually I am just starting out in the movies â€ though I was pretty well established in New York, some renown there,
Hell, I could tell you some storiesâ€
Sure, sure Charlie, you can help by just being yourself.
Howdy, neighbor.
...Got a sweetheart?
Nope, never watched any. I'm not that interested in the act itself â€
...Listen to me belly-achin'. As if my problems amounted to a hill of beans. How goes the life of the mind?
Yeah, but â€
Get a grip on yourself, brother. Whatever the problem is, we'll sort it out.
Never heard of it. Let's move him to the Grand, or the Wilshire, or hell, he can stay at my place.
Yeah... rye whiskey?
...Can I be honest, Mr. Lipnik?
I â€ Mr. Lipnik â€
Mr. Lipnik, I â€
Actually it hasn't officially gone through yet. Had wardrobe whip this up. You gotta pull teeth to get anything done in this town. I can understand a little red tape in peacetime, but now it's all-out warfare against the Japs. Little yellow bastards.  They'd love to see me sit this one out.
Welcome to the Hotel Earle. May I help you, sir?
Got a couple questions to ask ya.
Couple of days ago we see the same M.O. out in Los Feliz.
Well, some of his throat was there.
Second one of your friends to end up dead.
He teach you to do it?
We got a treatment on it yet?
Mr. Lipnik, I â€
Home. Watching TV.
There's no smoking in this building.
How are you, Nick?
I need a cigarette.
You did it for me.
I did dye my hair.  It didn't have anything to do with her.  I was a redhead for a while, too.
Don't!  I know about your husband.  You still like girls, Beth?
I thought you were out of cigarettes.
But you said you liked men to use their hands.
You like playing games, don't you?
Would you like a drink?  I was just going to have one.
It was an accident.  They got in the line of fire.
There's a name from the past.
Noah was my counselor in my freshman year.  That's probably where I got the idea for the icepick.  For my book. Funny how the subconscious works.  Hazel is my friend.
Why not?
You can make a mistake.
My wife used to call me that.
What's it about?
When did you write it?
I'm leaving the house around midnight.  In case you're going to follow me.  I'm going down to Johnny's club.
Do you think I told her to kill You?
I paid him $50,000 in cash for your psychiatric file.
About three months before I met you.
You're not going to tell me what she's doing.  I thought we weren't playing games anymore.
Did you miss me?
What are you researching?
I'm writing a book.
I finished my book.
What do you want, Nick?  Flowers? I'll send you some flowers.
I hate rugrats.
It teaches you to lie.
In the beginning.  Then I got to like what he did for me.
Nope.  There was some talk; it never panned.
What kind of talk?
Before your time, pop.  Mid-sixties.  Five or six hits. He's got a club down in the Fillmore now.
What you doin', son?
You think I --
You oughta use a rubber, pop.  You really should.
You feeling better?
I don't believe it.
Not unless she got up in the ring and turned into one mean sonofabitch.
You look like dogshit.
He left the club with his girlfriend about midnight.  That's the last time anybody saw him.
First you've got her buying your file.  Now you've got her killing Nilsen.  Forget her, willya?  Go someplace.  Sit in the sun.  Get away from this goddamn fog.  Get her out of your system.
You're driving around North Beach for no particular reason and this car won't get out of the way --
On what basis?
No Lisa Anderson, detective.
I'm a painter, too.
Piss painting?
Gee. You shouldn't take it so seriously, Jean. That's why you can't stop taking drugs. You always think people don't like you. Everyone likes you.
After the show we should take a nice long vacation. Maybe go to Hawaii. That's what I'm gonna do. I'm going to give up painting and start playing music again. I wanna sing.
Chill, man! Be cool! This isn't even my apartment!
Naaaa. Poor thing has a little dick.
I didn't see you.
I hear your show was sold out already. There's a very important collector who's interested in some of your works.
Bruno spoke to me already. We could talk about it.
I'm here.
Well, you said that.  You've got a lot of references from Leonardo da Vinci, don't you?
We don't hang them at home, y'know â€ just in the streets..
Yeah, just put their bill on my tab.
Who am I?
I am... On Gina.  Fuck â€ I didn't think we were actually gonna do this.
... What's the matter?
It looks done.
... babies.
Don't you think he's using you?
So. Are you ready? I start Columbia next fall. Of course, there's like, a year of pre-med stuff, but â€ whatever. I'm really excited.  And: Rene gave me a job as his secretary. His poems are getting published.
What's that about?
That is amazing. What year is it?
You don't have to be sorry. There's no one to blame. Jean, you're a real artist. I thought I was one. You made me realize I wasn't.
Hi.
No, I'd like the scarf.
I don't eat junk food.
Can you put me in the ring with him?
Tony Bennett... What do you mean?
Singing on stage and painting in your spare time.
I didn't know Tony Bennett painted.
So shut up and keep painting..
Jean, could you get me a Phillips screwdriver?
YO! Jean, this is Ramellzee.
Selina ... more facets than Vicki, huh?  Funny, but sort of mysterious...
You're the second man who killed me this week.  But hey, no prob ... I've got seven lives left.
Well, I could ... free up some time...
Selina.  Hi.  Didn't mean to --
You're not coming to that, are you?  "The Relighting of the Tree" thing?
... Maybe I'll watch it on TV.
Somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome, I'd suppose.
Had one.  Didn't work.
Now don't give me a killing-Max- won't-solve-anything speech, because it will.  Aren't you tired of this sanctimonious robber baron always coming out on top?  When he should be six feet under?
Down, Oswald.  We have to talk.  You see we've got something in common.
Thanks.  Jeez.  Not used to this man-woman, cat-mouse business. Generally the babes flock to me, I tell 'em take a number.
The Christmas Eve of Destruction -- !
... eight, seven...
Actually this is all just a bad dream.  You're home in bed. Heavily sedated, resting comfortably, and dying from the carcinogens you've personally spewed in a lifetime of profiteering. Tragic irony or poetic justice? You tell me.
My god ... it's true.  The Penguin- Man of the sewers ... Please, don't h--
No, just give you a splitting headache.
We need signatures.  To overturn the ballot.  I can supply those, Oswald.
I got my own ... <u>quest</u> to pursue up here.  It's crucial I not get sidetracked, with some silly ...
Max!  Relax!  Josh and Jen'll put a spin on this.  We'll talk it over tonight, at your costume par--
It's our secret.  Honest.  How can you be so mean to someone so meaningless?
I have been trying to reach Wilfred with no success.  As one grows older, one yearns for family.
It's good to see you again, Uncle. I've missed you.
Please be looking for me.
I started racing after my parents died.  There was something about the speed, the danger, that took me out of myself, that made the hurt go away.  You wouldn't understand.
After you have frozen, your icy tomb will plummet back to Gotham.
Mr. Bane, I'll finish off the city. You, as they say in showbiz, are on.  Take the boys and kill the kids. But bring me the Bat.
I thought you were going to stay in the museum and round up the thugs.
How did you...?
We gotta get those locks changed.
If we could relay the sunlight-
What can I do for you, Doctor?  A research grant?  A hospital wing?
Actually, I already work for you. Or did.  Your arboreal preservation project in South America.
Let me get this straight. A brilliant citizen, disfigured by a horrible accident, re-emerges as a psychotic super-villain bent on theft, revenge and destruction. You see a pattern here?
I'm late for the dedication.  Then I go after Freeze and Ivy.  Alone.
Where is my wife?
Give it up.  If you threw yourself-
Of trust. Tell me your plan.
Tell me and I'll kiss you.
What do we have here?  A lovely new supply of Venom.  I'll just take this to my laboratory for further study.
Our work?
Dr. Isley?  Pamela?  You look great. Especially for a dead woman.
I think they're getting worse.
Do you remember the night I fell into that cave and the bat chased me?
What did you say?
I'm afraid Master Dick has... gone traveling.
Could I let Batman go? For Dick. For me. Could I leave the shadows? Have a life. Friends. Family...
How are you feeling, young man?
Not that young. It's been a long time since you've called me that.
I'm Batman? I remember my life as Bruce Wayne.  But all this. It's like the life of a stranger.
There's one other thing. I feel..
Bruce. Son. Listen to me. You are a kind man. A strong man. But in truth you are not the most sane man.
I remember a bat. A monster. A demon. Chasing me.  Oh my God, Alfred.
_Two_ million dollars waiting to be transferred from the _Second_ Bank of Gotham on the _22nd_ How could Harvey? _Two_-Face resist?
He's home. I sent the signal.
What's wrong?
A girl cannot live by psychoses alone.
We all wear masks.
What? Ah yes. Of course. I'm sorry. It's just that...you're my idol.  And some people have been trying to keep us apart.
Wait. You can't go.
No grape could be more intoxicating than you, my dear. But we make due. To your charms.  Skol.
Slanta.
What do you know about obsession?
Why do I feel like the other man, here?
Why do you do that?
I don't want to remember!
The last entry read, Bruce insists on seeing a movie tonight.  Bruce insists. I made them go out. I made them take me to the movie. To that theater...  It was my fault. I killed them.
I always thought it was the bat that scared me that night that changed my life. But it wasn't. The real fear was hiding underneath: what I read in the journal, that my parents' deaths were my fault. That's what I couldn't remember. That's the crime I've been paying for all these years.
Excuse me.
Listen, Dick. Killing Two-Face won't take the pain away. It'll make it worse.
Exactly. And once you'd killed him you'd be lost. Like me.  All this has to be a choice. Otherwise...it's a curse.
Edward...
Who is it?
Why be brutalized by an uncaring world? My RES Box will give Joe Q Public a realm where he is king.  Not that someone like you would need it. Someone so intelligent. Witty. Charming. But for the lonely, the...
Uh, yeah. Thanks, Mr..uh...Face.
I'd say about thirty feet, sir.
GET IN THE CAR!!
... How long have I been out?
They've got it all wrong. They're watching the warehouses, the loading docks, looking for a tamperer. The Joker is supplying tainted ingredients at the source.
Bruce Wayne.  -- I've read your work.  I quite like it.
That's how it is, chum. One column - and I can bring all this tumbling down. I can take you off the streets for good.
Do you want a drink?
Well.  A couple of years ago when their president was requesting aid I went down there for Newsweek. The beaches were nice.  And at nights -- they had a band -- I danced on the hotel patio.  Of course I never saw what was really happening there. When the war broke out I had to go back. And I promised myself that this time... I wouldn't look away.
As much as I do.  It's not that.  I don't want to be depressing, that's all.
But it's not fair.  I'm half drunk and you're not even --
Bruce, at the rate you're going, you can't even save yourself.
It's like the last time. He sent me a present before he --
I'm sorry, she hung up. What are --
Got it all figured, huh?  Grissom just sits back and hands you the reins.  -- Maybe he don't know what we know.
I understand.
And what happens if we say no?
That's it?
Ten million dollars. Ten mi -- YOU CHEAPSKATES! I've just wiped out the stock market. I've cost you billions!  I want ten million and one.
A girl could get killed - - so they tell me.  What's new and hot in Gotham City?
Nice snap, huh?  Pulitzer Prize, 1963.
Oh, Bruce...
Everybody needs a hobby.  You explain it, Vicki.  He walks out on his own party.  Half an hour later, who turns up?  Batman.  Sees an execution, freaks out in an alleyway.  No place to change.
I've had it with you.  I'm leaving.
Ali?  What's wrong?
Shut up, Kevin.  Honey, you-re not making sense ...
David, I'm serious!
It's very good Bernie.
Howls he getting on with the family?
She's ... well, she's good.
Everything okay, David?
And that's where you introduce me to the Governor.
Say that again, son.
I said say that again, son - because the next time you do, I'll make sure you're in there with my daughter, but in a slightly less healthy state and she's in a coma with a broken arm right now.
Ah, David.  Finally.  And this must be our professor from across the sea.
Thank you David.  However, flattery will get you nowhere.  Truth is, I have a rather different plan for Whistler's dear Mama.  Bernie and I have been inspecting our books - and the long and short of it is, we cannot survive with our current losses, so ...
I think you're wrong, David.  She looks as fine as she's ever looked. Worth every cent of the 10 million dollar-s.
And a car.
Bye, Dad.
Oh, heh heh really? Cool. Heh heh.
Uh, huh huh, this is Las Vegas?
Uh, B...A...U... No, uh, V...
Uh... Buuuuut. Boot. Someone named boot.
Huh huh. This says Beavis.
So, uh, huh huh. Are we gonna score now?
This is it, Beavis. Huh huh. We're finally gonna score.
No way butt-hole! I want the window.
That was boring. Huh huh.
Uh... Huh huh. I have a couple. Butt cheeks, huh huh huh.
Yeah, he had a lot of problems. Huh huh huh.
You hear that, Beavis! We're gonna get alcohol, tobacco and guns!
Dill-wad...
Oh yeah. Can you just take us to Washington? We're gonna meet her there and, you know, heh heh hmmm...
Oh, there are so many slots you won't know where to begin.
Hey, Butt-Head, it's that slut from the plane!
Why it's you two. How'd ya do in Vegas?
Does that say Xanax?
We got nothing, Chief. We tore the place apart. We can only legally hold her for another couple of hours.
What the hell...? Bork! That bus we picked up. Where was it headin'?
D.C., Chief.
Chief, I swear, we tore that bus apart. They couldn't have...
Say chief, isn't that guy whose camper,...I mean, off in whose...
One more thing. Mah wife's got this leather satchel. It's black, about this big. I need ya to bring it back. It's real important. Sentimental value... Any questions so far?
Really? That's where we're from.
Helen got it for me in Oslo.
You'd better sit down, hon.
In heaven there wouldn't be dust on the wallpaper.
What's she doing here?
She can't see you, right?  In the book, Rule Number Two: the living usually won't see the dead.
Won't?  Or can't?
We don't know who he is...  ... I'm going to talk to that little girl.
My God, we're back where we started.
Three times.  Powerful number.
Oh, Adam, don't tease her.  You never got an A in science in your life!
Aren't you scared?
<u>Don't say his name</u>!  Just practice. Do it <u>yourself</u>!
You lilly-livered bleeding hearts!
He's a freelance bio-exorcist. Claims to get rid of the living. But he's a troublemaker.  He's pushy.  He's been sleazing around that cemetery for 500 years.
He said if I let him out he would take me over to the other side to find you.
Oh, honey... I didn't mean anything ... it's just too big for you two. I know these things.
Of course they're dead.  They're ghosts.
No, I mean they've gone. Decamped.  Split.  Vanished.
Are you a spirit too?
Yeah.
I... I don't know what your name is.
Breakfast beetle?  Beetle?  Beetle fruit?  Fruit bat?  Fruit battle? Volkswagen?  Fruit wagon?
No I don't.  I don't take orders from smurfs.
He's a cloven-hooved beast!
Otho?
It's <u>Otho</u>!
At least insofar as we have our first casualty.  Me.
Why not?
I was just trying to open the door.  Mrs. Butterfield brought over a skeleton key.
I'll bring the wine... and the business plan.  And Lydia you'll bring the ghosts.
I can't <u>bring</u> the ghosts.  They're not here!
They're... not here anymore.
Not <u>a building</u>!  That's the beauty of it.  I think I can buy the <u>whole town</u>.  These people don't know the value of their property!
<u>You jerks</u>!  That is my art, and it is <u>dangerous</u>!  You think I want to die like that?  Lydia.  Moving is a family affair. So buckle down now and go get Mommy some drugs.
Is the rest of the house as bad as this?
You read my <u>mind</u>!  I love clients who can read my mind.  I don't think people realize how strong a connection there is between interior decoration and the supernatural.
<u>I know</u>... I read your book, <u>The</u> <u>Haunted Tapestries of the Waldorf</u>.
That's Charles' study.  But you don't have to even look in there. He'll love whatever you do to it.  He's such a sheep.
Maybe Charles does.
What's happening to them?
Hellooo!  How's school?
However, with injuries such as this, I have run into minor hemorrhaging, which really isn't too serious at the time, but can cause secondary problems if not looked after.
Yes, Robert. I know about the President.
... It's five of, you'd best get on in there.
Hell yes - walk. You're meeting the President, aren't you?
And you, Benjamin, must be strong and brave for me. Turn over, please.
Stay here? Is that necessary?
How true. Mr. Gardiner may be a welcome change of pace.
Well, Mr. President... They don't quite know what to think.
Yes. I would like to be on that show.
Yes. He's a very careful driver.
Your family doctor?
I agree.
I would like to watch television.
Oh, by the way - I'm Eve Rand.
My name is Chance.
Yes.
He was a very wealthy man, he looked after me since I was young.
... I'm...  ... I'm very grateful that you're here, Chauncey...  ... With us ...
I see.
Yes, Eve. I'm very glad that you didn't open.
Yes.
To watch...? To watch me...?
Yes. I like to watch.
Dearest, you uncoil my wants; desire flows within me, and when you watch me my passion dissolves it. You set me free. I reveal myself to myself and I am drenched and purged.
Oh, Chauncey, darling... Where have you been? We thought we'd lost you - we've been looking all over!
Then, I'll be brief. I covered the President's speech at the Financial Institute today, and since the Post would like to be as exact as possible, we would appreciate your comments on the meeting that took place between Mr. Rand, the President and yourself.
I see.
Can you see well?
You must sit with us, my friend, we have much to discuss.
Ben is very ill.
Yes. Tell me, Mr. Gardiner - do you by any chance enjoy Krylov's fables? I ask this because there is something... there is something Krylovian about you.
Yes, it is very good!
We must speak again, Mr. Gardiner, many times!
... We're prisoners, Mr. Gardiner - we're prisoners of tubes and technology.
Yes, Ben. My leg is not very sore.
Yes. I like to watch.
... Did you wish to see someone, sir?
I've never ridden in an automobile.
Yes sir, I guess that's true smallest room in the house.
... The Old Man is getting weaker, Chance.
Well, ain't that the truth...
Yes.
Well, Mr. Gardiner, from the sound of our audience, I'd say that your words are a most welcome respite from what we've been hearing from others...
Yes. Louise will bring me lunch.
Ever since I can remember, since I was a child.
You heard?
Good evening, Mrs. Rand.
Good evening, Wilson.
Oh. Well, I just talked to Cindy this morning. She loves California, but to quote her, she says, 'The Secret Service is getting to be a drag.' I guess she wants her privacy...
... This is another world, Tom - I never would have believed it...
It's that gardener!
Oh? What?
I just wondered if you had gone over my speech, Ben.
I don't know.
Would you check in on Elijah? He seems to be a little under the weather this morning.
We have to make it an early night.
Yeah, just an idea I had.
Hi.
Tom-Tom's puncture wound is infected.
The ferret?
I dressed the wound. Then I've just been feeding everyone, putting everyone to bed.
I have to go back now.
I have to go back tonight. At eight Exactly.
I'm getting rid of the animals. I've lost interest. Besides, they're standing between you and me.
You've always loved the animals.
I'm giving them up. I've changed. I've found a new focus.
You were him last night, weren't you?
Don't forget me.
I'm sorry. That was nasty.
I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm some kind of monster. I'm the guy you read about in the paper and go, "he's some kind of monster."
The monkey.
Holy shit, yes!
Holy shit! He said what I said!
Please have a seat, Mr. Juarez...
Schwartz.
She's not my secretary. She's what they call an executive liaison, and I'm not banging her, if that's what youâ€™re implying.
Thank you for being kind enough to lie. You see, I've been very lonely in my isolated tower of indecipherable speech. You're hired. Any questions?
Dr. Lester, while I am flattered that you share your feelings with me, I believe perhaps the workplace is not the most suitable environment for this type of discussion.
Wife, huh? I'd love to meet her, Craig.
Shall we say dinner on Friday. Just the two of us?  You can come too if you like, Schwartz.
Uh, import-export. Olive oil. Right on 7 1/2 actually.  In the vacant office. So we'll still be seeing each other.
And fifty other lines to get into a girl's pants.
Great.  Buuuhhppaahhhhnnn. . . . . Muhhhahhhhh. . . . . ahhhnnnaaa. . nollltuuukkkaaaaralllll. . . tashabararassssssuuuuusaaaaaaa. . . nnnnnnnaaaaaannnnnnnnncccccceeeeeee Mwaaaaaa. . . . .Mahhhhhkkkkk. . . sssseeeeeen. Maxine?
You married?
So, tell me about yourself. If you can get your mind out of the gutter long enough, dog-boy.
Hi.
What's he been in?
You're evil, Maxine.
Hello. Wendy.
Must you take this terrible demon on yourself, my love?
Can I be anyone I want?
I missed you. I'm sorry. Tell me the plan.
Fine. I mean, it's not like I was doubting you, it's just that I know puppetry is a skill that takes a long time to acquire.
Floris, get Guinness on the phone.
Says me. Do you dream often?
Yes, but you see, someone else was talking through my mouth.
Ouch. Now that's hot. She's using you to channel some dead lesbian lover. Let me know when you're done with her. This is my type of chick.
Count me in.
Tell me, Lotte, can you understand a word I'm saying?
You followed your heart, my child, and that is not necessarily a bad thing.
But now we've lost access to Craig.
Craig stole Maxine from me, Dr. Lester.
Oh, didn't anyone show you the indoctrination video?
J.M. Inc. Be all that someone else can be.
She's not available.
What's the play?
No.
Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!  What the fuck is going on? I'm not talking. This is not me!
I can explain about the portal, darling.
Oh, darling. It's a dream come true. We're going to ride this straight to the top.
Captain Mertin?
But you said...you said out there, there ain't no...what was that word?..no..de- fense. No de-fense.
What world are you talking about? Ain't nothing harmless down here.
Was a time I knew what was.
What'd be the point? Not a house in the country ain't packed to the rafters with some dead Negro's grief. We lucky our ghost is a baby. My husband spirit come back? Or yours? Don't talk to me! Ha..You lucky. You got one child left, still pullin at your skirts. Be thankful. I had eight. Eight with six fathers. Every one of them gone from me. Four taken, four chased and all, I expect, worrying somebody's house into evil. My first born - alls I can remember of her now is how she loved the burned bottom of bread. Her little hands..I wouldn't know'em if they slapped me. Can you beat that? Eight children and that's all I remember.
You don't sit with me!!
You gave me the bad dreams. You left me behind...
Well, is it now? How you getting along?
They treating you right over at the Bodwins?
You grown.
And Paul D...you don't have to stay 'way, but be careful how you talk to my mama, hear?
Morning.
Was over to Baby Suggs.
True.
Yeah. Asked Rev. Pike if he could stay in the cellar.
You know he's colored? What else there to know?
I ain't sure I know that. Baby never laid eyes on her till she showed up here. And how'd she make it and her husband didn't? And where is he? And how she have that baby in the woods by herself? Said a whitewoman help her. Shoot. You believe that? Well, I know what kind of white that was.
She ain't crazy. She love those children. She was trying to outhurt the hurter's all.
What the hell you thinking, girl? Strolling in here this late?
Yes sir.
Plank Road. Yes sir. That's up a ways. Mile, maybe.
Look here..There's a cross up there, so I guess this here's a church or used to be. Seems to me like you ought to show it some respect, you follow me?
Well, enjoy, and perhaps we'll see you again some time, Dude.
We've had some terrible news.  Mr. Lebowski is in seclusion in the West Wing.
Mr. Lebowski is prepared to make a generous offer to you to act as courier once we get instructions for the money.
Can we just rent it from you?
Yes, so we were informed.  However, we must of course transmit the remains to you in a receptacle.
They range up to three thousand.
He peed on the Dude's rug--
They posted the next round of the tournament--
Who has your undies, Walter?
And then they're gonna stamp on it?!
We'll be near the In-and-Out Burger.
Are they gonna hurt us, Walter?
Fuck you man!  You don't like my fucking music, get your own fucking cab!
Please, feel free to inspect them.
That is indeed Mr. Lebowski with the first lady, yes, taken when--
Wonderful woman.  We were very--
I guess he's pretty, uh, racially pretty cool--
Far from it.
Take it easy, Dude.
Howdy do, Dude.
Brother Shamus?  Like an Irish monk?
Oh yeah?
Yes, I know about it.  And I know that you acted as courier.  And let me tell you something:  the whole thing stinks to high heaven.
Do you like sex, Mr. Lebowski?
Excuse me?
Sex.  The physical act of love. Coitus.  Do you like it?
He fixes the cable?
Well--sure, I could do that--
If you successfully do so, I will compensate you to the tune of 1% of the recovered sum.
A hundred.
Do you have any news regarding my father's money?
She most certainly was not!
From who?
Dieter Hauff?
Her "co-star" in the beaver picture?
Roy Orbison. . . Pink Floyd.
Tell me a little about yourself, Jeffrey.
It's a complicated case, Maude. Lotta ins, lotta outs.  Fortunately I've been adhering to a pretty strict, uh, drug regimen to keep my mind, you know, limber.  I'm real fucking close to your father's money, real fucking close.  It's just--
No no, the wealth was all Mother's.
Well yes, what did you think this was all about?  Fun and games?
Well...no, of course not--
So...that doctor.
No, the, uh, police chief of Malibu. A real reactionary. . . So your father. . . Oh man, I get it!
Way to go, Dude.  If you will it, it is no dream.
Come on Walter, it's just--it's Smokey.  So his toe slipped over a little, it's just a game.
Huh?
What the fuck is going on there?
Easy, Dude.
Yeah.  That's a great plan, Walter. That's fucking ingenious, if I understand it correctly.  That's a Swiss fucking watch.
We can't do that, Dude.  That fucks up our plan.
Your wheel, Dude!  I'm rolling out!
Walter, what'm I gonna tell Lebowski?
Lady, I got buddies who died face- down in the muck so you and I could enjoy this family restaurant!
They kept saying they believe in nothing.
Yeah.
No, I'm--
Fucking Arthur Digby Sellers wrote 156 episodes, Dude.
The bulk of the series.
I can't drive, Dude, it's erev shabbas.
What's your point, Dude?
Shit yeah!
Huh?
What the fuck are you talking about?
Yeah, and you were--
It's all over, man!  We call your fucking bluff!
Fuck you.  Fuck the three of you.
Hy God!  They shot him, Walter!
Dude, this is Smokey.  Look, I don't wanna be a hard-on about this, and I know it wasn't your fault, but I just thought it was fair to tell you that Gene and I will be submitting this to the League and asking them to set aside the round.  Or maybe forfeit it to us--
Shit!
Well sir, it's this rug I have, really tied the room together-
Look, let me explain something. I'm not Mr. Lebowski;  you're Mr. Lebowski.  I'm the Dude.  So that's what  you  call me.  That, or Duder. His  Dudeness.  Or El Duderino, if, you know, you're not into the whole brevity thing--
Bunny Lebowski. . . She is the light of my life.  Are you surprised at my tears, sir?
Well we--I don't--
Why?
Seems like he's doing me a favor, then.
What the hell are you doing, Blade?
What was that?
Get real.  I was useful to Damaskinos as long as the hunt was still on.  Now that it's over, all bets are off.
I agree.  We play along for now, we might wind up learning something about how their world ticks.
What's your problem, Whistler?
I did some checking on that Carter Stevens character.  That familiar of theirs who claimed he was with the NIH? Turns out he used to work for them, but he doesn't anymore.
So that's down and dirty.  Got anything to say for yourself?
Getting your attention, Paco.
We want to attract them, not scare them off.
His name is Jared Nomak.
We're locked in.
Not that I'm in contact with.
No --  Does that mean I can't be a donor?
Tell me something, Skid --
Scud.
Tweaked the phosphor rod, modified the collimated beam, wanna concentrate the light, get something like a UV laser going.
Going on twenty years now.
I had to increase the dose. You're building up a resistance to the serum --
Who dies first?
You're blind --
But I just got here --
-- he's a vampire.
Why?
Looks like we hit pay-dirt. This place is crawling with them.  See the valets over there? They're vampires. So is the doorman.
Like what?
Are you all right?
I've been better --
It won't work on you.
I never imagined I'd be so happy to see the sun rise --  It's over, isn't it?
Deacon brought me back.
The red blood cells are biconvex, which is theoretically impossible. They're hypochromic, there's virtually no hemoglobin in them.  Look at the PMNs, they're binucleated, they should be mononucleated.
Five minutes, not a second more. And I don't want to hear a word about "us".
What?
The shadows suit us, Frost. We've existed this way for thousands of years. Who are you to challenge our ways?
Why do you hunt them?
How did you escape?
I don't...I don't understand them myself.
Look, this is not my field of expertise. You seem stabilized, but why take any chances? Let's keep you overnight and have the Staff obstetrician do a follow-up tomorrow.
--it's called "morning sickness," asshole--
I dunno, probably right up there, based on her resume.
Where they found the backpacks and all the film a year later.
Nothing. I dunno--
What?
What'd you dream?
Are you marked like this??
--Christ, they find out I let you have it for the weekend--
<u>One</u> set. Everything from midnight on--
Oh, who did then? Blair Witch? Snatching equipment to make her own sequel?
Turn the tapes back on.
Okay, a blur.
If I could do that, I'd be at the goddamn racetrack, not here.
I got a friend at a Lab. I could get the whole thing blown-up, enhanced--
So where the hell am I going to sleep?
--yeah, a hand or something--
Same trees. They took Elly Kedward out to the same kind of trees.
Cotter?
It's <u>freezing</u>.
--I saw what I saw.
Be it still alive, James?
Who?
--I don't trust anybody, not even me, anymore--
Hold this.
--they're from UMass, doing some kind of fucking term paper--
They're making "Blair Witch II," too.
What--
What'd you see?
You gonna be alright?
Get some more beer.
Heather.
Yeah.
We are being fucked with here, someone or something.
Check the monitor, she's <u>fine</u>.
Anna--
It's <u>possible</u> for chrissake--
--it's urgent!
Could I tell him what it's regarding?
I'm talking to Taos, New Mexico--
Where... where you going?
Who was it?
...I don't know if you can fire a psychiatrist, exactly.
Thanks.
Except when he doesn't say things they're usually nasty.
...You ever get tired?
...You all right?
Okay, see ya... Thanks, Ray.
Why didn't you get into bed?
I... I mean what're you talking about, Ray? I haven't done anything funny.
Tell him the channels, Dusty.
Well, I'm only an employee, I ain't married to him.
Ray. Did you mean that, what you said before, or were you just being a gentleman?
Well... if you're not gonna fire me I might as well quit.
...Gee, I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me what you want me to do or is it a secret?
I didn't say that.  Well?
Well what?
So, uh... this wouldn't interest you.
I'm supposed to do a murder--two murders--and just trust you not to go simple on me and do something stupid. I mean real stupid. Now why should I trust you?
Yeah...
Dead, huh?
...it's too damn risky.
No, he's off tonight. Where was he last night?
The point is we don't serve niggers here.
No. I think I'll stay right here in hell.
Meurice. Sorry I didn't show last night.
Is Marty here?
He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. there behind Vista, I found an ear.
By the way, Jeffrey, this story isn't going to the press and I'm going to ask you to consider all you've heard strictly confidential. Do not discuss this business with anyone, but me, or other police personnel. Got it?
I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
I was. an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
Well.
I made it go down the toilet.
You don't?
It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.
. I. uh.
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.
Who is Don?
. or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
Frank is coming?
What do you want to do?
I'm doing it.
You like to open me. don't you?
There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. there is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. in every hole. It's opening me to a death.
Yes.
Okay. soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
It's okay. it's okay.
Hold me, Don.
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
Here's to Ben.
Nothing.
Don't be a good neighbor to her or I'm gonna send you a love letter. straight from my heart, fucker. You know what a love letter is? It's a bullet. straight from my gun, fucker. Once you get a love letter from me, you're fucked forever. Understand, Fuck?
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes. pour the fuckin' beer.
What else is new?. right?
The ear is from a missing person maybe?
I've gotta go in.
I'm here, aren't I?
It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
What will I say when she comes to the door?
Yes. I do.
I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do?
Oh, okay. can I call?
Okay. yeah, call.
Look. it can wait till Sunday.
Okay. thanks.
That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you. okay?
You want a Dairy Queen?
You want to tell me about it?
Yeah I guess so.  You're a neat girl.
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
You want to dance?
No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
Go ahead.
uh uh.
Good to see you, son.
Where's all your things, Jeffrey?
Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.
Jeffrey, when you see your father.
Yeah?
It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
Can I use the car tonight?
Looks like you'd make a good runner.
Hello. uh. my name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in?
Would you like a piece of cake?
Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?
No honey, I'm alright.
Five-thousand per kilo.
Blanca, por favor.
Nothing like this back home.
You happy, baby?
I'm taking you to the doctor when we get home, and I don't want to hear any arguments.
What?  You're not going to wait for me?
Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical.
Something about vengance being best served cold.
What details?  I put the coke in the false bottoms and take it through customs.
Whose cloths?  Your clothes?
Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
Goodness.
Half a million for you.  Half a million for me.  One-point-three five for the Colombians.
I don't like a lot of conversation, Diego.
Oh, come on, George.  If we are to be friends, we must trust each other.
Getting it here is no problem.  Trust me.  I'll fly it in myself if I have to. What about supply?  How much can we get?
Four passenger, single engine Cessna.
How are we doing?
George.
Jesus Christ, George, I don't see you in two years, and you show up at my door with a hundred and ten pounds of cocaine?
Fuck it.  I'm not counting it again.
What do you need my connection for, Diego?  What are you going to do with it?
Everything is not alright.  I bring you in, and you slap my fucking face!
I did not.
G-d, son.
Un sapo?
Un rata - no good.  But he could have run, fled the country.  Gone to the policia.  But then his wife, his children, his parents, his friends, many people would die.
But, never mind.  I am thinking we can do much together.  This problem with Diego, the stolen car, the jail, is very silly business.  To release him from the carcel, it causes me much inconvenience. The fifty kilos could have been a big problem.  And I don't like problems.
Freedom.
Keep them coming.
Money.
Yeah, Dad.  I really did.  What am I gonna do?
Dad.
...you sonofabitch.  Putting on George's boots.
Don't be stupid, George.  We've got him. We've got him dead to rights.  But like I said, this is top priority so we're handing out free passes on this one. And the first one's got your name on it. Cut your sentence in half, maybe more.
George.
Figured what out?
Hello.
Where are you going?
Fuck you, George, just fucking drive.
Yeah, so I've been thinking.  I love her, y'know?  I kind of want to have her.  I've been away for so long.  Make up for the missed time, you know?
Mirtha, what's going on?  Everything okay with Kristina?
Yeah.
Mirtha, how are you doing?
Everything's gonna be okay, sweetheart. Don't be upset.
What are you doing here?
Yeah.
I love you.  I love you so much.  You've got to know that.  You've got to know.
Yes, I do.
Ramon tells me you are looking for some mota.
Good to see you, Jorge.  You are a man of your word.
So?
Let's try to be precise then. The word "torture" does not appear in our orders. We have always spoken of interrogation as the only valid method in a police operation directed against unknown enemies. As for the NLF, they request that their members, in the event of capture, should maintain silence for twenty-four hours, and then, they may talk. Thus, the organization has already had the time necessary to render useless any information furnished ... What type of interrogation should we choose? ... the one the courts use for a crime of homicide which drags on for months?
Sid Ahmed.
What "group"?
I don't even know your name yet ...
No, immediately. The people are demoralized. Leave this to me ...
Where's Kader?
No, and neither were my men.
Tell me ... Where is this rue de ThÃ¨bes?
And so the tapeworm no longer has a head. Are you satisfied, Mathieu? In Algiers everything should be over.
We'll lower a basket from the window ...
Are you ready, colonel?
Yeah -- I hear they had 'em a real dog and pony show going on up there - -  I'll tell you, sometimes white people are a real puzzle to me.  I mean, did this old guy really think he was gonna be able to keep up with a sweet little number like that?
I just wanted to introduce myself and inform Miss Lawson that there will be an inquiry.
About three hours.
A massive cardiac arrest.
-- And if he were in the midst of making love while under the influence of cocaine?
What did they argue about?
Objection, Your Honor.
She planned this.  She wanted us to find the nasal spray.
I don't buy it and neither will a jury.
You've been following me?
Miss Braslow -- I'm District Attorney John Cardenas.  You arrived at what time tonight?
Yes.
Did you see Mr. Marsh the day before his death?
Yes.
Horrible.  He was tired and pale.
She was here?
No.  She stopped by to pick up some papers.
He did everything he could to take care of his heart?
How would you describe your sex life with Miss Lawson?
What happened next?
Why not?
Why do you think she left you?
When you say your sexual relations with Miss Lawson were intense what exactly do you mean?
Can you give the court an example?
Who was your primary beneficiary?
Did you ever see her again after that?
What kind of information?
And after that didn't you continuously harass Miss Lawson?
You'll be sorry?
You're still angry, aren't you? Isn't it true that your whole story is nothing more than a vindictive attempt on your behalf to get back at Miss Lawson?
Chinese peony root.
How do you instruct your patients to take it?
October twenty-seventh.
No.
Did he make your life miserable?
What happened next?
While I was seeing Dr. Paley I mentioned to him one night that someone was stealing drugs from the third floor dispensary.   Three days after I spoke to him in his office he went to the Head Nurse and told her he had witnessed me stealing drugs.
Could you repeat the last part of what Mr. Marsh said to you the day before his death?
Yes.
Yes.
There's an item you picked up that's marked.  Will you read it?
Would you read for us the time of the purchase?
Isn't it true that you stopped by the house after you left the drug store and dropped off the items you bought?
I'm not asking for names or specifics.  I just want to know what prompted you to make the call?
And didn't Miss Lawson come home one day and find you in bed with your male lover?
Hi.  It's Frank.
It's going to be hard to convince a jury that he's testifying against you in a murder trial because you blew him off.
Is that what you think I was thinking?
I'm sure you'll be able to handle him.
Don't worry about Paley.  He can't touch me.  No one can.  I've thought it all out.
What's that for?
I knew you were thinking that.  I could see it in your eyes today in the courtroom.  You're wrong, Frank. I need you to believe that.
How's it supposed to work Rebecca? You and Paley celebrate your victory. You get me over here and provoke a fight so he has to rush in and save you -- but then he's given himself away as your accomplice -- now he has to kill me.  After that I figure she'll tell the Police that you broke in.  That you were crazed because we humiliated you in court?
Well, that's kind of how I am right now.
Mr. Dulaney, before you cast aspersions on the District Attorney's Office by suggesting they've coaxed this witness to say things that aren't true -- you better have more than a hunch.  Do you?
You're on vacation, remember?  You're supposed to be relaxing.
Why don't you talk to him now?
Is that alright, Frank?
Sharon, it's late.  Can we get to the point?
I'm not.
I was thinking that when the trial is over we'd all go skiing for a weekend.
It was a place to start.
That's too bad.
Maybe it's an Italian thing. Their mother was Italian.
Carolyn -- you want these candlesticks?
I thought everything WAS arranged.
"-- going over and over in my mind every detail, every moment of our time together and I ask myself, "What happened to me in Madison County?" I struggle to put it together in a way that allows me to continue knowing we're on separate roads. But then I look through the lens of my camera, and you're there. I start to write an article and I find myself writing it to you. It's clear to me now we have been moving towards each other, towards those four days, all our lives --
What's he saying now?
What?
Well, what am I supposed to think?
How did she meet him? Did Dad know? Anything else in that envelope?
"... It's all there in the three notebooks. Read them in order. If you don't want to, I suppose that's okay too. But in that case I want you to know something -- I never stopped loving your father. He was a very good man. It's just that my love for Robert was different. He brought out something in me no one had ever brought out before, or since. He made me feel like a woman in a way few women, maybe more, ever experience..."
Well, I'd like to read them.
I had no idea it's gotten that bad, sis.
I found out who Lucy Delaney is.  Remember the Delaneys from Hillcrest Road?
Nobody did.
Was this during Betty?
Only about a thousand times. What do I do now? "What's good enough for mom is good enough for me?"
-- for over twenty years because that's what I was taught -- you stick with it! Normal people don't get divorced. I can't remember the last time my husband made love to me so intensely that he transported me to Europe, for Christ's sake -- quite frankly, I don't think he ever did! And now I find out in between bake sales, my mother was Anais Nin!
Oh, this heat! Times like this I wish we took that offer from your brother and moved on up to Michigan.
Not this kind of heat.
Heat is not heat! There's different kinds! And this heat is much hotter than what they got in Michigan. You go and call your brother and see if he don't say the same thing.
Roseman Bridge?
Maybe it's because I live here.
Small town on the Eastern side no one's ever heard of called Bari.
Oh yeah, Bari. I've been there.
Oh there you are.
About a year and a half.
Everything does. One of the laws of nature. People are always so afraid of change. But if you look at it like it's something you can count on happening, it's actually a comfort. Not many things you can count on for sure.
And clean.
Is the dizziness gone?
I better go. You sure you're all right?  It's been a pleasure. Sincerely.
Nah. I've tried. My writing's too technical, I think. Problem of being a journalist too long is you stop giving yourself permission to invent. I better just stick to making pictures.
Why, do you think?
No. I'll do them later.
Never touch the stuff. I've got friends all over the world. Good friends I can see when I want, if I want.
No, I think I need everyone! I love people. I want to meet them all! I just think there are too many out there saying "This is mine." or "She's mine." Too many lines have been drawn. World's breaking apart because of man's weakness for some testosterone conquests over territory and power and people. He wants control over what deep down he knows he has no control over whatsoever and it scares him silly.
Wonderful. Uh...
I'll pick you up.
No. I'll drive myself. I have a few errands. I'll meet you there.
I uh... I had lunch in town today. Happened to cross paths with "that Redfield woman." I apologize. I thought you were half-joking about that.
Can I help?
Are you comfortable?  Do you... want to move to the bedroom?
I just feel like I'm getting a little ... out of control that's all. It's kind of frightening.
I bet you could do a book.
I had a temper.
Well, what is this?
How do you know what I experience?
Fine. More eggs or should we just fuck on the linoleum one last time?
For who?
His family's lived for almost a hundred years. Richard doesn't know how to live anywhere else. And the kids...
No, they don't say much. But Carolyn's 16. She's just about to find out about all this for herself -- she's going to fall in love, she's going to try and figure out how to build a life with someone. If I leave what does that say to her?
Francesca, listen to me. You think what's happened to us happens to just anybody? What we feel for each other? How much we feel? We're not even two separate people anymore. Some people search their whole lives for it and wind up alone -- most people don't even think it exists and you're going to tell me that giving it up is the right thing to do? That staying here alone in a marriage, alone in a town you hate, in a house you don't feel apart of anymore -- you're telling me that's the right thing to do!?
Mrs. Johnson! Mrs. Johnson! Is it true Cary Grant has proposed to you?
Are you seeing Betty tonight?
What's her name?
Oh my God...!
Your mother left explicit instructions that she wished to be cremated.
Take my advice.  And shoot that dog.  Or let me.
What the hell you talking about?
Yeah, we can.  Least till after this weekend.  He ain't going nowhere.  We'll deal with it then.
Yeah, but I ain't talking horse.  I'm talking about a five-dollar kick in the head that's a quick ticket to heaven. And the fools keep coming back for more.
Don't need luck tonight.  I'm just letting 'em have their say before I say no.
Nothing but net?  Could be a swish.  Or a muthafucking air ball.
All the more reason I should be here.
You got his hands.  Beautiful hands.  I didn't even know.  That night.  When they - we - killed him, that you were already alive inside me.  Life's like that. Grows right out of death.
But if it's him.  If he's really come back, won't he know us?  Love us?
Eddie Mack, that cop.  And Jeremiah.  And even when he's done, who knows.  He won't be satisfied.  Just like that demon dog. Feed it, and it just grows hungrier. Feed his hunger for revenge - he just wants more.  Who knows where it'll stop. That kind of hunger ain't never satisfied.
I don't.  Patrick doesn't.  And his brother and sister don't.  And they're in the house with him.
No.  It goes way back.  Or so my Momma says.
He probably thinks he's saving you from something.  I'm sure that's what my mother thinks.
Patrick, he's...
I thought you'd be psyched.  Just trying to do what you did.  Take nothing and make something out of it.
No one'll ever come here.  Shut it down. Don't worry, the bank'll buy it back. I'll take care of it.
I saw your face.  You knew that place. You knew those people.
Please...help me...
What the hell do you want?
Look, even if anyone found anything there, it's twenty years ago.  They could never connect it to us.
I ain't killed nobody.  Shall I rack 'em?  Play a game, Lupe?
Oh, no.  Please don't make me go by myself.  I'm scaaaaaaaaaared.
That you stole off those white boys was down here last night?  Are you crazy? Everybody from hell to breakfast heard that screamin' on Blackstone last night!
Sqweeep.  We innerup this programme to bring you this special news bulletin --  "Aliens from Reticula 3 have hijacked Patrick Peet and injected moly headcheese into his skull filling his entire brain cavity with cosmic slop..."
"Like a heartbeat/Like a love beat." Listen to the Di Franco twins there. Just the plumbing or something, fool.
And some people need their medication tweaked.
Boy, put that thing down.  You can't take that.  Might be evidence.
I think you're fucking crazy!
Where's what?
So, you just got out?
Where the hell's the laundry detergent?
No!  They're still on their way.
But you know he did it.
No.  Johnnie's got it.  All I got to do is get it back.
Caesar, this is crazy.
Caesar ...
Tell them!  Tell them!
...  maybe three hours.
Fuck.
I had to.  You made me.
You know he would have done you, too.
Caesar, don't.
Not on duty, sorry.
You can't kill me yet.
I started thinking maybe it's about the money so I call you, but all I get is the busy signal.  I figure the phone is off the hook, that's why I come rushing over here.
Un-fucking-believable.  I called those highway patrol dumb fucks.
Yeah, sure.  I'm Corky.
Not exactly.
I'm sorry, I usually would call Rajeev, but I didn't know what to do so I called Mr. Bianchinni.
What do you want?
Why?
Look, I don't think this is a good idea.
Yes there is.  I felt it this morning when I brought you the coffee.
We're not that different, Corky.
Shelly was skimming from the business. He came to see me yesterday because he was afraid Caesar figured it out. He wanted to run but he wanted me to come with him.
Even though he knew about you?
You made a choice once.  Do you think you would make that same choice again?
Caesar is going to get the money and bring --
You think I'm lying?
All right, now, tell me about Johnnie.
Yeah.
It's getting better and better. Keep going.
Gino doesn't know English, or at least he pretends he doesn't, so he doesn't talk much.  He gets right to the point.  Both times they talked for about five minutes, had one drink and then they left.
What time did you say they would be there?
There is no going back.
Why?
He'll have to run.
If he runs, everyone will assume he took the money.
Thank you.
I had a partner and she fucked me.
Oh, Christ, I got to get out of here!
How'd it go?
You shouldn't have to see this.  Why don't you get out of here?  Go for a walk.
Oh my God.  Was anyone hurt?
We're talking about Marseille. We're talking about Nykwana Wombosi. And I'm asking you if this abortion in Marseille has anything to do with Treadstone.  Was this Treadstone?
And what if I couldn't do that?
I want a second opinion.
Forget it.
You just blew up a house in Paris! This program is over.  Call it off.
I won't ask again.
<u>There never was a Jason Bourne</u>.  You have to come with me.  It's the only way.  We can give it back to you...
Jason...  They can't let you go...
I think investment advice from a dead man, it's a bad idea.  How does it feel to be dead?
I have a passport.  I've got...  Actually, it's a little complicated.
Yes, sir...  How can I help you?
Bonjour?  Monsieur?  Allo...
Yes.
Yes.
What if I say no?
I don't know.  Smile.  Sneeze. Something.  You've got a bag full of money and a ride to Paris.  Fuck it, I don't know...  What kind of music do you like?
Look, go ahead...put the radio on...
What are you talking about?
You ever think maybe you have a family?
Four-fifty.  That's the address...
Look, you could come up.  Or you could wait if you want.  I could go check it out.  You could wait.
-- what're you doing? -- Jason, please, tell me what's happening!
What? -- what? --  -- what is it?
...this is my picture... he's got my picture --  -- this is me -- this is Zurich -- this...this...this is yesterday --
He went out the window -- why? -- why would someone do that?
But the police --
-- there's no time --
-- there's two of us -- we'll tell them -- we'll just --
What is that?
What about you?
Where did this body go?
-- we have rules here, this is a very serious place -- I'm the one who decides who gets in here, okay? --
Where's the dog?
He run away often?
-- I'm the one that got ripped off! -- not you -- not the United States government -- me -- I'm the one being ripped off!
That's the only angle.
What do they have on the streets? The area.  They must have something.
Sir...
What?
-- we're evacuating the building --
You're awake.  Can you hear me?  You've been shot.  I'm trying to help you.  You were in the water.  You've been shot.  It's okay now.
How did I get here?
...Be back.
...ergency procedures.
...your ducts?
...ven't you?
This is what you get when you have cowboys round yer ducts.
Ah ha ... there you are, Sam.
What? You mean you've got ...
Yes, I know. It's the backlog, everybody complains. Was it all right otherwise?
Too late? That's for me to say.
Long time no see!
Well, since you disappeared up the ladder of Information Retrieval ... I don't expect to see you slumming in Records - what's the problem?
Problem? - No problem - yes, everything's going fantastically well, wonderful, marvelous, great career prospects, Alison in great shape, kids fine, beautiful home, I'm on Security Level Five now, and Mr Helpmann relies on me more and more, yes, couldn't be better, I feel terrifically motivated and job- rewarded -
Triplets.
Ah ...
OK. Come back this afternoon, about four o'clock. If you give me the number of the case, I'll have the dossier here waiting.  My tailor,... well worth the investment.
What is it?
Am I?
Please, Sam, we're going to have to be open to each other on this one. If you make a reputation with this case, it'll be at my expense.
How do you mean?
I did not get the wrong man. I got the right man. The wrong man was delivered to me as the right man! I accepted him, on trust, as the right man. Was I wrong? Anyway, to add to the confusion, he died on us. Which, had he been the right man, he wouldn't have done.
We suspect him of freelance subversion.
But surely, I mean, perhaps she just happened to live above the Buttles, and ...
So what are you going to do about her?
Let me try to get to her. I'll deactivate her.
There's no procedure for that until she's been arrested.
Well, I'd better get out there and try to get to her before security does. Let me borrow her dossier for a while.
She's innocent, Jack --- she's done nothing wrong.
What?
Stamped?
Don't look back! Act naturally!
Bloody hell! Do as I say!
Oh. But ... Look, I'm sorry I shouted at you.
Yes. Ceiling. Why did you run away?
What's going on here?
It's heavy.
Well, terrorists of course.
Cut it out, Sam.
Go away.
Leave me alone!
It's not the machine. There's a mismatch on the personnel code numbers... Ah there we go! That's a B58/732 when it should be a T47/215 ... Tuttle ... he should have Â£31.06, debited against his account for electrical procedures, not Buttle.
Information Retrieval.
But if they did promote you
Would you really, Sam?
Send it to somebody else. Send it to Buttle. It's his cheque.
Dead! Oh no! That's terrible! We'll never get rid of the damned thing! What are we going to do?
Here. What do I do next?
Is it all right about Mrs Buttle's cheque?
I delivered it.
Can I forget it?
All information on 3rd Level Suspects is classified.
It's what you wanted isn't it?
Ah, yes, you're the new boy from next door, ha ha!  My name's Lime. Harvey Lime. Welcome to Expediting.
This isn't rare!
Of course. Isn't it wonderful? The bandages came of this afternoon. Come and join the fun. Everybody's here.
Mother? ... What ... what's ... you've got to help me ...
What have you done with his body?
Monsieur. Quel numero.
what? ... Oh ... 
Yes?
Have you got one or haven't you?
What is it?
... but, with all the new rules and regulations ... unncgh, c'mon, c'mon ... they can't get decent staff any more ... so ... they tend to turn a blind eye ... as long as I'm careful.  ... Mind you, if ever they could prove I'd been working on their equipment ... well, that's a different matter ... up a bit with the torch, sir.
The pace?
Well I suppose one has to expect a certain amount
You swore you'd fire me if I came in late again.
Es impossible.
Where is she?
She wanted something to help her sleep.
Red Death?  Tell me something, Frank--does killing your clients make good business sense to you? The kids selling that shit have no sense. They'll be taken care of, don't worry about that.
She said to me, I love the way you talk on the radio.
All right, all right, he's been snorting that Red Death stuff. Been going for four days.
Excuse me. You are a very kind man. I can see that. A man like you could not refuse a poor sick dying helpless man a small cup of water.
Do you have any music?
Right now, I'm more worried about my mother than anything. They won't let her see my father.
Our Lady of Misery.
Be tough to get a taxi here. We can give you a ride if you like.
He wants to pull that tube out. It's pretty painful--that's why they keep him sedated--but it's a good sign.
Like everybody else--except us. Always standing on the sidewalk waving goodbye to moving trucks. Your parents ... ?
Mostly. It must be my face. My mother always said I looked like a priest.
If I'm not back in fifteen minutes, hit the buzzer. That way she'll let me go.
You asked me not to come.
Too bad. He called me up today, can you believe that? I don't know how he got my number. He asks me do I want to come over and see him, I tell him I'd rather go to a leper colony. He says there's a new gang that wants to kill him, take over the business. I told him I hope he's right. That they kill him. That's what I told him.
No problem. Thanks for letting me crash. It was the best sleep I've had in months. I used some of your soap.
I wish these people would leave already. I can't listen to another story. Did you see him?  That doctor says the brain is coming around. They're waiting for the heart to stabilize. I don't know who to believe. He says they still have to keep him tied up.
Frank.
The ghosts--
Oh, Frank, you've got it bad, so much worse than I thought.
Nice though, pulling back her hood as we drive by. There's a mystery to it, then she shows you.
We're all whores, Frank. You know what I'm talking about, the way she looked at me.
Three legs.
I quit! I'm through!
He one of them?
The cure's not working, Tom. Maybe we should go back to the hospital.
The brakes are shot.
You need a reason, Frank. You don't just go around breaking people's windows. That's anarchy.
Okay, whatta I do?
Do it!
Oh yeah, you don't eat food.
One-three Zebra. Zebra three, I need you.
...outlaw nation but strangely those who have interviewed Gaddafi find him, in a phrase we like to use in this country, very 'presidential'.
You can't talk about feeling intimidated when you're on top of the world.  It's unseemly.
Okay.  Pretty petty party, isn't it, pal?
Okay, let's drop it.  I didn't mean I'd take a test for you -- I mean if that came up in conversation I'd...
I don't like being handled.
You were smokin' toward the end there.
You packing up tonight?
Yes.  And I'm sorry that they're sending you down for a while, but you'll make it back...Where they sending you?
Hold it down, okay?
If you ever get restless in Portland, let me know.
You're saying the fact that you're gay had something directly to do with your promotions?
A half hour in the lobby.
Okay.  I feel like I'm slipping but do people who are actually slipping feel that way or is it always the really good people who are moving up who invariably think they're slipping because their standards are so high?
This conversation is not worthy of you.
I'd give anything if that were true.
If we don't get to their camp soon, we won't be able to tape the supplies coming in.
I'll tell you later -- where you going to watch from?
Me again.  Hi.  Listen Gaddafi doesn't foam at the mouth or anything.  When you speak to him he's not at all nuts. He seems like a leader -- very impressive, self-control...that's what's so strange.
Well, whatever you think.
I figured out exactly why it is I'm so hung up on getting a chance at weekend anchor...It's because if I do that well, they'll pay me more, treat me great and my life will be better.  That's why.
Yes.
Did you bring your grey suit?
As good as humanly possible.
Me too...Hey...if it gets dull a little before 11:00, drop by the studio.
No.
People phoned in.
Stop kidding.  I want to know what happened.
Aaach...Jane...  Let's take the part that has nothing to do with me.  Let's let me be your most trusted friend, the one that gets to say awful things to you.  You know?
I think you're the Devil.
Yes.
I think so...They've been talking to me about being Tom's Managing Editor.
It's an ethnic curl, I can't do anything about it.
Oh, you mean use him...That's nice.  Okay.
I saw the smile -- good piece.
That's it.  I resign as of now.
Anyway.  I want you to think of this as...
It's what he did.  I'm proud of him.
Just a few questions?
How long has it been since you've been home.
All this business of war -- do you get scared?
Well, darling, if it gets any better than that, I'm going to have to bring you up here to New York.
What did he say?
It's Aaron.
Look, I can start up with him again if you really...
I'll speak to you.
Ernie, they're calling from work.
Tell me I'm on the way in.
What?
I just have two more pen pals and then I'm done.
I got my report card.  Three Cs, two Ds and an incomplete.
I had no idea she was this good.
I just wanted to tell you  how great you were.  My name's Tom Grunick.
If we could just eat first.
Listen to me.  You keep on thinking I'm somebody ho lacks...confidence. That's not it.  I know I can talk well enough and I'm not bad at making contact with people, but I don't like the feeling that I'm pretending to be a reporter.  And half the time I don't really get the news I'm talking about.  It isn't that I'm down on myself.  Trust me, I stink.
No.  Aaron and I go to Central America on Wednesday -- so I'm cramming.
At work there's always this sort of film over you.
You okay?
Well, I thought I'd check if all of you were still here.  I'll just go in and join the gang and you two go on.
I'm going to have to do a story from beginning to end on my own.
Well, what is it?
If I tell you, can you manage not to put it down or tell me why it won't work or is in bad journalistic taste or anything like that?
Suppose I go in for a little while and you wait in the lobby-bar.  How's that?
It wasn't as bad as he think, was it? -- it wasn't unprecedented or anything?
Then give me a minute...
We disagree on how God-awful it was.  Why don't you come with me and we can disagree and get a tan at the same time?
Jesus, if you're glib about this I'm going to lose it.  I was up all night and...
That's not going to be the way we say good-bye.  Even though I think what you did was rotten -- it's not all impersonal.  You mean something to me.
Well, let's do a special report on that...I mean that's news.
I knew what you meant.
Well, there's a guy, but he says he'll fly up a lot.
Look, I'm junior man -- and it's your beat.
Boy, that's nice...I wish we could all deal with each other like this. I'll check it.  Anything I can do for you?
Would you like to do me?
What, right now?
I already told you I'm not.
Alright we're clear.
Alright I got you, man.  It's my turn for freak patrol.
I've never seen anything like this, maybe Segal, but nothing with such... dichotomy...  It's very good, Walter -
It's a...full length life-size figure!
I mean, you look so pretty.
Well that was for your sculpture of the girl.  Your nude in the chair.
But you gotta love me!  Why do you think I made that statue of Alice?!
Walter...there's...
What?
Here you go, enjoy.
It was.
Walter...I can't believe it.
You've arrived.  You've been recognized.  You're a talent, a creative force to be reckoned with.
Would you pose for me for free?
I mean it's like, you know, I do my art because that's what I am, you know?  I'm an artist.  I'm not like a banker, you know.  Like I create.
Man that's a trippy name, kinda like the Warhol mayhem series...
Looks like that cat paid off in spades.
Man if you want to be a legit artist you have to do nudes, nudes, nudes...
Well that's not what I pay you for, now is it?
Alright get a grip on yourself Now since you're here why don't you start early, the kitchen needs cleaning.
People seem to like my cat.
I don't have another cat!
You know what that proves?
Whatsamatter Leonard?
Maxwell!  He's behind all this with all his stupid blowhard poetry!  Listen, you've got to stop right away!  I'm beginning to feel responsible!
I want that cat.  I'll pay you one thousand dollars - cash.
Hi.  I know you!  I've seen you down at the Jabberjaw plenty.
Did you see my cat?
Is that what that is?  I never seen any before.  I always thought that stuff was expensive!
Who do think you're dealing with, huh?  I'm willing to cut you a break, chief!
Wait a minute - I told you I didn't do nothing wrong!
You're gonna shoot me!
What are ya, deaf?  Turn around!
Hi.
Wheat germ omelette, guava nectar and garbanzo sprinkled with smoked yeast.  Join us?
That's really nice of you Mayolia.
You don't have to do anything!
You reckless imbecile.  This place is ours for the taking and you let yourself... twelve hundred years old and you act like a child.
No, we didn't.
I... feel.... pretty.
Let me in, Pike!  I'm hungry!
He doesn't look fifty.
Oh.  Who's in it?  I know what it is.  It's what's on instead of the movie.
Yeah, I was bailing.  I have a friend, and he's really... well, he's really vampire, I guess.  Bad scene.
I didn't expect to see you.
It's not a mixer.  It's the senior dance.  And it's important.  You wouldn't understand.
You got that right.  I thought you wanted to kill vampires.
Right.  I'm the chosen one.  And I choose to be shopping.
Are you okay?
Can't.  History report.  The Normans and the Saxons.
What are we doing?
What did Jeffrey's dad say?
What are you talking about?
Just stay away from me, okay?
I had a dream once where I was... There was like, knights in it, and I worked in this bar.  And I... was fighting.  I'm always fighting. And there's a guy...  He's not always there, but he's horrible, all white, and he's always... trying to kill me.
They can't come in, right?  Unless you invite them.  Is that true?
Do you know what a Vampire-King is?
Oh, yes.  And the man from your dreams.  Lothos.
In a way, yes.  Your fate is inexorably connected to them.
Here?
Who we gonna beat?
And you caught it!  Only the chosen one could have done that.
Don't you see what's happening? You're changing.  You've got powers you've only just begun to tap. Physical, mental prowess you've never dreamed of.  God, this hurts.  I've administered a few shocks to your system to start the adrenaline working.  I'm sorry I have to take so many shortcuts in the training process.
Two days ago, would you have even hit me?  Let alone so powerfully?
Oh, several.  Lucretia Borgia, Joseph Mengele, Franklin Pangborn... are any of those names familiar?
What!?!
Fine.
Does the world 'Duhh' mean anything to you?
Five?
It isn't important.
Well... there's my keen fashion sense, for one.
We call them zippers.  They're not supposed to be a challenge.
Make time, okay?  You're the one who told me to act normal.  I've missed three practices already.  If I'm not there for the Barber game tomorrow everyone's gonna talk.
Another distraction.  It's not right.
I don't get it.
No, wait.  I can be dumb.  Really. Or mean, or whatever.  I can learn. I'm useful.
What are you grinning at?  You think I was scared?
And Spring Fling.
Omniplex?
Pike isn't a name.  It's a fish.
And the January Semi-formal --
No...  You want me to give him a message?
All right.  Take care of yourself.
God, I never thought of that.
You've been pitching out of the wrong side of your brain.  These'll help move things to the right side.
What is this "I, I, I" stuff? You only talk about yourself? Aren't you glad to see me?  Don't I look nice?
My right nostril?
God...I think I'm gonna be sick--
Get over here.
How 'bout a back rub?
I'll tuck you in.
You can't seduce me.
Yes I do...
I did.
He did?
I'd like you to meet my father.
I'm Crash Davis.
I thought you wanted an "uncomplicated" boy?
I'm ready for a complicated man.
Thurman Munson.  He was covered with dirt and he was fighting with everybody--it was beautiful ...  And he called the ump a cocksucker and got thrown out of the game even though it was an exhibition!  So I stayed in the bleachers all spring and gradually came to understand what's so great about baseball.
It's true, It's true!  Least it used to be true.  It ain't possible that baseball's not enough anymore, is it, Crash?
No.
Well...I used to think that wasn't the worst thing in the world to look forward to.  Lately I'm not so sure.
How come in former lifetimes, everybody was someone famous?  How come nobody ever says they were Joe Schmo?
Oh dear....easy honey...
Let's have a quick word of prayer, right here, to thank the Lord for all this--
No, no, no.  Put it back on and take it off slowly.
We gonna fuck or what?
You a God damn witch?
It was a cocksucking call!
Did you call me a cocksucker?
You're in the wrong business, Jack--you're Sears-Roebuck material!
Beg me again!
Hey!  What're you guys doing here-- stealing my girl?
Why you shaking me off?
"Naw"?  There's ice skaters coming! You ever made love to an ice skater?
Your fastball was up and your curveball was hanging--in the Show they woulda ripped you.
It's time you started working on your interviews.
I'm trying to thank you.
Why are you a fuck?  'Cause you got talent.  I got brains.  But you got talent! You're God damn left arm is worth a million dollars a year.  All my limbs put together are worth 7 cents a pound--and that's for science and dog meat.
Throw it.  C'mon, right in the chest.
Where's Ebby?
What?
You were never my guest?!
But what happens when they do find out?
They ain't sendin' Nicky nowhere.
Watch it, partner, watch it!
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah. I know that.
Hello.
...Rothstein. I want to talk to Ginger. Put her on the phone.
I know she's there. Don't fuck around with me.
Now this is just a signature card.
Amy! Amy, open the door!
When did this happen, honey?
You don't know? What time did your mother do this? When did she leave?
...give him a shot at runnin' a casino and he tries to talk you out of it.
Where the hell did you learn how to deal? 
Somethin', huh?
Be careful. Gaming agents are all over the place.
So what do you think I do? I threw that cocksucker out.
I'm just tellin' you. Don't say I didn't warn you.
It just didn't sink into his head about the Black Book and what it meant. Not being able to go into a casino is just one thing, but being in this book etched your name into the brains of every cop and FBI agent in the state. I mean, you're listed in there with Al Capone. But Nicky didn't care.
Listen, Nick, you gotta understand my situation. I'm responsible for thousands of people. I got a hundred million a year goin' through the place.  It's all over, I'm gonna tell you, it's all over, if I don't get that license.  And believe me, if it goes bad for me, it's gonna go bad for a lot of people, you understand?
No, I don't wanna come -
Yeah.
The point is that she's upset. She's - and you got a fuckin' problem.
Please...
Your fuckin' head is getting' bigger than your casino. That's your problem, pal.
I knew what he wanted, and I didn't want any part of it.
Fuckin' walking around with a big head. You better check yourself...
Yeah, I did want to go on TV. That way I have a forum. I can fight back. I'm known. People see me. They know they can't fuck around with me like they could if I was an unknown. That's right.
You never - ?
Ginger called me.
And what'd she want?
I know. Why didn't you come to me? I mean, this is family, it ain't business. Meanwhile, you make calls back home. Sammy, it makes us look bad out here, you know what I mean? Back and forth, this one and that one, and, in the meantime, she's gone anyway. Am I right?
Before we point the dirty end of the stick at 'ol Don, uh, we better be sure we can prove them charges.
Well, could there be any position... further down the trough?
You see?  Never tells me nothin'. Ace, what do we got on for next week?
Okay. You come by the house?
Charlie, you've gotta - you've gotta stop her!
Never mind the 'sir'. Never mind the 'sir'.
But, sir. Well, I don't know why. I guess, maybe, because she's frightened that if she doesn't lose the weight she may even get fired.
What is it?
Who's this?
Thank you.
You don't know me. What, you've known me, two, three months. What do you know?
You know a lot of happily married people, Sam? 'Cause I don't.
Need a little help with that, Mr Collins?
Oh, fabulous.
Twenty-five thousand? For yourself?
You can trust me.
...on the stuff involving crimes. So on...
...uh-uh-uh - I'm not gonna ask you where you are, just please, put Amy on a plane. Just put her on right away, any plane to get her here right away...
...please. That's all I'm askin' you.
Pretty serious.
Okay?
I bought him a watch too.
Plus, at the most, three suits, a thousand apiece. That still leaves what?  Around ten thousand?
I want you out of here! I want you out of here!
Here. Here. Is this enough money?! Huh?  Will it last you two fuckin' days? Take it, greedy bitch.  Take the fuckin' money you fuckin' want.
Yeah, no kidding. Good! It opens at 9 a.m. Be there!
You're not takin' Amy.
I had a... salad.
She had the same.
...she did what she did and I did what I had to do. But, Jesus, Nicky was the worst thing she could've done.
Listen to me.
Don't you threaten me!
I'm afraid she's gonna destroy stuff.
Listen to me very carefully. There are three ways of doing things around here. The right way, the wrong way, and the way I do it. You understand?
The probability on one-four-reel machine is a million and a half to one. On three machines in a row, it's in the billions.  It cannot happen... would not happen, you fuckin' momo! What's the matter with you!  Didn't you see you were bein' set up on the second win?
You - Wait! You didn't see that you were being set up on the second win?
Listen, you fuckin' yokel, I've had it with you. I've been carryin' your ass in this place ever since I got here. Get your ass and get your things and get out of here.
Can you do it with your left hand?
You're fuckin' right, you made a bad mistake. 'Cause if you come back here - we catch either one of you - we're gonna break your fuckin' heads and you won't walk out of here. You see that fuckin' saw?  We're gonna use it. You don't fuck around in this place. You got it?
Get out of here.
I don't want to go to Europe. I want to go to see The Elephant Man.
I don't want to go to Europe.
No, I don't want one.  Hey, Mr Clark, how you doin'?
Fucker!
Go get a bag, man.
What do you want? It - It's pitch- black out here. It's tin foil.
Now, I want you to get out there and get me singles and doubles, okay? 'Cause that's what's gonna win this game.
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting a -
Yeah, I heard, yeah.
I'm positive.  Remo... things are very fucked up down there, you know?
Yeah, I know. That's why I'm asking. You see, my main concern is Nicky.
Hm.
He's good. He's fine.
No problem.
You got a round figure on it?
So, he put aside some jewelry for me. A lot of jewelry.
Thank you.
I mean, listen, two people don't get along, at some point you gotta call it... I mean, it's none of my business, but I ... I think that's what you gotta do. You gotta take it somewhere -
Oh, you're right, I know.  It's... well, I was just -
Tell me what you were gonna say. Go ahead.
Mm-hm.
I did what you told me to.
Yes, you are.
I do. I need a new sponsor.
I told you this was fuckin' dangerous. Remember I said, 'Ginger, this is a dangerous situation. Be very careful.' You fuckin' yessed me to death.
Oh, well, then, have him killed and get it over with.
All right. Be careful.
You know, I've got to do some shopping afterwards. Do you want to go?
Ginger, I've been watching you all night. You've been stealing from me.
Yes.
Get lost?
Yeah.
So, it's gonna be okay, isn't it?
Every time I ever see you, that's what I see.
We'll go later.
Right.
So, he knows where you are. That means he's sending some guys over here probably right now.
You're done yakkin', okay? You're done yakkin' now?
- back to  Nigeria.  Yeah.
They checked in alone.
Yes, don't worry.
There's more!
Boy, look at this place, huh?
Come here, come here.
She asleep?
...Remo and the guys used to hang out and count their millions.
Yeah, but they're complaining.
Frankie! Frankie, you piece of shit!
Charlie M.
Charlie M? You make me pop your fuckin' eye out of your head to protect that piece of shit? Charlie M? You dumb motherfucker!
Kill me, you fuck, kill me.
How you doin'?
...this, uh, this Commission is prepared to act on a motion denying the Rothstein application.
Again!
...behind my head. They trust that scumbag, I don't. Right now, the way I feel, I'll hit the two of them in the head with a fuckin' shovel.
All right, take it easy now, take it easy.
...done right, you gotta do it yourself.
You say that like an amnesia victim.
Nothing, just a jolt of deja-vu. I think I went out with a guy with a dignified British butler--can't remember how it turned out..
You're probably right.
There's a nice cafe down the street...unless you're afraid of this Catwoman prowling around. We can always dine at the mansion, if..
Oh, it's superb--I mean if you like that fascist nightmare kind of thing...
Stop. We are not having a "duality" conversation. "Ooh, he has a secret side.  Ooh, she has a dark side." Please.  Duality is a joke. You get one, do you understand me?  You get one life. One shot. I'm so tired of women saying "I have an inner strength" or "Deep down, I'm really ambitious." "One day I'll design my own line of clothing and write children's stories, if I can only remember to return the videos I rented last night." If you are something, then you better be out there doing something.  You need to be the same bold thing in the day that you are at night--with maybe a slight clothing change. There is no gray area. The truth is not somewhere in between. There are two sides to every personality, all right--the reality...and the lie. We are not having a "duality" conversation.
At some sanctimonious celebration of condescension. Nothing like appeasing half the population with a two hour luncheon.
Selina Kyle...lovely person.
I better go report this in...
I can. That's not an admission of guilt,  It's just..I knew you had it in you...
I've been looking for you.
I've been looking for you.  Selina Kyle was right. One of us is a psychotic crusader.
Hey, speaking of Wrong Place, Wrong Time.  Lewis Lane to the rescue!
Even the skylight?
God-damn..
Car wash, Captain?
My, the Perpetrator seems to be a bit on the "Wild" side..
I loved you.
Hasn't anyone ever taught you that fighting violence with violence solves nothing.
Ah, the good guys always triumph in the end. It's what allows our children to sleep at night.
Spooky.
You know, my name's not Spooky. It's, it's Rachel.
You're late. I've got some good news and some good news. I'm giving you more hours and the new uniforms came in.
Oh Frank, I'm not anti-male, I'm anti- you. Believe me, there's a difference.  Kelly is designing new uniforms for next week. Pay her and thank her. And is it a rule that the hottest places on the planet have the coldest air conditioning.  There's something out there called 73 degrees, look into it.
How much?
What did--?
Did you try to kill...
You know, now that I hear myself tell it, I'm thinking maybe both of you are messing with me. What, you get the Helmet Monday through Thursday, then Brock takes it for the weekend...
It's seeing-eye dogs, ma'am. If I let the cat stay, will you go out with me?
What kind of name is "Brock Leviathan?"
I never thanked you..the arrow..the motorcycle..the computer disc..You're so different from what I..and so the same.
Do you always listen to what your mother says?  Selina. Something you choose your life. Sometimes your life chooses you.  Save the day..
Hey Buddy!  Can you let me pull over?  Give me some space to pull over.
Don't you have children?
Who's on the phone?
Theo wants to talk again.
Lady, don't let him do it!
Or relieve me of it later.
Put those away.  We can't have marks on his wrists.
That was definitely out of line and totally unprovoked.  I heard you were a hitter.
Shit.  There's the hotel.  You overshot the driveway.
Got your badge?
Any minute.
No.  <u>You</u> don't understand!  You caught me on my cellular on the way to pick up some business associates.  And I've got no time to screw around.
Lady, try making some sense.
What'd you do!  Just pick my number out of the air?
Where'd they take you to?
Then they took the Mercedes away -- with his body in it.
Stop throwing names at me.
26th off Wilshire.
Even if I got there first she wouldn't go with me.
Why isn't anyone answering me?
It never healed.  I called her a lying bitch and everything else and I hung up on her.  "Click." You don't exist.
What bank?
Even if you found us -- what then?
I'm cutting across to Bundy to Brentwood.  That bank is our best bet.  If anybody shows up I could follow them.
Don't say that.
The front door slammed.  Someone went out.  There's a different car starting.
Downstairs.  There must be an extension.  Oh my God --
Hi Lenore.  It's me.  I got you back.  Courtesy of Star 69.  Are you hurt?
That's coming off.  How about the girl?
He's in back.  Lying face down. They haven't hurt him anymore -- but he was crying.  I never heard Jack cry before --
They won't allow that.  It's one at a time.  And you have to be first.
Because a lot of people would've gotten killed.  Probably all the wrong ones.
As they say -- no good deed goes unpunished.
And all that crap about your driver being murdered by a cop --
Naturally you didn't learn your lesson.
Plus names, addresses and I.D. for the lot of you.  We're in this together and I need to know who my partners are.  In case I ever need to roll over on somebody.
259-7881.
Wonderful feeling of security knowing your adversaries are both crippled and unarmed.
That's where this Chicano correctional officer first taught me to slap paint on a canvas.  I could copy any fucking thing he put in front of me.
Who'd ever think, to look at you?
That's a reasonable possibility.
Naturally.
Turns out you did me a favor. You're looking at a rich man.
It's a nice day.  How about the beach?
A large stretch of empty space with no place to hide.  Temescal Canyon parking lot.
Beats yelling our brains out across some parking lot.
You're getting a lot of mileage out of that cellular.
I don't want you within two hundred feet.  Park down by the lifeguard station.  Nobody gets out.
I don't know what you mean.
I still don't see you.
We're waiting on you.
It's in the process.
Negative.
Yeah.  Why don't we?
And if you ditch us we get zilch.
Intelligent question, Nels.  I believe she had plans for both our bodies to be found in close proximity.
I can see the benefit in that.
How do you know?
Better haul ass if we're gonna be inside to greet them.
Who were you talking to?
Since when did you guys start changing tires?
Seems not.
You sure know how to take a lot of punishment.
She wants me to tell you go fuck yourself.
Don't want any of those looks, Col. They don't mean much.
You see that, Col?
Saw it, Dil.
Fuck off, Dave.
Don't be like that --
Jimmy.
Don't throw my clothes out the window!
What?
Who?
You American?
Jimmy.
Everybody wants something.
Yes, thank you.
Now's the time you're meant to do something, isn't it?
You got a special friend, Jimmy?
Shouldn't I go?
Aha.
Even now.
Come on, Dil --
Never let the sun go down on an argument, Jody used to say.
Sorry, darling.
You could?
Sure I do.
Kind of liked you as a girl.
I should have known, shouldn't I?
Probably.
I miss you, Jimmy.
Don't be cruel.
So I got it wrong, then.
What's wrong, Jimmy? Tell me what's wrong --
Dil, this is Jude.
It's her, isn't it?
Kind of.
You'd do anything for me?
You want another haircut, baby?
It's a secret.
You'd like me better that way, Jimmy?
No.
You're no good at this, Jimmy.
You got to forget you ever saw me, Dil.
No.
Don't leave me tonight. Might kill me, too.
Give me a bit more, baby, a bit more.
You know her, Jimmy?
That's wise, Tommy.
We had a court-martial in your absence. They wanted to put a bullet in your head. I pleaded for clemency. Said we should find out what happened first. So what did happen?
He ran. I couldn't shoot him in the back. I tried to catch him. He made it to the road and got hit by a Saracen.
What do you mean?
Leave her out of this.
Give him a cup of tea.
Why?
So it was you all the time.
Just a girl.
Hope not.
Eat something, would you?
So, what do I look like?
You're the one about five ten with the killer smile and the baby face.
Thank you, handsome.
What is it now?
And you know the funny thing?
Ah, c'mere. I want to show you something.
No?
She your wife?
What the fuck were you doing here?
"Go back to your banana tree, nigger." No use telling them I came from Tottenham.
Best game in the world.
That game where a bunch of paddies whack sticks at each other?
Nice to meet you, Fergus.
So what's that supposed to mean?
You lack imagination, Fergus. Think of something more alluring.
But you fellas never get a break, do you?
I don't know her.
A story.
When I was a child...
I thought as a child. But when I became a man I put away childish things...
Why?
Faster than cricket?
I never know nothing.
Electric razor -- comb -- steamship ticket -- fountain pen -- four passports -- toothbrush -- wallet --  key -- what about that?
Reggie -- I think I've found --  are you on?
There is? Well, I can't say I think very much of a silly law like that. Think, Reggie -- please think -- what was written in Charles' notebook?
as outlined in report number three- nine-stroke-five-two of the Western Hemisphere Conference held on March 22 --  no wait! It was last Thursday, five o'clock at the Jardin des Champs- Ã‰lysÃ©es! Adam -- that was it! The garden!
Why? So you can kill me too? Tex is dead, I've seen him! He said Dyle did it!
Reggie -- why won't you listen?
He's -- with the C.I.A. -- I've seen him at the Embassy.
You didn't have to chase me so hard --
Have some, please. I've got...  ...liverwurst -- liverwurst -- chicken and -- liverwurst.
Central Intelligence Agency -- C.I.A.
You're Charles Voss's wife -- now that he's dead you're their only lead.
Thanks very much.
Oh, you've got the money all right -- you just don't know you've got it.
He's hardly my Mr. Dyle.
That's not Carson Dyle.
Go on, please -- five men -- $250,000 -- the French Underground --
Carson was dying so they were forced to leave him. They finally got back to the base, made their report, and waited for the war to end. Only Charles couldn't wait quite as long as the others. He beat them back to the gold, took everything for himself and disappeared. It's taken Gideon, Tex and Scobie all this time to catch up with him again.
Go ahead, Mr. Bartholomew -- I'm listening.
No.
When did you see him -- what time, I mean?
How about if next week some time I put it on a marriage license -- that ought to --
Do I knock or something?
Yes, he is. He was my brother.
Said what?
Serious. When a man gets to be my age that's the last word he ever wants to hear. I don't want to be serious -- and I especially don't want you to be.
They've got Jean-Louis!
Tuesday.
Maybe.
Or Tex?
What makes you think that this somebody will be satisfied with three? He wants it all, Alex -- that means we're in his way, too.
Got you.
Did you ever hear the story of the boy who cried wolf?
But then if we sit back and wait, the field should start narrowing down, shouldn't it? Whoever's left alive at the end will pretty well have sewn up the nomination, wouldn't you say so?
I can explain if you'll just listen. Will you listen?
Go on.
Yes.
How much is it worth?
In human life? In greed? In suffering?
And the last one?
The best for the last -- le chef- d'oeuvre de la collection. The masterpiece. It is the most valuable stamp in the world. It is called 'The Gazette Guyanne.' It was printed by hand on colored paper in 1852 and marked with the initials of the printer.  Today it has a value of $100,000.  Eh, bien -- I am not a thief. I knew there was some mistake. Take them.
You sure nuthin's missin'?
You don't s'pose one o' us has it, like the man said -- I mean, that'd be pretty distasteful -- us bein' vet'rans o' the same war 'n' all.
Leave me alone -- !
But his mother --
We discovered your husband's body lying next to the tracks of the Paris- Bourdeaux railroad line. He was dressed only in his pajamas. Do you know of any reason why he might have wished to leave France?
Leave?
He didn't have one.
I don't know. I suppose so.
I don't know.
Where did he keep his money?
I know.  I'm sorry.
One wallet containing four thousand francs -- one agenda --  -- his last notation was made yesterday -- Thursday --  "Five p.m. -- Jardin des Champs- ElysÃ©es"  Why there?
I don't know. Perhaps he met somebody.
I don't understand.
Oh, la! If I find the treasure, will I win a prize?
Sorry. Which view would you like?
The one you're blocking. This is the last chance I have -- I'm flying back to Paris this afternoon. What's your name?
Good for you.
No, you see, I don't really love him.
Well, you go in and you ask for some toothpaste -- the small size -- and the man brings you the large size. You tell him you wanted the small size but he says the large size is the small size. I always thought the large size was the largest size, but he says that the family size, the economy size and the giant size are all larger than the large size -- that the large size is the smallest size there is.
How do you know?
Well, the idea's right, anyway. Are you going to call me?
You telephoned me to meet you. I've been standing on the corner back there -- waiting for you.
Right there, between your eyes -- see? Worry lines. You're much too young and too pretty to have anything like that. How about making me vice- president in charge of cheering you up?
Stop bullying me. Everybody's bullying me.
What your husband was mixed up in.
How would you like a spanking?
No, they won't -- I won't let them.
Go to sleep -- I'll see you in the morning.
No -- no, I'm don't.
Stop that!
What is it about?
Sylvie -- ? What are you doing here?
We took all the chances. The money belongs to us, not him!
Shoot no, not after all these years.
I think I know how to restore your reputation.
You want me to die? I thought you and I were tight.
You said that two weeks ago.
Ok.
I thought you'd be pleased.
What did you hear?
Nothing. I just picked up the phone to say goodbye to you. You didn't say goodbye.
No!
We need you here. I can bring her in.
What happened?
Hello?
She works at a church?
A bullet to the right cerebellum.
Couldn't tell she going to off herself, huh?
But I shouldn't shut it down?
You fucked me up!
I'm sure you should have failed.
Ok. Should I put my bike in the back of your car?
Of course I'm scared.
Yes.
Not that many.
You watch. There's going to be a hymen holocaust tomorrow. Maybe I'll finally talk to Mark Shale.
You're thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight?
Unless he makes a move during seventh period.
I kind of like the idea that we can all lose it together, on the same night. It'll be a lot less scary. You have to go.
I got to get home.
Everyone's grounded. There's a killer on the loose.
Yes you are. You always do. It's why we broke up. You always hide behind him.
That's not why we broke up.
What are you doing?
Mom?
I don't know. Where did you hear that name.
Where are you going?
I want you to come home with me right now, Jody.
Wait.
What?
The word is Mob.
You're so beautiful.
Hide your laptop here.
You can't bring it.
What, do you work for my boss, dog?
It's a damn postal truck!
Hey, I'm with you on that one, my man. Prick.
...moron.
Aw!  Oh, Jesus.
No, no, no.  You don't need my truck. You need somebody else's truck...
Hey, listen!  Do you know what I think?  I...
Wait, wait, wait.  Hold up.  Hold up.  Look.
I got, like, uh....
Go on.
Yeah, to keep him off my ass.
...-er.
Look...I kinda borrowed the truck from Andy.
Yeah, borrowed!
I'm about to get in your ass like last year's underwear, man.
Okay, okay! 
Ah, one of them's in the back.
Okay!  All right!

 No...
...you.
 
You  snatch that  phone  from me one more time, I'm--
Back up!  Back...
Hey, and what if we  don't make it?!

Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.
Hey, hey!  Whoo!  Okay.
Get over!  Get over!
 I made it.
Shut up!
Oh, Pete.  Oh, shit!  Oh, shit!
No.  Shit.

 Okay.  Okay. 
These'll keep it cold.



You're not dangerous!  You're crazy!  I ain't gettin' in this damn thing!
Then stay...
Keep still.

 All right.  Hey.

See, now why would you do that to a man in my posi-...
...piece of shit was worth.
...there'd be a sales rep desk with my name on it.  But every time something opened up, there'd be some idiot cousin...
...hospital.
Couldn't deal with it.  So I split.
And  things sort of just went downhill from there.
To tell you the truth, you didn't.
...loaded, I didn't buy you as a shoot- ...
...Long.  Somethin' about that look in his eye when he talked about that Elvis...
Split?  I wouldn't get ten...
All right, all right.  Hey, hey.
Hey.   Mason.

 Come on!
Okay.  All right, man.  Okay.
 All right.  Okay.

Okay. 
Go, go, go! 
Go!
Stop.
And Brynner's right on...
...our ass!
Well, hell, the smoke's gonna kill us anyway!
...another way  outta here.    Hey.

They aren't exactly gonna publicize this,  Arlo. 
Excuse me.  I got a bullet in my leg.
Bullshit, yeah.  Well...if we're not gonna be famous, at least this'll be a great story to tell some ladies in a bar or somethin'.
Oh!
Hey, be cool.
Give it to me now, or you'll be dead...
This country trained me to kill...
 ...to Fort McGruder in his truck. 
 ...-onds...with just a fraction of what's in...
You got a prob-...
He's the dude...
All right, gentlemen. We're about done here.  Fine job.
...and selfless actions, you did save millions of lives.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!  Whoo-hoo-hoo!
...-tor Long.
But you have no choice but to follow orders.
...and the government.
I can't say it's a surprise.
Hm.  The wind's northwest.  That oughta be...Seattle.
...maybe even Salt Lake, not to mention Casper...

Radio the bikes.
You have no idea what you're in possession of, do you?

Sir, all potential customers have been informed of the delay.  Fur-...
Get your links set up!
...here!
What about these two?
This river ends at a hydro dam...
...in Missoula.  All we need to do is get to Mason before anyone else does.
We were called in by the Jerome base...
...what, Sam?  Can't I go down to the loading dock for a few hours without coming back to find a major...
You don't think it's that bad, do you, sir?  I mean, Long's spent the last two years developing his defoliant.  The stuff can't even kill crabgrass yet.
Where's their protective...
It's a hundred degrees...
Yeah, they call me Dar-...
...look like you're after something more dangerous.
Actually, I was just looking for a restroom.
And I can't guarantee the end will be quick.


Why?  You're a nothing, nobody!  Why?
...-son.  Of all the days for you to show up late.  First, the idiot April calls in sick.  Then I got a bad tooth...
Oh, no?
You got thirty minutes.
Go.
...now!
Gomez, you fight the battles you can win.  Now, we've been outmaneuvered here.  Brynner's next move is gonna be to get Elvis out of the country and sell him to the highest bidder.  To do that, he has to have planned an exit point.  That's where we intercept him.  That's where we make our play.  Now you and your men back off.
Missoula's reporting the refrigerator truck as a stolen vehicle.  I told you Mason was walking shit.
...-son.

...-time. 
...like a fish.
 No, that's not possible, Mason.  The trout... 
...is a perfect hunter.
Turn the power of the hunter against him.
...is death.
...-to a simple thing like...
...fishin'.
Yeah, I just....

...you, Mason?
Mason.  Mason!
...-lem?
...to talk, son.
...stole a truck under arrest.
...on the other end of this phone.
 Wait.  Listen to me, Pappas.  If you don't let us by...
...tunnel now!
All right, go.


Oh.
Negative.  Negative.
He must've had a damn arsenal in there.
But that means that most of the valley's been sold in the last few months.
Sir, this is not a lending library, it's the Hall of Records.
How did she get that idea?
Do you know him?
My usual fee, plus a bonus if I come up with any results.
...Exactly what do you know about me, Mr. Gittes?
Wouldn't it be useful to talk to her?
Well, you don't look any the worse for wear, Mr. Gittes, I must say... where's the girl?...
That's where life begins... marshes, sloughs, tide-pools... he was fascinated by them...  you know when we first came out here he figured that if you dumped water onto desert sand it would percolate down into the bedrock and stay there, instead of evaporating the way it does in most reservoirs. You'd lose only twenty percent instead of seventy or eighty. He made this city.
I have no idea. How much do you want?
What kind of guy do you think I am?
Gee, this is a surprise, Mr. Gittes.
Curly, where's your car?
Tell Mrs. Mulwray to wait for half an hour after you get there. Then if I don't show, take her down to the boat.
Yes.
Did you know that you're a very wealthy woman?
Well you own a lot of land.
That's just lovely.
The apple core club.
The apple core?
I get by.
If she's not there, you're going downtown, and you're staying there til she shows up.
Mrs. Mulwray, it's a very serious offense pointing that at an officer of the law. It's a felony.
Lou, she will kill you. Let her go for now. You don't know.
But there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?
What do you mean?
May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?
You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.
Nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray, I just --
Sorry. Look, you sue me, your husband dies, you drop the lawsuit like a hot potato, and all of it quicker than wind from a duck's ass. Excuse me. Then you ask me to lie to the police.
My husband.
Mr. Gittes.
I can't tell you.
For very long?
Yes... why?
No, not for that one.
Been meaning to talk to you about that.
Your father is Julian Cross, isn't he?
Not over me. Why would they have a falling out over me?
Oh, yeah?
Everything you can see, everything around us. I was at the Hall of Records today.  That bother you?
Why?
Why?
It was in Chinatown.
I thought I was keeping someone from being hurt and actually I ended up making sure they were hurt.
Where?
Please don't be angry... believe me, it's got nothing to do with you.
Where are you going?
The Albacore Club.
It has to do with my father.
You saw my fa... father? When?
You mean she just found out?
You won't go to the police if I tell you?
Don't worry. I'm not telling anybody about this.
I said I want the truth.
How about a plane?
On his day off. Get the exact address.
Where'd he go yesterday?
I think I got something.
Well, I'm a working girl, Mr. Gittes. I didn't come in to see you on my own.
Oh no.
Yeah, Sophie.
Miss Ida Sessions again. She says you know her.
Would you mind if we took a stroll on our own?
J.J. Gittes. And it's not a departmental matter.
Oh yes. Hollis was the best department head the city's ever had. My goodness, what happened to your nose?
Only when you breathe... don't tell me you're still working for Mrs. Mulwray?
Wait. Please sit down, Mr. Gittes. We're... well, we're not anxious for this to get around, but we have been diverting a little water to irrigate avocado and walnut groves in the northwest valley. As you know, the farmers there have no legal right to our water, and since the drought we've had to cut them off. The city comes first, naturally.  But, well, we've been trying to help some of them out, keep them from going under. Naturally when you divert water you get a little runoff.
Sure you do.
I'm afraid so.
Mrs. Mulwray, do you love your husband?
Then go home and forget about it.
City of La Habra Heights filled an 800,000 gallon reservoir with sixteen inches of rain in two days.
Julian Cross worked for the water department?
Yes. No.
He owned the water department?
Yes.
Think you can nail Mulvihill? They'll claim you were trespassing.
Jake, it's Chinatown. They're all over the place. You oughta know better.
Oh? What do you do to make ends meet?
Alfredo, did you know my father?
Then why don't you want to teach it to me too? Now that there's no more cranking, and it's easier?
Because I'm an idiot. How many other guys in town know how to be a projectionist? None! Only a jerk like me could do it. Besides I wasn't lucky. When I was a kid there was the war! When I grew up, another war! Now it's all different. Times have changed. And you want to be a dope like me? Huh? Answer me!
But don't you like anything about what you do? 
I want to make you happy, Toto! I'm going to tell you a story.  Once upon a time a king gave a feast and there were all the most beautiful princesses of the realm. Basta, one of the guards, saw the king's daughter: she was the loveliest of all! And he immediately fell in love with her. But what could a poor soldier do compared with a king's daughter?!...One day he managed to meet her and told her he couldn't live without her. The princess was so struck by the depth of his feeling that she said to the soldier  'If you will wait a hundred days and a hundred nights beneath my balcony, then in the end I'll be yours.' Christ, the soldier ran off there and waited! One day, two days, ten, twenty...Every night she looked out of her window, but he never budged. Come rain, wind, snow, never budged! The birds shat on him and the bees ate him alive! After ninety nights he was gaunt and pale and tears streamed from his eyes but he couldn't hold them back. He didn't even have the strength to sleep any more. The princess kept watch...And on the ninety-ninth night, the soldier got up, picked up his chair and left!
But where'd you go, Toto?!!
You 're thinner...You can tell you've not been treated well. .
Do like the soldier, Toto! Go away! This land is cursed.  When you're here every day you feel like you're at the center of the universe, it seems like nothing ever changes. Then you go away, one year, two...And when you come back, everything's different. The thread has broken. You don't find those you were looking for, your things no longer exist. Isn't that the case?...You've got to go away a long time, for many, many years, before coming back and finding your people again, the land where you were born...But not now, it's impossible. Now you're blinder than I am. 
Good morning, father. It's hard on the feet, huh?
I don't care. I'll wait.
No, Mamma, it only takes an hour by air, you know.
"Miss Susan Alexander, a pretty but hopelessly incompetent amateur -  - last night opened the new Chicago Opera House in a performance of - of -"  I can't pronounce that name, Mr. Kane.
It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein.  I'm dictating it.
From the Chronicle Building that sign is the biggest thing you can see - every floor guaranteed - let's hope it bothers them - it cost us enough.
Ask them to sit down, Mr. Bernstein.
You and Leland and Mr. Kane - you were great friends back in the old days, I understand.
-  We thought maybe, if we can find out what he meant by that last word - as he was dying -
You know why?  She was so -
Who else did you see?
He made an awful lot of money.
The way things turned out, I don't need to tell you - Miss Emily Norton was no rosebud!
It didn't end very well, did it?
It ended -  Then there was Susie - that ended, too.  I guess he didn't make her very happy -  You know, I was thinking - that Rosebud you're trying to find out about -
Maybe that was something he lost. Mr. Kane was a man that lost - almost everything he had -  You ought to talk to Bradford Leland. He could tell you a lot.  I wish I could tell you where Leland is, but I don't know myself.  He may be out of town somewhere - he may be dead.
I'm not guaranteeing a thing, Mr. Bernstein.  You people work too fast for me!  Talk about new brooms!
Do you, Mr. Leland?
Do you, Mr. Leland?
Mr. Leland, why didn't you go to Europe with him?  He wanted you to.  He said to me just yesterday -
Mr. Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt? Am I a horse-faced hypocrite?  Am I a New England school-marm?
Well, he'll be coming back in September. The Majestic.  I got the reservations. It gets in on the ninth.
Go and get yourself washed up, Mr. Bernstein.  There doesn't seem to be an serious injury.
Thank you, Mr Carter.  This is Mr. Leland.
How do you do, Mr. Leland?
Mr. Carter, this is Mr. Bernstein. Mr. Bernstein is my general manager.
I'm going to live right here.  As long as I have to.
Yes - Mr. Kane.
How do you do?  I came here - and I made Mr. Kane come with me...  because I recieved this note -
Hello, Brad -
Emily, you're being - a little unfair -  You know what I think of Charles' behavior - about your personal lives -
There aren't any personal lives for people like us.  He made that very clear to me nine years ago - If I'd thought of my life with Charles as a personal life, I'd have left him then -
What do you expect me to do?  What in the world -
Here I am, darling...  Darling!... Darling, it's all right...  Mother's here.
What's this all about, Emily?  I've had a very tiring day and -
I insist on being told exactly what you have in mind.
There's only one person in the world to decide what I'm going to do - and that's me.  And if you think - if any of you think -
You're no Venus de Milo.
As a matter of fact, I do sing a little.
I mean in New York.
At night?
You may be right -  I sometimes wonder - but you get into the habit -
As far as you're concerned, Susan, I've never wanted anything -  I don't want anything now - except what you want.
Susan, I really think -
Oh, I don't mean the things you've given me - that don't mean anything to you.  What's the difference between giving me a bracelet or giving somebody else a hundred thousand dollars for a statue you're going to keep crated up and never look at?  It's only money.  It doesn't mean anything. You're not really giving anything that belongs to you, that you care about.
You do anything you want to do. The people of this state can decide which one of us to trust.  If you want to know, they've already decided. The election Tuesday'll be only -
You're making a bigger fool of yourself than I thought you would, Mr. Kane.  You're licked.  Why don't you -
"Enemy Armada Off Jersey Coast."  You know you haven't the slightest proof that this - this armada - is off the Jersey Coast.
Charles, my time is too valuable for me -
Can't say, sir.
Because the crackpot who did it had a copy of the "Enquirer" in his pocket?
They're true!  Everything I said! Witholding that veto was treason!
First of all, I will not write a good review of a play because somebody paid a thousand dollars for an advertisement in the "Enquirer."
Are you finished?
Maybe you could remember something that -
What's this?
David, Grobleski & Davis -  My dear Rawlston - 
Rawlston is my boss.
He knows the first Mrs. Kane socially -  That's the answer we got.
Well, that's about all there is - and I'm getting chills.  Hey, nurse!  Five years ago, he wrote from that place of his down South -  - you know.  Shangri-la?  El Dorado?  Sloppy Joe's?  What's the name of that place?  You know...  All right. Xanadu.  I knew what it was all the time.  You caught on, didn't you?
Yes.
I guess maybe I'm not as hard to see through as I think.  Anyway, I never even answered his letter. Maybe I should have.  I guess he was pretty lonely down there those last years.  He hadn't finished it when she left him - he never finished it - he never finished anything.  Of course, he built it for her -
Sure.
I want you to stop all this nonsense, Jim.
I know, but -
Queer?
Well, thanks a lot.
I didn't get a thing.  Just the music lessons.  That's all there was to it.
Don't you think I do?  You say you're going down to Xanadu?
Right away.  Will you have something, Mr. Thompson?
You're shittin' me.
Fifty-five.
You can hold me down.
A woman's intuition. Something in me says it's time to give the old boy a serious try.
Hey Caitlin...  Break his heart again this time, and I'll kill you. Nothing personal.
You're very protective of him, Randal. You always have been.
You're just going to lock the store like that?
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
The last thing I needed was for you to think I was hiding something from you.
It's just the shock of seeing me after three years. Believe me, you'll get over it.
Cute. Tell me you wouldn't want to go out again. After all the talking we've been doing.
What about Sing?
You're such an asshole.
We didn't just have sex in the bathroom?
What time was this?
I thought you just said you played hockey and went to a funeral.
Using filthy language in front of the customers... you should both get fired.
Dante, let me grab a Gatorade.
Someone jammed gum in the locks.
He assured me that he'd be here by twelve.
Why?
I'll bet the most frequent topic of arguments is Caitlin Bree.
Your mother.
Me pulling a can off some moron's fist.
All right, Vader's boss...
It would stand to reason, yes.
Hence, the Empire was a fascist theocracy, and the rebel forces were therefore battling religious persecution.
And the second one was still being built when they blew it up.
What's he looking for?
He said he has to find a perfect dozen.
What's a jizz-mopper?
Nudie booth?
What kind of show?
Think of the weirdest, craziest shit you'd like to see chicks do.  These chicks do it all. They insert things into any opening in their body... any opening.  He's led a very sheltered life.
I'm gonna hear it tomorrow.
What for? They don't bother me if I don't bother them.
You know who I can do without? I could do without the people in the video store.
Which ones?
So, what-you're stuck here all day?
I know.
Would you shut the hell up with that shit? It's not helping.
Paulsen's Funeral Parlor. The next show is at four.
Wait, wait, wait. Has it occurred to you that I might bereaved as well?
She meant nothing to you either until I told you she died.
I'm not taking you to this funeral.
That's embarrassing?
You knocked the fucking casket over, for Chrissakes!
Does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose?
So your argument is that title dictates behavior?
What the fuck did you do that for?
Two reasons: one, I hate when the people can't shut up about the stupid tabloid headlines.
I don't; you did.
Now I know you're lying.
You're kidding.
I should shit or get off the pot.
Leave me alone.
You're comfortable. This is a life of convenience for you, and any attempt to change it would shatter the pathetic microcosm you've fashioned for yourself.
Thank you. Why don't you go back to the video store?
Leave her out of this.
You were saying how you couldn't initiate change yourself, so I figured I'd help you out.
No thanks. I'll take care of it. We've got a lot of shit to talk about.
Do I know you?
You're Alyssa's sister? Heather?
I still remember Caitlin telling us about that time you two went to that motel-the one with the mirrors and the hot tub in the room.
Pretty girl, about this girl's height- dark hair-gorgeous body?
Oh man! Hey, you still going out with her?
What?
Yeah, you cock-smoking clerk.
I don't know. I wasn't watching.
Knock it off. That used to be my girlfriend.
I jacked the car up. All she did was loosen the nuts and put the tire on.
Damn. She sure goes out of her way.
You calling me a liar?
If you'll just tell me the title of your rental choice, I'll have him hold it for you.
I said go ahead.
The porno mags?
I'm only here until twelve, then I'm gone. The boss is coming in.
Who's fighting? Why are you so defensive?
You show some bedroom proficiency, and you think you're gods. What about what we do for you?
"Be there?"
Oh, you think so?
You're a pig.
Vegetable meaning paraplegic.
All right. Name it.
Oh my God-I feel so nauseous...
Please calm down.
Let it go...
HOW MANY?
Lower your voice!
I love you. Don't feel sick.
I'm going to school. Maybe later you'll be a bit more rational.
You had to tell him.
I had to tell someone. He put it into perspective.
What did he say?
...it isn't there. Yes.
Thank you for being rational.
What time do you get finished?
Eight. But I have a sorority meeting till nine, so I'll be back before you close. Can we go out and get some coffee?
I'm not the one trying to patch things up with my ex, sneaking around behind your back! And if you think that thirty-seven dicks are a lot, then just wait, mister: I'm going to put the hookers in Times Square to shame with all the guys I go down on now!
Explain what? How you were waiting until the time was right, and then you were going to dump me for her?
You open?
Yes.  I'm not out of shape.
I'm not out of shape!
What are you talking about?
Oh shit, look who it is. The human vacuum.
Come on, man, "Berserker!"
My ex-boyfriend was about his height, but he was much bulkier. He could bench two-fifty, three hundred easy.
No way!
Your ruse. Your cunning attempt to trick me.
Don't hold it against him. He just never got Caitlin out of his system. It's not your fault. It's Dante.  I don't know thing one about chicks. Do you want to cry or something? I can leave.
He didn't ask me to...
Um, do you think you can give me a lift home tonight?
No, I transferred into Monmouth this year. I was tired of missing him. 
"It's a perfect day for a monster jump."  Hey man, can you like do me a favor?
That woulda been cool.
If I don't meet up with them, you can come and pick me up by nightfall.
The money!
Remember, keep your arms and legs within the vehicle at all times--
I'm here for the same reason you are, so let's do it.
Look, I know--
Room service...Hi, Sarah.
Sarah, tonight why don't you and Hal come over for dinner?
Please -- oh, no -- please!
Help me!  I don't want to die!
That's a virtue isn't it?
The ledge, I know it well, or should I say <u>we</u> know it well.
Had to leave?  Believe me, we all wanted to leave...but you know what?  We stayed.
I know...
I was there, you were the only one who didn't panic.  So do everyone a favor, don't hog all the guilt.  You held on as long as you could.  Yes, everything did go wrong, starting with Hal. I mean, what was he doing up on the Tower with a girl who could barely climb?
Why are you yelling?
Why are you yelling?
Did I miss something?
Course maybe you don't have to wait until I faint.
You got to go back now!
What about you?
You attacked me.
Start pulling it apart!  We're climbing down on it.
Never
If we go along the northern ridge, we can get there first.
What do you think?  Maybe I could reach the ledge without falling. No, forget it.
We don't have time to argue about it!
An' if I miss, dig in and try your best to slow the fall.
The "old mouth to mouth" resuscitation routine.
Look here, the mountain man. You're Walker, right?
What's he doing?
No, the goddamn game's not over! It's never over when you're playing against a team that doesn't care if they win or lose-- how do you negotiate with someone like that?!
Yeah...
You're looking at him.
Who the hell ever is.  This is the most protected shipment we've got-- and the most useless. These bills aren't even <u>in</u> circulation; the one thousand dollar bills we're transporting are only used for international banking exchange.
Calm down...give the gun to me. You're out of control, son.
Kill me?  Christ we're partners in this!
I don't trust him.
Man against nature, right Travers.
Jessie?  Looks like your friend found company.
Richard Travers.
Appreciate it.
Mostly.  Armored cars can be hijacked.  Trains can be derailed.  But nobody can get to us in flight.
It was very kind of you to leave this out for me, sir. There was no-one around when I finished my bath, so I started. I hope that's alright, sir.
I'm so pleased you appreciate good wine. Have another glass!
... used to do everything for me and leave me to my writing.
I'm sorry to hear about that, sir. His face contorted in rage.
Excuse me, missus, can you please help? There's been a terrible accident. Can I please use your telephone for an ambulance?
What the bloody hell d'you think you're doing?
Feel like talking to us. Answering a few questions?
What would you like to know, sir?
Alex.
A rather intolerable pain in the head, brother, sir. I think it should be clear by this afterlunch.
Cut out all this clever talk about milicents. Just because the Police haven't picked you up lately doesn't, as you very well know, mean that you've not been up to some nastiness. There was a bit of a nastiness last night, yes. Some very extreme nastiness, yes. A few of a certain Billyboy's friends were ambluenced off late last night, yes. Your name was mentioned, the word's got thru to me by the usual channels. Certain friends of yours were named also. Oh, nobody can prove anything about anybody as usual, but I'm warning you, little Alex, being a good friend to you as always, the one man in this sore and sick community who wants to save you from yourself. Deltoid makes a grab for Alex's joint but finds his hand instead. Alex laughs. Derisively and rises. Deltoid distractedly reaches for a glass of water on the night table, and fails to notice a set of false teeth soaking in them. He drinks from the glass. The clink of the teeth sounding like ice-cubes.
Well, er, I think that was something that they hadn't planned for, you see, Missus, I'm very fond of music and always have been, especially Beethoven, Ludwig van... Beethoven. B... E... E... He leans over and looks at her writing in notebook.
So now you have the same reaction to music as you do to sex and violence?
You mean Beethoven's 9th Symphony?
We got worried. There we were waiting and drinking away at the old knify Moloko and you had not turned up and we thought you might have been like offended by something or other, so around we come to your abode.
Thank you very much for this chance, sir.
Helping you, sir?
Well, who can blame them, sir?
One I think you will like... as a, how shall I put it, as a symbol of our new understanding. An understanding between two friends.
Hullo lad. What a surprise, good to see you.
Oh fine, fi. Keeping out of trouble, you know.
Aye.
What about Basil? Where's my snake?
Oh well, he met with like an accident. He passed away. Alex becomes a bit weepy.
Oh, he had a shower this morning. You trying to call me a liar?
No, brother. What d'you want?
Why did you do that, brother? I've never done wrong to you.
Do you mean Church of England?
Yes, sir, Church of England, sir.
Crabs?
You're absolutely right, sir.
Vitamins will it be then?
Well, that was a very promising start. By my calculations, you should be starting to feel alright again. Yes? Dr. Brodsky's pleased with you. Now tomorrow there'll be two sessions, of course, morning and afternoon.
Just part of hospital routine.
No... I'm going to show you some slides and you are going to tell me what you think about them Alright?
Well, when I was all like ashamed up and half awake and unconscious like, I kept having this dream like all these doctors were playing around with me gulliver. You know... like the inside of me brain. I seemed to have this dream over and over again. D'you think it means anything?
Oh, thankyou, your honour. The Tramp takes a second look at Alex.
And, Father, I've never been guilty of any institutional infractions, have I?
You certainly have not, 655321. You've been very helpful, and you've shown a genuine desire to reform.
Where did you hear about this? Whose been talking about these things?
One shirt - blue, collar attached.
Sir, 655321, sir.
Shut your filthy hole, you scum!!!
I agree, sir. What we need are larger prisons. More money.
What?
It's no big deal.
You never answered my question.  You like what you do?
You still carrying passengers?
You dizzy?  You want to sit down?
You heard Armstrong play live.  I've never been this jealous.  You get to talk to him?
Remember what you played?
I know the answer.  I know all there is to know about Louis.
I'm sorry.
What?
I picked up a tail.
As a token of my appreciation for your understanding in this matter, I'd like to offer you a discount for my services tonight.  Twenty five percent.
...got off the phone with his dispatcher.  What an asshole. Cabbie's name is Max Rilke, been driving that cab for ten years...
Lemme tell you something.  Vincent and a few other guys like him are fucking ghosts.  Nobody even know what he looked like until now...
...this snitch of yours, what's his name, Ivan?
You guys been holding hands?
Not our call, Phil.
Tell my son.  You have to hold a gun to his head to get him to come see me.
I got caught up at work.
Oh.  Oh, thank God, hey!  Hey, guys, hey, help me out here!
How am I supposed to not get excited, listening to you trying to extort your employee, you sarcastic prick?
Jesus, what is with this guy?
What are you guys, taking an all-night tour?
Yeah?  So?
You share it with over three million people every day.  You know that's the population of New Zealand?  What's Manhattan, thirteen miles long? That's a lot of misery crammed into thirteen miles.  Read about this one guy.  Gets on the subway and dies.  Six hours he's riding around before anybody notices. Think about that.  Here's this corpse doing laps around Manhattan courtesy of the New York transit system, people getting on and off, sitting next to him, and still nobody catches on. Three million.  That's too damn many people.
You know, this is the cleanest cab I've ever been in.  This your regular ride?
Regulations?  These guys don't even give you sick leave.  How much you pull down on a good night?
We have a deal.  What's your name?
He fell on my cab!  From up th-th-there.
I'm gonna roll him off the hood. Always lift with your legs...
What?
Max.  May we leave the scene of the crime now, please.
You listening to me?
Yes!  I'm trying, I swear!
What?
I didn't throw him, he fell.
Then don't let me get cornered, Max. You don't have the trunk space.
Hands on the wheel.  Ten and two o'clock, like they taught you in driver's ed.
What?
Max?  What are you doing?
Hey, I'm not the one who's been lying to my mother.
It's cause they don't like their lives, so they project their patterns of negative behavior onto you...  I had a father like that.
What do <u>you</u> call it?  Ten years doesn't sound temporary to me.  I should have known it was bullshit, you're too good at what you do.
Well, this big stake's got to be big by now.  When you leaving?
See, I've got bills.  My mother's been dying of the same disease since I was a kid.
Vincent.  Don't make me do this. Don't make me get people killed.
Fifteen years, although I prefer the term "assassin."
Washington and Holt.  Dance club called "Fever." Know it?
You had to kill Heller?!
That's the reason?
Man, if someone had a gun to your head and said:  "You gotta tell me what's goin' on with that person over there or I'll kill you"...they'd have to kill you...  'Cause you don't have a clue for...or about...anyone...  To be like that, I don't think you, you have any of that for your own life...  Do you believe you're entitled or at least expect to draw breath in the a.m.?  Open your eyes in the morning?  I don't think you do...I don't think so...  I think you are way <u>low</u>...like in your estimation.  In your estimation of yourself.  So how'd you get that way...?
Look in the mirror.  ...piss-ant paper towels...a bottle of 409...saving up for goin' to the Comoros.  How much you got saved?
Max?
That's love.
Love gives you wings.  It makes you fly.  I don't even call it love.  I call it Geronimo.
She must be some girl.
I never told her.
I was only going one way.
You think I'm crazy.
You bit someone's nose off?
You switched the charts; you tell me.
I got to get downstairs.  The C.I.A., they want to see your body.
If you're worried about the President, call and warn him about the Space Shuttle.
Uh uh, don't want <u>them</u> to see me.
More about life on Mars.  From a rock they <u>found</u> on the South Pole. Explain that one to me.  But maybe we should go to Mars and find out? How much do you think that's going to cost?
You're certifiable.
Equitation.
Please put it down.
Did you see the van back there?
What van?
I'll be fine.  Let's worry about Henry Finch.  P.O. Box in St. Louis.  He's the last on the list. I haven't been able to reach him yet.
Answer me.  Was the first time you saw me the first time I saw you? Was it?  You've been following me around.  Do you see how that could be disconcerting to me?  That's not love, Jerry.  It's obsession. And it isn't normal and you can't expect me to respond to it and you can't expect me to feel the same way.  Can you?
I don't.  I know you wouldn't.
What is it?
John Hinkley.  The guy who shot Reagan.  He only had two names.
How'd you get the picture?
Blue moon... Blue moon...
How did you know?
Geronimo is down.
I love you, too.
You're here because you figured I might show up.
It seemed like a possibility. What about your intentions?  Are they honorable?
Ask what you can do for your country.  That kind of thing.
M.K. ULTRA was terminated in 1973. But not the research. It was renamed.  EX CATCHER.
If I had any idea what to charge you with or how to prove it, I'd arrest you right here.
Go ahead, Miss Sutton.
Tell him I'm on vacation.  That I won't be back for two weeks.
He's why I watch Jerry.  Jerry's the bait for Jonas.
Is it possible...?
I'm willing to take that risk.
No doubt.
Goddamnit, they are out there, David --
David --
If it's attention you want I'd say you've got it.  Just one thing:  Why Vega? Everyone's looked at Vega for years with no results, and now, yesterday, they start broadcasting primes. Why?
Ellie.
What?
Ellie... we both know that if I was any kind of a man, I never would've entered this race.  That I would have told the President straight out:  Helen, Eleanor Arroway is naive and strident and an enormous pain in the ass... but she's got more courage and intelligence than the rest of us put together.  That more then anyone else on the planet, she's earned this.  And that she should be the one to go because she's the best we have.  But that's not who I am.  I like to think it's who I might've been if things had gone a different way; that I might have been worthy, really worthy of what I've been given...  You do what you have to do.  And in the end, as with everything, it comes down to power.  And it isn't fair...
Because you cut it from the budget three years running.
What...
How can that be?
J39 Z186...?
Okay, let's just slow down.  Pull up the starfield signal origin.
I think we just hit the cosmic jackpot.
-- which we'll also need the network's help to receive and decode!
Colonel Jarrod, I'd like a twenty mile radio-silent perimeter put around this installation immediately.
If at some later date the message proves harmless, we can discuss sharing it with the rest of the world, but until then --
Is that your official response?
Please answer the question, Doctor.
So.  Are you an hallucination?  Or are little gear trains and circuit boards under your skin?
You contacted us.  We were simply listening.  We've been listening for millions of years.
Many others.
... all those voices... you gather them all together.  Millions of intelligences in one consciousness... and now we're a part of it.
But -- other people from our planet should see what I've seen -- they should witness this for themselves.
But you said you wanted to help -- don't you see what it would mean?
It's time to go home now.
The powers that be have been quite busy lately, falling over each other to position themselves for the game of the century, if not the millennium.  Perhaps you've noticed.  Perhaps I could help deal you back in.
A sunrise and a sunset every forty- five minutes.
You sound like Joseph.  You think the world ends with the millennium?
As each component was tested and shipped off to Texas a duplicate was maintained and assembled in Hokkaido -- for backup purposes, of course. We've been right behind you the entire time.  You see my problem:  I couldn't appear to control too large a percentage; my enemies wouldn't stand for it.  So I simply made sure the Japanese consortium received the systems integration contract.  Of course no one had to know the corporations involved were recently acquired, wholly-owned subsidiaries --
... Drumlin said you're been down at Arecibo for the last year.
'The work,' Jesus, Ellie, can't there just once be more to life than the work?  Okay, maybe that's the only way to get the recognition, win the prizes --
It's all right, the important thing is you're safe --
Peter, what are you talking about? What malfunction?  What day is this?
Well it's been a while, but I don't recall the Bible saying too much about alien civilizations.
Only a tiny bit.  Even the most devout believer is allowed a little doubt.
Yes.  Very much.
Some of my best friends are scientists.  They're saying the machine is alive.
If you came back.  If you survived at all.  Which it's pretty certain you wouldn't.
Really.
And yet you're willing to die for this cause, the one thing that's given your life a sense of purpose. Don't you see the contradiction here -- ?
The final countdown.
During the crusades -- pilgrims who made the journey to the holy land brought back a palm frond to show they'd actually been there.  I thought it sort of made sense that Earth is now your holy land, so...
You're trembling.
What...?
I can't do this --
I'm in love with you, Ellie.
I can't hear this now --
So.  I'm assuming they sent you here to administer last rites?
They don't believe me.
Have you seen what's happening out there?  The terror, the despair? The world is on fire, Ellie.  People need something they can believe in, something worthy, and you can give it to them!
It's designed purely as a defensive device.  Call it a reasonable precaution.
Call it xenophobic paranoia.  Don't you see the absolute absurdity of this?  This isn't about them, it's about us -- our violence, our fear and mistrust --
Well.  That would seem to decide it. Like it or not, for the moment, anyway, it looks like we're all in this together.
Boss, I made an arrangement with that man to take his broom.
Yeah, well, Arletta, you done your best. What I done with myself is my problem.
You never thought that's a heavy load?
Nothin'. Ever'thing's cool's can be.
Nothin' to do with it. I ain't never give John the kind of feelin' I give you, so I'm payin' him off now. Don't feel you got to say anything. Way it is, sometimes, you just have a feelin' for a child or you don't, and with John I just didn't.
A salesman! Cool Hand Luke a salesman?
Hey, Tattoo!
But there's still daylight left.
Looka that! Two of them. Oh my...
Somebody say somethin'?
Well, whatta we got here?
Whatta you so happy about?
I'm gonna kill you, you go on...
Hey, buddy. Take it easy. You're making me look bad.
Where'd the road go?
We ain't goin' nowhere.
One rule! No throwing up. He throws up, you forfeit everything.
What's the writing say?
Man, it's so hot.
Ana paira ninas. Koko's the brains.
I'm in.
Picture's a phoney... Cost me a week's pay.
You think you've been working hard. This muther'll break your back.
But earlier, he was staring up here.  <u>Please</u>, Andy.
Oh, God.  I must have looked horrible.
What?  What'd I do?
When are you going to call them?
Oh, God, I forget.  Yes.  Yes.  You go.  Poor thing, you ought to get out.
Investigators Halloran and Goetz.  I apologize for Goetz, he's a firehouse dog.
I never hurt nobody...
You already made the delivery?
I brought a present for the lady, there.  I'm looking for her, to give her the present...
Kurten!  Is he bothering you?  I told that son I'd send him what he wanted if he leave you alone.
I don't know.  I'd like to know where he is.
Listen, you want my advice?  Steer clear.  He's writing me he's gonna finish 'my unfinished symphony.' He's gonna give me $550 for some of my cum, he says he's in a position to see that I will be immortal if he has some of my spunk.  I'm offended.  Right away I smell <u>freak</u>.  Writin' about him and me and <u>you</u> bein' joined and he's gonna finish my <u>symphony</u>?  I didn't care for his drift.  I sent some liquid soap in a sandwich baggie with a message from Jesus to mend his ways.  You hear I found Jesus?  And what's funny is, now I don't mind bein' inside.  If I was out, even Born Again, I'd probably get restless again.  It's maybe better I stay here, what do you think?
You know I can't do that.
It was a lover or a husband. Someone close.  Somebody who knew her and cared about her.
She probably let him in the door without a thought.  Where are their mothers?!  Where are the mothers that are supposed to teach them to be wary and to tough and not afraid to fight?
Nobody knows you have anything to do with this case; nothing has been on TV or the news... Why would he want to get in <u>your</u> computer?
That's amazing.  A whole new book, thought up in a minute.  Very good.  All I know how t do is get up, take a shower, and go to work. Hope, if he does another I'll nail the son of bitch, and they'll spell my name right in the newspaper. Where is Andy going?
It's what Bianchi and Buono injected into one of their victims.
Who's going to catch him?  You?  And if you do, there'll be another one.  And one after that.
You betrayed me!  Now every psychopath in the city knows I'm back in business... You lied to me!
He felt sorry for me.  It was so nice to flirt.  He was a darling man.
If there's a one percent possibil- ity, can you live with yourself when he kills again?
You and MaryJane aren't lovers.
You take it, hang on to it, it'll make you feel safer.  Stay put.
How come you're so up on Dr. Hudson?
You touch anything, Mike?  Pick up anything?  Use the doorknob?  I don't want to find your prints on anything later and you tell me you forgot to tell me.
Because it's your job, that's all.
You're good enough you'll never have to kill anyone.  I joined the cops to save lives, not waste them.
Snotty neurotic bitch...
Classy madonna.
Look at her legs.
The woman was in shock.  She was totally out on ranks.  I stayed because I didn't want her to wake up alone in a place where she'd just been under attack.  Stop that, you son of a bitch!  The place wasn't secure.  I was doing my goddamn job!  And, for the <u>second time</u>, I slept in her living room.
Right.
Who've I got to beat up except the messenger?  Does this give us anything to go on?
I'm checking out anybody who lives like DeSalvo.  Records of arrests for rape, especially by a man wearing green.  Checking out psychiatric hospitals for his personality profile.  Cross check- ing names from arrests for sexual offenses, public fondling.  If they've got a German wife.  We can keep cops working on this kind of junk for years, and this guy's going to hit again, soon.
You got a suspect...
I'm gonna drop charges on the break-and-enter at Hudson's...
I just got here myself, Susan.
She left you, Nikko.  She's not your responsibility.  She takes very good care of herself.  If she wants to romance the kid, it ain't your business.  Your business is to snap out of it.
Why don't we save it for later? It's almost time for Letterman.
She lies all the time.  Why would I say I fed her if I didn't?
The other man, the dead man, his wife is a doctor - Dr. Helen Remington. She's here, somewhere. As a patient, of course. Maybe you'll find her in the hallways tomorrow on your walk.
What about his wife? The woman doctor? Have you visited her yet?
I can't sit on this balcony forever. I'm beginning to feel like a potted plant.
Is the traffic heavier now? There seem to be three times as many cars as there were before the accident.
Would you like to tuck him, though? In that car?
Have you seen his penis?
The traffic... where is everyone? They've all gone away.
I think he'll be waiting for us at the airport
It's not here. Maybe the police are still holding it. Their forensic people...
So - why the airport?
Oh yes. I thought he was a medical photographer, doing some sort of accident research. He wanted every conceivable detail about our crash.
Is this part of the act or are they really hurt?
Can you drive?
Hard to say.
It's very... satisfying. I'm not sure I understand why.
Do we have to talk about this?
Look, I know he's almost through with treatment here. And, he's on medication.
I thought about calling, but I want to wait until I know when I'll be out.
I think it's about that time, Letty. The charges against you have been dropped, the drugs have evened out and you seem to be dealing with your life quite well.
How?
Maybe, though. Maybe it would work. I could throw you an engagement party maybe.
And the party?
Fuck me.
Sage, rosemary...  Les Herbes.
Letty, dinner's almost ready.   The souffle...
You're slowing.
Paul could pop the question at any time.
Maybe I should talk about this with Ruth, or Paul.
We aren't allowed to wear jewelry in here, Mom.
I hear this Michael fellow is schizophrenic.
I'm so thankful you'll be leaving next week. If you want me to pick you up, I will.
I'm going to take that as an honest effort at being open minded.
It had this red spot on its back.
Green spot.
If you feel lonely, or need to talk, all you have to do is say so.
I don't mean to go on and on like this.
What if it's got a pattern?
You have no right, no right to take the worst thing that's ever happened to me and make it into some kind of game.
What are you looking to read?
Was it bad news--the visit from Peter?
For a price.
We're supposed to be asleep.
Tell the doctor.
Do you?
I do.
Tell me all.
Just checking.
I saw Paul leaving.    Did you do the dirty deed?
So, it's over?
No, I need some serious household advice.
First off, you'll need to go to Target. And, let's see, what should you buy?
Aren't you supposed to throw a bouquet or something?
Throw pillows, Letty. The sales lady said they're the latest thing.
Just promise you'll love me even if I end up in a job where I have to wear a blue polyester cap.
No, that's Aunt Connie. Lily is the one who looks like a hooker.
Oh. And, Harry, he's the one who likes magic?
I sure know what that feels like.
Like I've told you before I don't want you taking care of me.
I love you so much.
Don't you have a magic trick or something to make this easier?
It's not another one. It's my sister.  Aren't you happy for her?
In there's better.  It's kind of romantic, don't you think?
I'm sorry.  I'm just...I'm so tired lately.
Of course it will. Remember the big talent show you planned last year? And what about the Christmas benefit when Santa canceled at the last minute? But you still pulled it off.
Of course not, no.  Is that why you're here?
No.
What's so urgent?   You've got me worried.
Of all the crazy things. I understood when you dropped out of law school. And during this whole mess, I've tried to be supportive. But, really, Letty, what can you be thinking?
It's a very nice letter. But I have to go with what's best for the students.
Agent Hadley.
A pass.
Witness' can be convinced they made a mistake. Without the murder weapon the D.A. won't have enough to prosecute you.
What the fuck was all that about at the hotel last night? I thought we had a deal?
You want the tapes for yourself.     You're going to sell them.
They're supposed to be evidence.    That's why Bastaldi set this up.
Too many people know about my involvement in this.
Hey man, you can't do that!
No.
Thank you Marcel, for that... extremely redundant explanation.
Don't bullshit me, Laurant!   I know about the Van Gogh.
I don't have it. That's why Vincent went to Chicago. They arrested him before he could bring it back.
You sure? I just got a shipment of espresso from Sicily. Special blend. Can't find anything like it in the States.
-- Super what?
Then why not just fuckin' say better than expected? Everybody knows what better than expected means.
Yeah. Seems Maranzano wants to talk about buying the Merchant Street warehouse.
Uh, no --
No one has mentioned the part of the plan about us getting caught and going to prison.
Hopefully no one.
I'm going to kill him myself!
Turn on the flashlight.
Do they come with batteries?
You call being Bastaldi's lap dog better?
We all agreed to it. You had no way of knowing Bastaldi was setting us up.
Anybody hungry?
No, that would have left me with nothing because all of you would be dead.
I will.
I'll be right back. He gets out of the car and walks over to him.
What do you want now?
I ain't bullshittin'. I can get guns. I can get any kind of gun you want. But they ain't gonna help your sorry ass. You ain't been in town one day and already you got two of the toughest people in Chicago looking for you. How is that possible?
-- you stole my cousin Enrique's car.
He told Enrique he didn't know anything about his car.
If I knew where they were you wouldn't have to find them, would you?
You didn't say find them. You said, "get them."
Just find them!
Good song though.
What'd you guys find?
Yeah. I'll come down and make a full confession later. Right now, tell me what else you found?
There's an exterior alarm system. There's also another one in the hall that leads to the bedroom with a motion detector. The control panel is in the bedroom.
What is it you do, Sami?
I knew this was a mistake! I knew it last night when you asked me to go along with this. I could hear that little voice in my head saying, "don't do it! Don't you do it!" Jesus, why don't I ever listen to myself?
I'll drive.
I knew I should have driven.
No.   How much?
You guys used to work together?
Fine. All of you want to be angry? Be angry... but I'm the one who took the ball and that makes it mine.
Yeah.   It's mine.
The hell it is.
Fuck you, grease-ball!
I said knock it off! Now as far as I'm concerned you two girls can bitch slap yourselves silly when this is over, but right now we've got to figure out what's going on.
Algeria.
I can't even hear myself think.
What does arresting us get them?
You ever hear of jet lag?
Did she break your heart?
It looks old.     Did you get it a long time ago?
You got it in a bar?
You broke my arm. How the hell do you think I'm doin'?
A little?
It's for you.
Okay.    Okay.
Why should I?  You need practice. I can teach you to fight with the Green Destiny, but first you must learn to hold it in stillness.
I owe you nothing.
I've made you silk pajamas.  Do you want to change into them?
But I have had much practice.  As a child in the West, a platoon lived with us.  They'd let me play with their weapons.  The scabbard is so beautiful.
Exquisite!  You said it belongs to...
Sure.  No place to bathe for days, sleeping in flea-infested beds... They tell you all about that in those books?
You're not married, are you?
No!  You couldn't roam around freely if you were.
You write gracefully.  Calligraphy is so similar to fencing.
Do you think so?  Let me tell you a story.
I am not an aristocrat, as you are... but I must still respect a woman's duties.
Go back to them first.  Then you can decide about Lo.
Li Mu Bai has made arrangements. He sent him to Wudan Mountain.
Give it back!
You've got quite a temper.  It's better this way.
It's mine.  It means a lot to me. A barbarian like you wouldn't understand.
Out here, you always fight for survival.  You have to be part of a gang to stand a chance.  Slowly, your gang becomes your family.  All that Dark Cloud stuff is just to scare people and make my life easier.
During my meditation training... I came to a place of deep silence... I was surrounded by light... Time and space disappeared.  I had come to a place my master had never told me about.
The Green Destiny Sword?  You're giving it to Sir Te?
Come with me to Peking.  You can give the sword to Sir Te yourself. It'll be just like old times.
But something is going on at the Yu household.
I don't know it was stolen until I got here.
My blood will soon reverse its flow. It's the same poison she used to kill my master.  There is no antidote.
But don't be too lenient.
Yes.  The very killer of Li Mu Bai's own master.  Last night, she killed a policeman who had tracked her down.
You've always been so good to Li Mu Bai and me.  Please accept our thanks.
Has Governor Yu ever seen the sword?
Sir Te, can you find some excuse to invite Madam Yu and her daughter?
This sack of shit is called Tin- Tin.
You buying?
No onions?
Don't thank me.  Your ass is already in enough trouble for this shit.
Fucking A, my friend.
I need you to tell me what you remember.  What happened to us?
Yeah, among others.  Hey, man -- you're hit.
You're welcome.
I was wonderin' where you'd gotten to --  Oh, Elly, honey, a cat.  Here?
At least it finally stopped raining.
Fun, he's not going away; he's scaring the piss outta me!
Mister Funboy.
Mister Funboy lives there?
I'm looking for a good guitar man.
Holy shit... you're dead, man...
How the hell did you do that?
Shelly?
Blow yourself, bigmouth.
What... the hell is that?
I'm Kathryn.
Have we met?
I don't think so.
You might say that.
Now I remember. Annette Harrison. Your father's the new headmaster at Oakwood.
Who the hell do you think you are coming into my house and saying those things to me. My brother is dead, have some respect.
I don't know. I've been hearing some awful things about him.
You a lesbo?
That's a first. Most people praised me for it.
Several times. I'm not as dumb as I act, you know. When Howard Roark makes love to Dominique Francon... most romantic scene in all of literature.
How's the water?
About what?
About what you said today in the stable. I'm not a happy person.
I'm sorry, but you're not my type.
No thank you.
It was fine.
I'm trying to better myself, but the one person who can help me is the same one pushing me away.
I'm sorry, but I'm not here to be your savior.
Don't you believe in love at first sight?
What?
I'm... I'm alright.
Okay.
It's weird. I actually feel good about myself. Can we do this again next week?
Oh please.
Who's Monsieur Philipe?
I thought you said we were going to be friends.
Good for you.
You don't know how to love.
- wrote a letter to this chick and saying shit about me.
I think he's telling the truth Valmont. Greg couldn't write a grocery list let alone a letter.
Oh, I suck. I suck.
Really? Bulimic headcase.
What a loser she must be.  Anyhow, Court's invited me to the Hamptons for Labor Day Weekend.
You think so? I don't know. I guess I'm just scared.
Are you for real?
What are you saying?
No.
I don't know.
Listen to me. Your mother must never know. Never.
Calm down. Tell me what's wrong.
Does your mother know?
I don't know.
So? Don't you want to make Ronald a happy pappy? Practice makes perfect, Cecile. My advice is to sleep with as many people as possible.
Cecile, all I want to do is give you a kiss.
And you haven't made an ounce of progress.
Why? I like spending time with you. You know, you're quite attractive for a woman your age. You have killer legs. Killer.
Yummy.
Alright honey, just calm down, take a deep breath, and step out of the circle.
What's wrong?
I think he's high on drugs. He hit me, then took off. I'm afraid to be alone. Please come over.
I don't find this very funny,
I need you to seduce our young Cecile. Introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery.
You don't stand a chance. Even this is out of your league.
I'll think about it...
Oh gee, your journal. Could you be more queer?
I'll give you something you've been jerking off about ever since our parents got married.
Be more specific.
You can put it anywhere.
Who are you calling?
Before we go through with this, I just want you to be aware of the damage we're going to cause.
What's your problem?
Some other time.
No, I'm not.
I've never done this before.
I'd love to, but unfortunately I'm expecting some company.
I think you have your answer.
Don't worry, it's totally understandable. Most of the boys that matriculate at Oakwood are very upstanding gentleman, however there are the occasional bad apples.
Got me off the streets? I live on 59th and Park.
It's desperate that I talk to her.
Do you know where she is?
Later. Listen, we're entertaining some guests so -
You're a lucky guy.
Ronald, you don't know what you're talking about.
Oliver's pet,  I'm sure it would be the first thing he'd grab if we ever had a fire.
That the old actress -- Julia Farren?
Does she go up to the Farren's often?
It's one of the clearest memories I have. Twelfth night...burning pine... and mummers' plays.
No dear. I don't know them, but I've heard about them.
Mommy, could Edward take me to Mrs. Farren's house to give her her present?
I'd hate her to grow up like that.
Ollie.
Where did you get it?
I thought you were with Amy.
Did you mail then?
Yes, I did.
Where did you mail them?
But wishes don't come true.
And who did the voice belong to?
Daddy!
Amy, answer me. Why did you call her your friend?
What'd you get for Christmas?
Of course. And Two is the prince who kneels before her on one knee.
There's an oak leaf.  Add a maple.
light shining) in her eyes) Throw sea weeds into the flames, and the fire turns blue!
Merry Christmas.
Look at my ring.
That's a fine-looking ring.
A ring that I can wish on like I wished on the candles?
But I want to talk to you. Mommy says for you to come up to the old house with me. I've got to take back this ring.
You just wait until I finish here. I've got to dust these ships for your Dad.
You're going to be busy all day long, Edward.
Little miss, don't you never come here alone. You gave me a fright, you did.
But I only came to give back the ring.
She's always spying on me. She creeps into the room. She lives upstairs, yet she's always watching me â€ always!
Hide me? Why?
Hurry, hurry.
Hurry!
Look at me. Look at me, mother darling. Look into my eyes. What color eyes did Barbara have?
But don't you see...it's just what I was about to say to Alice...Amy in her own mind may not be lying.
But we have. She's wanted for nothing.
I don't believe in PMS. Women made it up just so they can be bitchy.
James Dean, Humphrey Bogart...
I mean body temperature. Do you have a fever?
You haven't mentioned dating anyone since Mark and, well you're not a lesbian are you?
Sorry. It's just so bad lately. You're so lucky you never get PMS.
Okay, just one more stop and you'll be all set. Victoria's Secret.
I don't know.
Can you believe she fuckin' bit me?
I think she broke the skin.
What I really hated about dating was the lines guys used to get into my apartment. "Can I use your phone?" "How about a nightcap?" "I want to meet your cat." And my all-time favorite, the old standby, "I have to use your bathroom."
Holy shit, I'm a freak.
There you go, blaming yourself for everything again.
Frida, this hair thing is all in your head. You're using it as an excuse not to get close to anyone.
First of all, you're my alibi. I told George I was with you last night.
"Paranoia, insecurity, depression, changes in vision, feelings of losing control; belief that you have a mental problem..." Nothing about turning into a werewolf.
Did I kill a guy named Benito?
I do development for TV movies.
No. Really, I'm... I don't feel well. I've got terrible PMS.
It's a matter of life and death.
You think that story's gonna make me loan you money?
On your desk.
Script coverage?
How about a "Man in Jeopardy" story?
No. I quit. Take your lame ass ideas, your fake ass toupee, your fat ass wife and your ugly ass kids and shove them.
When's the last time you saw him?
That's my ex. He's an asshole. In case you couldn't tell. I think he's been following me.
I'm trying to stay away from caffeine.
Oh, it's nothing.
No, but thanks for the warning.
What's with the squirt guns?
Can't you bite me and then I'll be like you?
I'm going to take a shower.
Here's a towel.
A kiss? Did you have sex with him?
Seems you were the last to see Carlton alive. And the last to see Gregory alive.
Jesus Christ she got her period. Relax guys. It happens.
Why would you want to be a cop?
I told you she was innocent.
Hey, there was a lot of blood.
Maybe. What about all those hairs they found on his body?
Not really...
Really?  And how is his state of mind?
What about Thompson, sir?  WasnÃ­t this his case?
Yes, sir.  I'm sorry...  But I don't understand how it was possible.  The only window was twenty feet up a vertical wall, he was cuffed...
IÃ­m your new assistant.
Why, yes.
Shut up!
You're a liar!
Not that again...
It's a trick.
What is it?
Wave from the door... go down the stairs... get into the limo...
What?
I'm not certain about...
Dave...
I'm... not... nobody...
Look... at some point we're going to have to call the Vice President...
Till what?
Oh, I know. And then when our poor President gets another stroke - - of course much more serious this time - - the newly appointed V.P. becomes the Pres...
Duane's guys, but he's got them under control.
Fine.
Clean.
What are you gonna do?
What do you mean by that?
You sure?  A Coke or a Perrier or something?
Will he be alright?
Dave, the budget's a very complicated thing.  Even I don't understand it sometimes.  Now occasionally we have to make some cuts and...
Now he's making stuff up about me.
And it's proving quite effective...
Perceptual?
Yes, it's designed to bolster individual confidence in a previous domestic automotive purchase.
Well... to shore up product identification and preserve market share.
Something like what...
How'd you get started?
Really?
Who?
Well...
What?
I care about the homeless.
Look.  If there was some mistake...
You're leaving?
So what do you do the rest of the time?
I know.
I know. I'm sorry...
Hi.
I wish I had better news... Our compassion index is off seven points from the last sample and that's down eighteen on the year.  The `Cares About People Like Me' numbers are really in the toilet.  We're off twenty points from March and that was right after we raised interest rates...
We're all set,  sir.
I'll bargain with you. How many of you are on the island?
Two of us...only two of us...me...and him. 
I don't believe you, rebel. Where are your headquarters? On the mainland?
There are no...headquarters. There are no...rebels. Only the walking dead. Don't you see. They have won.
Now I think Captain's punishment is fair, considerin'. In fact I think you ain't got shit ta complain about.
How we gonna break the curse without a prayer or two.
Looks like just two. We can take 'em when the time comes.
I'm gonna have this stuff sent over to the hospital...
Julie Grant is a behaviouralist. She's not medical. She hasn't been as...exposed to...to things...as some of the rest of us. She'll be alright. I'll talk to her. She'll be alright.
That bastard. I didn't think he'd make his move so fast.
Rafts. Two 38s. A little ammo.
Well, I'd better find Patsy.  Say hello to Mutt for me.
Sounds boring to me.
At Chet Danburry's house.
What is the point?
Yaa, I'm a dead poet!
Don't you think they'll figure out who did it?!  Don't you know they'll come to you and demand to know what the Dead Poets Society is?   Charlie, you had no right to do something like that!
No!  Anybody else would have jumped my bones by now but you're after my soul. Make me up some more poetry.
Todd's brother is Jeffrey Anderson.
Sure.
Nuwanda, what is going on?
You what?!  How did you do that?
You still shouldn't have done it, Charlie.  You don't speak for the club.
What good will that do?
Oh, hi.  I'm glad you made it.  Did you bring anybody?
But, Chris...
If Chet sees you, he'll kill you, don't you know that?
And if it so happens that you're wrong? If it just so happens that I could care less About you?
Chet?  To a play? Are you kidding?
Just give me one chance.  If you don't like me after tonight, I'll stay away forever.
Uh-huh.
This was my first classroom, John, did you know that?  My first desk.
English.  Way before your time.  It was hard giving it up, I'll tell you.  I'm hearing rumors, John, of some unusual teaching methods in your classroom.  I'm not saying they have anything to do with the Dalton boy's outburst, but I don't think I have to warn you that boys his age are very impressionable.
YAWP!
A madman.
A crazy madman.
A... A  sweaty-toothed madman.
Okay.
Isn't there an easier way?
All right.  Jesus, what are you gonna do?
Don't you dare talk back to me!  It's bad enough that you've wasted your time with this absurd acting business.  But you deliberately deceived me!  Who put this in your head? How did you expect to get away with it? Answer me!
Did you really think I wouldn't find out?!  "My niece is in a play with your son," Mrs. Marks says.  "You must be mistaken," I say.  "My son isn't in a play."  You made a liar out of me, Neil! Now you will go tomorrow and tell them you are quitting.
I'll take him over mine.
Want to come to the study group?
But why?  Don't you understand what Keating is saying?  Don't you want to do something about it?
I don't want to read.
From you?
Chicken shit.  Where were we?
Right here...middle of nowhere...
Unless you collected on the insurance...
I was born in a City housing project in the Bronx OK? It's not in the cards that I die on a luxury cruise ship...now which way up?
Look lady, I know you people are used to getting your way...
Well, you sure do a good imitation.
Looking good...
Oh my god! Oh my god! How do we do it? How do we get there?
You want ME to go up there?
Three minutes...I'm not back...no matter what...you go...
Shut up! You hear me!!
If I told you once...I told you a thousand times...
Me??
Joey, you want to get sucked out by a giant fucking mutated squid?
Maybe it's the wrong ship.
Hey! What are you trying to pull!
She fucked me.
That's mustard!
Maxie! Hey Maxie wha'd'ya say!
You're full of shit, Vince! You're so full of shit you're going to float away!
You don't!
Then what's the gun for! What's this for?
I got delayed. I --
Angela, I just heard Sal was alive.
What hospital is he in? Where?
But of course! Please make yourself comfortable. Perhaps you would enjoy some fresh caviar, or une petite glace, or --?
You are his friend.
Where is he???
Linda, yeah.
No.
No?
Why?... What do you mean?... Why???
Fine. I'm fine. How are you?
Great. Fine... Once or twice it did fall off the blocks. I don't know what that's from.
Yeah... All the guys, we're all going huntin'. Like we did. You know? Like we always used to.
I'm just so lonely.
C'mon. I've got the car.
I... No. You do this for money?
Ah yes. Of course... So few survive.  La creme de la creme... How did you obtain release?
Won't we? Right? Am I right?
You should have put that on last night.
You're a fucking nut. You know that, Merle? You're a fucking maniac!
What'd he say?
When you get the AK, open up. You got me? Open up.
Nick!... I thought you went home.
Here, here! This is it!
No!!!?
Some fuckin' friend... You're some fuckin' friend, Merle!
This is this, Vince. This isn't something else. This is this!
Nick. Hey. How's things?
Yeah.
I saw him last night. I thought I was dreaming. I thought I was out of my mind.
Oh cards, maybe. Poker... It's getting cold, Sal. I'm going to take you in.  We'll call Angela. The guys can help her bring you home... Did I tell you I was going on a trip?
Phantom Mary?
No!
Down I would say... What would you say?
Looks like ya gonna take office just in time, Chief.  Things need straightening up in this city.
Witnesses say some wacko went Judge hunting with a late model.  I got an artist working on a computer composite now.
What did you say?
Remember my promise.
You can't win like this.  You'll only get older.  This is what you wanted!
What is it?  I'm about to go on.
Sir, your dinner with the union leaders begins in an hour.  Your wife will meet you there, so we can leave whenever you're ready.
NPA metamorphosis should biologically slow him down.  That's when we'll get him.
I also PVC'd you.  Youngest Officer promoted to Sergeant. Two CMs.  Four honor medals...
Good night, Wade.
No thank you, sir.  Smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema, and may complicate pregnancy.
You're not pregnant, are you?
Sanchez...?
What's it mean?
They always are.
Papers.  Last Medcheck two weeks ago. A-1.  Disease free.  Guaranteed by the State.
Belle Dee. I'm from over the mountain.
Jabez! Careful --
And two unpara-- unparalleled Cir-cass-ian beauties? What is that?
No, Daniel -- they are not race horses. They are good old friends of mine. I call 'em Constitution and Bill of Rights, the most dependable pair for long journeys. I've got one called Missouri Compromise, too, and then there's a Supreme Court -- fine, dignified horse, though you do have to push him now and then.
Daniel, you ought to be in bed.
But I like the new one better.
Why, of course, Hank -- I've always got time for a neighbor. What's on your mind?
What a fine boy you have, Jabez. How old is he now?
Afraid ... of what?
That's right, Mr. Stone -- there is --  -- just one little formality. I'd like your signature here -- see. And when it's done -- it's done for seven years.  It's our usual form. Of course -- we may be able to take up the question of a renewal in due time.
Are they all as -- small -- as that?
Small? Oh, I see what you mean. Why, they vary.  Now a man like Daniel Webster, if I ever get hold of him, I'd have to build a special box for him and even at that, I imagine, the wing spread would be astonishing.  In your case --
About what?
You know darn well it is.
Seems like it's my fault, Mr. Webster.
Mr. Webster -- I'd like you to meet my wife, Mary.
No -- you haven't time -- You haven't time for your mother, or your wife, or your child.
Why of course --
Jabez -- help!
Now, Jabez! I've got on my Sunday bonnet and I'm going to church with my husband. Almost the first time since the beginning of winter -- and if that isn't an occasion, I don't know what is.
Jabez, don't you remember your own wedding? We said it's for better or worse. We said it's for richer or poorer.
To save us work on the spring plowing?
But I'm glad to be home again --
Tired?
There's hope and promise in it, Jabez -- Planting and promise of good harvest to come.
Mary, get three cups of camomile tea for the Squire and the rest. They all feel colds coming on.
But Jabez, I never said that!
Jabez! What kind of talk is that for the Sabbath? And me a-reading the holy word!
There! Guess that ought to hold good. Put him down here, by the fire, Mary.  But we don't want to get him too close -- we'll have roast pork for supper.
Yes -- and you figgered right, consarn it!
That's a word you're too free with lately, Jabez, consarn this and consarn that ...
Yes -- I was getting the seed -- I stumbled -- I saw one of the boards warped up a bit -- and -- there it was.
Well -- that's comforting!  Supper.
Well, thank the Lord you can always depend on New England for weather. We've got enough for the whole United States.
Money -- money's a funny thing, ain't it, Ma?
Ma -- and yet, a man could change that, couldn't he?
I say -- it don't matter.
Now that's the way to talk, Son! I know you worked hard for that crop. But we'll make out.
Ma -- is she? --
I want you to fix these fish!
Ma -- Ma -- it's all right, Ma!
You throw mighty far, Jabez -- almost into the pigsty.
Let her be, son. She'll do all right. You better get yourself straightened out.
What's that?
So you've made up your mind to go to the party.
What are you looking for, Colonel?  What's your name?
Martin Van Buren Aldrich and my Pa's the only Democrat in Cross Corners. He said you had horns and a tall, Mr. Webster, but I ain't seen 'em yet.
Well, Martin, I only wear them in Washington -- that's the trouble. But if you ever come down there, I'll show them to you.
Gee, would you, Mr. Webster? Honest?
Well -- she hardly ever comes here -- she's not the type of woman who cares to live in the country. Yes -- I'm all on my own -- sometimes it makes you feel a little lonely --  Do you mind if I indulge?
Someone to see you, Dan'l!
Just someone from New Hampshire!
Foreign? And who calls me a foreigner?
Very well. -- You shall have your trial, Mr. Webster. The case is hardly one for an ordinary jury --
Argyle.  Don't you take this stuff?
The girl was off today.  Hey, I didn't expect you to sit up front.  So, your lady live out here?
The past six months.
But meant her moving here.
It's corny, but I could live with it.
The police...?
How about his job?
What are you going to do?
John, they're giving me a few minutes to try and talk some sense into you. I know you think you're doing your job, and I can appreciate that, but you're just dragging this thing out. None of us gets out of here until these people can negotiate with the LA police, and they're just not gonna start doing that until you stop messing up the works.
I don't know it!  get on a Goddamn jet to Tokyo and ask the chairman! I'm telling you!  You're just going to have to kill me --
Whoa, Hans, now you're the cowboy?
After all your posturing, all your speeches...you're nothing but a common thief.
Well, Cappy Roberts retired out here a couple years ago.  He said I could bunk with him.
Didn't we have this same conversation in July?  Damn it, John, there was an opportunity out here -- I had to take it --
Excuse me, I'm looking for --
Yeah.  How'd you know?
No, but it's gonna need one hell of a paint job and a shitload of screen doors.  One spotters say you got two with that blast.
The way you drove that car, I figured you for the streets.
Roy?  You still with us?
I...I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to make a joke of it.
Powell?  What's going on?
No.  I never smile any more.
If you're right I'm gonna back you a hundred percent, you know that.
Hey, Sonny!  I'm watchin' it on TV!
What about the kids?
Heidi, I'm dying.
Heidi, for Christ sake, shut up! Will you shut your fucking mouth and listen?!
Heidi - why didn't you come down here?
Jesus - what - I'm afraid - I'm gonna get shot or whatever.  You oughta see it on TV, the guns, the cops, they got cannon, machine guns, they're loaded with gear.
Sonny, I'm gettin' real bad vibes.
Well, how'll I get home?
Sonny, there's somebody under that desk over there... I'm sorry...
That's why I can talk to you, as an equal, Sonny.  You got to merge your whole soul with God.  And then you are Him and one with the Holy Ghost.
Yeah.  You said... I thought you were never getting out?
Ooohh....
That... huh... they just shoot you with drugs.
Yeah.  So how are you?
What do you mean... what am I talking about?  Do you realize that you say that to me every day of your life?  I am dying.  Do you know... do you realize the death that you are spreading around to the people who are around you?
Now don't give me that deep shit now.  Don't start with that shit.
I'm getting out of here, man.  I'm not going to stay here and I'm not giving up.  I mean, huh, they're going to kill me, anyway.  So fuck it!  But, if I can get out of this... I am going to get out. And, how I'm going to do it is to get a jet out of here and I'm flying the fuck out... That's all, Leon.  If you want to come with me, then you're entitled... you can come.  You're free to do what you want.
You're really crazy.
Who the fuck knows?  I think we're gonna go ... we worked it out to Algeria.  So, I don't know.  So I'll go to Algeria.
Denmark?  Sweden?
Sal?  Yeah... Sal is with me.
Shit...
All right, enough!  Who the fuck is on the phone... anyway?  Is that you Moretti?  You on the phone?  Will somebody talk to me?
That's good then.  You've found something.
Do you still want the operation?
Right.  See you sometime.
Yeah... I'll write a song.  Ha, ha. I don't know.  Life is funny!
What kind of things, Leon?
He needed money?  For the operation for you?
I don't know what to say to him.  I can't.
How many you got in there?
Call me Sonny-boy.
Call me whatever you want.
What do you want?
So, what were they doin'?  You're tellin' me you had nothin' to do with that back there?
Bullshit ... I don't walk to talk to you ...
Wait a minute ... everything you asked for is on the way ...
I'm not ... I'm not ... you're gettin' a bus ... you're gettin' a bus ... the jet's comin' into Kennedy ... and your wife's on the way ... what else do you need? What else can I get you?  Listen, I don't know how you can do better ... see that man over there ... the FBI guy ...
Yeah?
Well, they go to guard school.
To what ... learn how to shoot? They don't get a gun.
You see what we're dealing with? They want me to kill all of you!
You know more than the Doctor? You're not okay, look at you.  Come on ...  ... let's get him out ...
Hey!  I'm tryin' to help you.
No you don't.
You know - I had a job once.  I used to work in a bank.  I had been training ... I used to have a boss ... Mr. Don Frio ... he wore a toupee ... I wonder if you'd hire me if I came in here and asked you for a job ...
Are you a lawyer?
You got Bank Americard?
Because I'm scared, that's why. You never smoked?
Because I don't want cancer.
You shouldn't start now.
Are you serious?  About throwin' a body outta here if we have to?
He wants one.
Dead or alive?

They're trying to come through the door!
Sal?
Why couldn't he talk about that here?
No more favors.  That's all over, Sonny.
Listen, I'll never make it.  I'll have to go to the toilet.
Fuck!  We did it!
What about, ah, non-union occupations?
I don't want to be paid.  I'm here with Sal and eight other people ... and we're dyin'!  They're gonna blow our guts out, man!  You're gonna see our brains onna sidewalk! How's that for all you shut-ins and housewives to look at!  You gonna help, or you just put it on instead of AS THE WORLD TURNS?  We're dyin' here!  What have you got for me?
This is Drake Bishop.
<i>Well... I think that these are the gentlemen who robbed us. I'm also a bail bondsman out of Los Angeles. I can track down and deliver these crooks to you... for a small finder's fee of course.</i>
<i>The Bounty Hunters have arrived. They will drop off the money in exactly one hour.</i>  <i>Where do you want to meet?</i>
What?
<i>Mr. Cigliuti?</i>
I've already formulated a plan.
My armored car business. We just signed a new insurance policy in Nevada. There's a loophole.
Ms. Harvey... my name is Taryn Miles. I'm a criminal psychologist working for the FBI. I'm here to ask you a few questions.
Where is the money?
Take us to Vegas. <b> EXT. DESERT ROAD -- DAY </b> The crew rides in the back of the Wanderer's truck toward Vegas. <b> INT. VEGAS SECURITY LOCKDOWN -- NIGHT </b> Domino stares at Taryn as she returns to the table.
Cunt.
Listen, dick-fuck. I had a good run while it lasted. Now I've got ten million in the bank. <i>I'll never have to work again for the rest of my life.</i>
Ain't nobody gonna call me a bitch without some payback.
How you be?
Check this out.  Y'know Sal's.
Talk to me.
I'll fuck you up quick two times.
I'm gonna leave now.
And?
What did I tell ya 'bout dem pictures?
It's so nice to see a family hanging out together.
Mother Sister, you've been talkin' 'bout me the last eighteen years. What have I ever done to you?
Besides that.  Da Mayor don't bother nobody.  Nobody don't bother Da Mayor but you.  Da Mayor just mind his business.  I love everybody. I even love you.
Where did you sleep?
I didn't.
What makes Sammy run?
Later for Sal.  Y'know, sometimes I think you're more concerned with him than me.
Don't worry about it.
It's Miller time.  Let me go give these Koreans s'more business.
Hey!  What did I say?
Mookie, no cursing in the store.
Mookie, if your friends can't behave, they're not welcome.
Yeah, do you know 'em?
Don't even ask about your money. Your money wouldn't even pay for that window you smashed.
You're right, a kid is dead, but Mook, this isn't the time.
We both do.
You only pay me two-fifty a week.  I owe you fifty bucks.
It's supposed to be even hotter today.
Make dat money.  Get paid.
Yeah!...I'm goin' to the beach for the first day in fifteen years. Gonna take the day off and go to the beach.
Tina, what do you want me to do?
Before I get off work.
Tina, you are too slick.
I've been working hard, getting paid.
Your memory is really getting bad.
How long then?
Trust you?  Because of trusting you we have a son.  Remember your son?
Mookie, I told you already it's too fucking hot to make love.
It's 'pose to be cold.
Feels good.
Shaddup, Vito.
Fuck dat shit.  I deliver pizzas. That's what I get paid for.
What?
If you don't make a stand, he's gonna be beating ya like a egg for the rest of your life.
Pino, no joke.  C'mon, answer.
I'm listening.
You listening to me?
I should have Vito go with you all the time.
Mookie, you're fucking up.
How ya doin', Mookie?
Sleeeeew sheek baw...
I've been assigned to write an article about you for the school paper. It was either a feature on you or the new four-color ink pens at the student store.
That's because Ms. Heller doesn't want you to know this whole thing is a scam.
Ooh gross.
That's okay. Lloyd's really the one teaching the class.
She says that she's got more important things to do now that the new mall opened.
Probably because we've never met.
I think it's just over there.
I don't know. I'm pretty familiar with the school and I've never seen that "X". But... I do know something.
We're part of a special class taught by the lunch lady, er, I mean Ms. Heller. Maybe you'd like to join us, it doesn't require any walking.
Oh, yeah. Well I almost always beat Captain Rob.
No! Captain Rob is seven feet tall, wears an eye patch, got a hook for a hand...
Sounds like a pirate.
Peg leg?
Whoa. What was that?
Where did you learn that word?
What's with horse-boy, now he's a bright shiny sun?
You're it.
Who cares? Chicks are for fags.
Come on, Lloyd. You must know someone I can talk to.
But-
A blimp.
If you have to ask, you don't know.
PRINCIPAL COLLINS is her boyfriend!
But my mom gave me the map.
Enough! Look what this cursed chest is doing to us.
Guys, this is much better.
Yeah! No more clicks and whistles! Now she speaks perfect English!
Oh my God! She's two-timing PRINCIPAL COLLINS!
Hold up. First, we have to decide who gets who, remember? No more competition?
Damn! What are the odds?
MS. HELLER, mind if I tag along on your field trip? I'm thinking of doing a story on your special needs class.
Oh, you're good.
I thought I told you to get lost.
You're just jealous.
Well I was born in St. Louis.
Where'd that come from? He holds up a giant key chain.
So could you get us into the principal's office?
Well, something stinks.
What are you doing?
I don't know if you'd call us "friends"...
Well he missed a great pot of stew!
How was that?
We're not crazy. We're "special". PRINCIPAL COLLINS wants us to have our own classroom!
I think you did it.
So far so good. We'll need more pictures. Why don't you take them on a field trip tomorrow.
Oh, things. Photos. Tapes. I tape everything that goes on in this office.
The chest! The chest that I put my papers in.
The documents. The photos! The tapes! The evidence.
The evidence of what?
Love it!
The ring?... he was brought to us as is, Baron.  I...
My thanks.
Their minds are so.... They move in strange directions....
Many machines on Ix... new machines.
Yes, Sire.
Shield practice? Gurney... we had practice -- this morning..... I'm not in the mood.
You know the ancient tongues?
Paul, this is the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam. She is going to... observe you...  Please... -- REVEREND MOTHER Jessica, you know it must be done. I enjoin you to stand guard at the door and practice the meditation of peace.
Don't touch my mother...
A million deaths are not enough for Yueh...
He knows.
No.
Are you suggesting a Duke's son is an animal?
It burns.
 I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear... I will permit it to pass over me and through me. -- The Reverend Mother moves her face up to his. Her ancient face with its metal teeth gleaming inches away breathes hotly. She is smiling.
The person who can be many places at once... the one who bridges space and time.... He will look where we cannot.
Where?
Did they try and fail?
Well he isn't... and he won't die... Tell me he won't die!
You mustn't speak of...
Bring me two more Beefeater martinis. Eddie will have another whiskey, Dagmar's a Rum-and-coke, Moustapha and King are chablis -- hey Bela, would you like a wine?
Eddie, where are we?  We passed that carwash twenty minutes ago.
Because I'm planning on dying soon.
The old ones were much spookier. They had castles, full moons...
I never thought of that.
Bela! It's so great to see you!  And eight o'clock on the dot.  Right on time!
Eh, forget it.  What else is big?  Teenagers!  Jailbait pics!  Yeah... You got the juvenile delinquent, his girlfriend from the wrong side of the tracks --
Who do I play?
Let me take you to the hospital.
Morphine, with a demerol chaser.  Eddie, I'm so broke.  I don't know what I'm gonna do...
"Oh, tract housing, huh?"  Laugh. "You need a new real estate agent."
"Dear, you are a woman of super strength and beauty.  A lovely vision of exquisitely beauty -- shit!"  Damn!  Eddie, I'm sorry I can't remember all this.  I'm an old man. It's too long.
Bela, I don't know what I'm doin' anymore...
But maybe not.
Goddamn, it's cold!
Once you're in it, it warms up.
It'll be wonderful.  We'll be at peace.  In the afterlife, you don't have to worry about finding work.
I've got some good news.  The doctor says you're all better.  You can come home.
So Eddie, don't we need a sound crew?
And once I'm a woman, Jean-Claude and I are getting married --
Rolling.
There's no such thing as a psychic. People believe my folderol because I wear a turban and a black tuxedo.
Cris, you made it.  Thanks a lot.
Will he be okay?
What?
Orson Welles was 26 when he made "Citizen Kane."  I'm already 30!
Sweetie, you won't believe it!  I've got the most incredible news!
Yeah!  I met a movie star!  Somebody <u>really big</u>!
Of course it is.  And that's why you should play the part.
Toss us out on our ass.
Dolores, don't you understand?  I'm a director now!  I made "Glen Or Glenda."  Directing <u>is</u> my day job.
Ed, it's over.  I need a normal life.
The other sixty-thousand you said you'd give me.
Hey big shot, get off your ass.  They need a potted palm over in the Carl Laemmle Building.
Yeah...?
You could say that --
Okay -- you know what you do?  You produce a film in a commercially proven genre.  And after it's a hit, you take the profits from <u>that</u>, and make the twelve Apostles' movies.
Graverobbers from <u>what</u>??
What'd you give him all the lines for??  He's unintelligible!
Really?  Was the third act too intense?
But Tor, it's a starring part! You're second billed.
Yes?
I can't believe it.  These sound like <u>my</u> problems!
It's the damn money men.  You never know who's a windbag, and who's got the goods.  And then they all think <u>they're</u> a director...
Ugh, I hate when that happens.
Can I help you?
There's still a sex-change --
Yeah!  Five pages right before it ends!  The rest of the show is about some schmuck who likes angora sweaters.
Gee, I used every frame of film we shot.  Maybe they won't notice.
Um, I guess --
Why not??
Hello.  You're sleeping in a tuxedo.
Oh.  Congratulations.
How long's he been here?
He's better.  Thank you for asking.  How's your friend?
No.  I'm from back east.  You know, All-American small town... everybody knew everybody, I was a Boy Scout, my dad worked for the post office...
You know, when you rewrite a script, it just gets better and better!
Uh, atomic energy?
I can't get it to go up.
Huh?!
I don't understand.  Do you want my autograph?
Uh, yoo-hoo.  Excuse me!  Sorry to interrupt, but I got some big news.
Don't you think angora has a tactile sensuality lacking in all other clothing?
Please, be compassionate.  I'm your husband!
Norman Rockwell. He painted magazine covers. Folksy. A mailman, a boy scout, a kid visiting a doctor...
I'm going to be living with my brother. He's not in such good shape as I am, but... I'm looking forward to the pillow fights.
What do you mean "they're gonna have him die?"
No, uh...
I bet my career on you. You'd better be good.
You know, everything you asked me to do I did. I call you for advice about Shari you say -  "Leave her be, see other people for a while." You just wanted me to get involved with Jill because it made for a better show.
I'm Dr. Geller. Your mother is just lying down for a few minutes. we gave her something to calm her down.
Very quick. Between you and me, it's not a bad way to go. Making love to your wife... it's very sweet.
Hotel? What were they doing in a hotel?
You said that.
I was at this comedy club last week and this comedian says "If you're over thirty and your job requires you to wear a name tag, you screwed up your life." And I'm laughing and then I realize I wear a nametag.
Eddie? ...
Send him away.
No. Maybe he's watching.  Tell him you're sorry. Tell him you'11 stay away from that girl.
Mm.
He... apologized, he begged me. He can be very... charming when it suits his purpose.
The doctor said you were having sex.
Don't tell Al. He doesn't know.
You're famous. Somebody called me. What are you doing in a place like this?
Why shouldn't I be in a place like this? I'm a whore!
And how is this helping? come on say, good-night to all your new friends and let's go home.
What are you talking about?
She left. She moved. She got Fed-Ex to give her a transfer and she left. She couldn't stand it anymore. We had people, news people, regular people, just sleeping in our hallway, going through our mail, our garbage. I mean it was she couldn't take it anymore. Now I've got to move. I can't afford this place by myself.
Well, no. You agreed to stay on the air as long as we asked you to. The station entered into this on that understanding. If you had refused we'd have begun this with somebody else. You can't just change the rules in the middle of the game, son. It's not fair to us. More importantly, it's not fair to the viewers. They're interested in you. They've devoted hours and days and weeks of their lives to you.
What are you doing?
I mean bad.
Leave. Go.
You know, the big machine that cleans the ice.
That's lucky.
I have no privacy. Even now! I'm crying and I can't stop and they won't go away. And now it's going to be another month!
Page three of the Post.
Twenty-nine.
It's not their fault.
Kinda'.
Yeah, but let's stay on one subject. Whoever that person is is going to be famous. They'll be able to get whatever they want. They'll ... trust me, this is my business.
What is?!
I got your message. Way to go!
I ... I'm not gonna do it.
What?
What?
All right. Let me ask you something... are you happy like this?
Screw off.
Yeah?!
Okay, I just wanted to get your attention. My name is Ray and my friend Bucky and I design video systems. You've got an office or a big home, we'11 come out there design you an entire system.
Hey, Ed. Did you hear about Marcia?
Ray --
Hi.
Why me?
Yeah.
Me?! That's you!
And each contestant gets one of these.  An "I tried to screw a network executive" tee-shirt.
Ray, where do you keep the glasses?
Quite a shithole, isn't it?
The whole time? Eighteen years?
Ohh... do you own a cat?
That Ray was a pig. Ed is doll. You latch on to him honey.
Tu
pierdes.
what?
Thank you.
Come on, doit. Doit. Fill me up. Come on, fill me up
Having a problem with your eye there?
Mr. M.?
Okay.  But we're still missing something key here.  What are we missing?
Now at the end of her junior year, Tracy was poised to win the presidency of the student body.  And so far she was running unopposed.
You can put those in my box.  I'll look at them tomorrow.
NO, that's fine
I can't wait to start campaigning.
Should be easy.  So far no competition.
Were you or were you not working in the Watchdog office over the weekend?
6:30.  How do you know what time the posters were torn down?
What's this?
That little bitch made a fool of us I want her out of the election. Getting everybody all riled up like that.  She's finished, you hear me? Washed up.
Well, that speech she gave -- it was pretty, you know, pretty out there.  But we'll get to the bottom of it.  Don't you worry. Mr. McAllister is going to see to that.  Right, Jim?
Well, this is hard for me, but I think it's important to be honest. Don't you?
I can't afford this stuff right now.
No, I... uh, didn't know that
Hey Yeah?
Yeah, no, she's a go-getter, all right.
And on Halloween we could have a haunted house.  But a really good haunted house, not like those cheesy bad ones.  You know, more like the radio station ones.  This one would be really scary.  And for Homecoming -- well, you know how last year's theme was -
Just one more thing.  So, Mr. M., uh, do you think Tracy's going to be okay? I saw her face after the assembly, and I think she's taking it pretty hard.
Whoa! Easy, Fouch. I don't like where you're going.
I'm not like you.
I don't care.
For what?
Yeah.  So guess what happened.  So Mr. McAllister, he --  Oh hi. Lisa.
I just thought, well, last time you got suspended you fell so behind and -
You use words like that, you might make me mad.
Yeah I know.  Patchett's running whores and judging by his address, probably something bigger on the side.  He doesn't want any attention.
You say 'fuck' a lot.
He had you cut to look like Veronica Lake?
When I was ten, my old man threw a bottle at my mother.  I guess I got in the way.
They're yours.  Take them.
You know him?
What?  That new mystery girl you've been seeing?
Susie, I told you I didn't approve of that boyfriend.  He was too old for you.  You let him come into this house and be fresh to me.  I went out one day and old Mrs. Jensen next door saw Susan's boyfriend and another man and thought she heard a ruckus.
What's through here?
Then something goes wrong.  Meeks gets killed.  Maybe Stens got greedy, killed Meeks and left him under his girlfriend's house.  The night he died, Stens was all mysterious.  Said he had something big going down.
I'm a homicide detective.  Where were you last night?
Why were Lefferts' eyes black?
Oh, yeah.  That was a long time ago.  Before your day.  The last few years he's been muscle for hire.  But I heard he's disappeared.
If she was sitting here, then it's facing the wrong way.  What are these smears in the blood?
<u>Ear plugs</u>.
I'll testify, sir.  I'm not afraid to do what's right.
Oh?  you feel that way about people, too?
Ty and Larry fuck with that shit, not me.
I... No.
Tell that to Jack Vincennes.  To Stensland.
<u>No</u>.
John, I doubt you've ever drawn a stupid breath.  Don't start now.
You think golden boy can handle it, Cap?
L.A.P.D.
I want you to follow Bud White.
I ain't a priest, Lieutenant.  I can't hear your confession.
Do you make the three Negroes for the Nite Owl killings?
What?
Is there more to that, or do I have to guess?
I've given up angles for awhile. I just want to solve this thing.
What's that for?
With tinsel and plastic icicles and... on his penis, sir.
Not good enough.
I know who you are.  You're the policeman Bud told me about.
Why not?
You're the first person to ever call me tough.
Okay.  Look, if it helps, Bud hates himself for what he did.
A sweet man.
My daughter was a virgin!
Sid, why would a guy like Pierce Patchett get involved with running dope and hookers?
This is Sgt. Vincennes. Requesting a name and address on a phone number.  Hollywood zero-one- two-three-nine.
And you were the last one to talk to him.
Tired of chasing squirrels around the park?
Turn on CNN.
Goddammit, shut the fuck up and turn on CNN!
It is?
Tell us about Rachel Banks.
You've heard of the National Security Agency?
I don't know what that means.
Like a LowJack, but two generations ahead of what the police use. It pulses at 230 Giga-Hertz.
230 Giga-Hertz. They use that band for the Aquacade Spy-SAT uplinks.
Exposure. They can't have it. They wanna learn what you know and then deal with it.
No shit.
Did you call anyone?
What do you mean?
You don't get it. They go through your phone records. They fuckin' monitor everyone you called in the last--
What the fuck?!
You sure?
You're driving.
That wasn't so hard.
Let's not do the tire thing anymore, okay?
These guys are incredibly persistent.
What do you mean? Who can buy this kind of equipment.
Neil, thank you for your help.
I don't know anything about this. Well, I mean, I know a <u>little</u> about--from a certain perspective. My point is, I don't want to do anything foolish.
I think she'll like this very much.
I know, but--
<u>Wildlife</u> footage, for God's sake. I don't see how he could've slipped you something that the FBI would be interested in.
Because my life is being ruined.
I'm sorry. Detective Morelos.
No, sir, I'm not involved with that. I'm doing a quick follow-up on a bus accident took place a few nights ago. Your name keeps coming up.
What kind of trouble.
Why'd you go to Harrison's?
We won't suspend the civil rights of the good people.
Stacy, I found out like this. This is the first I'm <u>hearing</u> of--
It's not a real picture, Stacy, it's been doctored-up.
I know, but listen--
Are you sure you're safe?
It's a brand new card.
Sir?
Do you like fish?
He doesn't work that way.
Thank you.
The IRS contacted me this morning. They say my lifestyle and receipts exceed my income.
My firm'll represent you. Free of charge.
I've never met him?
What're you gonna do, Rachel? You gonna sit in a bar in Baltimore? You want your job back? You want a life?
Yeah?
--otherwise we may have to--
Otherwise you may have to what?
I got a call this morning from a source I trust. The Post is running a lead this afternoon about your involvement in the Bellmoth investigation.
You're firing me.
Dad!
No.
I love my blender.
Your Bellmoth case. The FBI thinks there might be mob ties.
No, I--
Bobby? Piece of advice?
Jerry?
Yeah?
He got hit by a bus.
You would?
Yes. But we can't.
Fuck you.
I said fuck you.
30 minutes ago you said we had him. What in hell's goin' on out there?
He's clever? He had help?  Oh.
No sir.
Not yet. He's near "M" and 34th. I've got an ELSUR unit on the scene now. A residential building. Twelve units.
What's your ETA?
For Daniel Zavitz. I just need a signature.
Yes?
Puffed cheese?
Daskylusâ€
How much did you pay?
Excuse me?
This is an incredible story - about a man hunting an Ostrich, he's been telling me about Zerzura, he thinks he's been there, but his map, the route he's describing, he couldn't survive the journey now, but he's a poet, so his map is poetry - and now we're onto an Ostrich.  I'm telling her your map is poetry. The Arab shrugs.
I do not.
We took several photographs, there's no need.
I'd like you to have them.
This is not very good, is it?
Fiction.  We had a house on that coast and it never rained blood. Go on.  More.
Do they know them?
Don't.
A woman should never learn to sew, and if she can she should never admit to it.  Close your eyes.
Now.
What else?
What do you hate most?
I don't care to bargain.  It's full of saffron, just in case you think I'm giving it to you to encourage your sewing.
Don't do this.
Why did you hate me?
It's so cold.
Don't leave me!
Are you mad?  Katharine loves it here. She told me yesterday.
Very well.
Count Laszlo de AlmÃ¡sy. The Officer is writing this down.  A glance at his Corporal.
Her hands and feet were tied.
Those maps belong to His Majesty's Government.  They're confidential. They shouldn't be left lying around for any Tom, Dick or Mary to have sight of.
Why do they care about our maps?
What do we find in the desert? Arrow heads, spears.  In a war, if you own the desert, you own North Africa.
How are you?
Your leg will be fine.  A lot of shrapnel came out - I saved you the pieces.
Just kiss me.  It would mean such a lot to me.
Would it? She kisses him, very softly, on the lips.
Are you Hana?
They're fresh.  I haven't eaten an egg inâ€have you noticed there are chickens? You get chickens in Italy but no eggs. In Africa there were always eggs, but never chickens. Who separates them?
If you said yes I would have had a reason.  You should let me redress those bandages.  Before you go.
Where've you been?
It's a week.  We didn't know where you were - or if you coming back, or -
Irving Berlin.
And did you never see Katharine? You never got back to the Cave?
Darling, for goodness' sake!
What?
Oh - I've found plums.  We have plums in the orchard.  We have an orchard! She has peeled a plum and now slips it into his mouth.
I'm not laughing at you.  Go on, please.
I should try and move your bed.  I want you to be able to see the view.  It's good, it's a view from a monastery.
No sand.  That's your drugs speaking.
Could I have a cigarette?
He needn't disturb you.
He keeps asking me questions about you. Do you know him?  Do you recognize him?
He wants us to move out, says there could be fifty more mines in the building. He thinks I'm mad because I laughed at him.  He's Indian, he wears a turban.
Really?  That's sudden.
You like him, don't you?  Your voice changes.
Hana was just telling me that you were indifferent -
I'm not sewing anything else.
Try this.  I found a great jar of it. Olive oil.  In Naples this was so precious it would have bought you a wife.
You must get away.  Before I cut. I'm not cutting if you're here. He's struggling.  He's going to topple over if he cuts.
Kiss me.  Before I cut.  Just in case.
But if it got late and I hadn't shown up?
Is that what you think?  Is that what you think I think?
I'll always go back to that church. Look at my painting.
And what if he really is a spy?
No.  He's - no.
Hello.
How romantic.  With Fiona I fell over every five minutes.  Ronnie Christened me Lady Downfall.
Why?  Are you German?
How do you know you're not German if you don't remember anything?
Then you were married?
Meaning--
You got a better idea?
I've been following this guy for years. I'm your best shot.
Yeah yeah yeah. What's the status?
You, want to blow the whole thing, go right ahead.
Look, trust me. I know what I'm doing.
He's on to something bigger.
Uh. I'm showing off.
I'm sorry about the scroll, but sometimes you have to lose to win.
Yes. But they don't have a clue.  Why would anyone steal my luggage?
But Roki said--
Maybe I should drive this time.
I'm not here to run errands. I'm here for the Mask.
But--
Motorcycle.
Those are my clothes.
I don't believe this.
And--
Look, I can help. You need a sensor expert. You've got one.
I wondered who'd been giving me a bad name.
Don't worry, I can get rid of this. No trace. And I'll even go fifty fifty, we're partners aren't we?
Our equipment has arrived.
And you've checked the ram to be sure it's synchronized with the clock.
He wasn't.
Bookshelf. Sensors--
What?
You've got everything planned.
What's that?
It's taken me five years at Webber Insurance, nights, weekends, every spare minute, to make this CD. It has all the necessary instructions and confirmation codes to tell their computer to transfer reasonably modest sums out of thousands of those accounts, two, or three million at a crack. Total, eight billion and change.
But those instructions, they're recorded in the computer.
Parachute.
Of course not. It was just a negotiating ploy.
The sign of our partnership.
Jesus God, it's going through.
But--
You should know, when I come back here with the Mask--if anything goes wrong, a detailed description of everything you've done goes to the PRC.
They work off the O2 tank just like the slice pack.
Which is--
You're not the one trying to get all this shit. You think they've just got a Crooks R Us on every corner?
Because I never assume anything.
Oh, look at me, darling. I thought this gentleman was a waiter.
She's good. Give her that. Almost as good as she thinks she is.
My antenna is up, it is fully extended, and I am picking up...what is it? It is, can it be? The boy is in el, u, v.
You'll just have to have faith.
Thirty-five next generation microchips. Copper, not silicon. Value: one million each.
The face decays, the mask doesn't. Art lasts, we don't. That's why art's so valuable. It's a little piece of immortality.
Um, Erin?  Listen.  Even though you're not necessarily my favorite person in the world ...  ... sometimes you're not half-bad.
Mr. Masry, before you go off on some crusade, you might want to remember who it is you're dealing with here.  PG&E is a 28- billion dollar corporation.
Whoa.  Remind me.
I didn't mean for you to leave them in the middle of the floor.  Jesus.  Look at me. What do I have this afternoon?
What?  Hey -- <u>he</u> hit <u>me</u>.
How does someone get meningitis?
Cause first you gotta move, then there's decorating, and if the windows aren't the same size, you know -- you're making all new curtains.  Honest to God, I don't know if I have the energy.  You know, I've been sick. Me and Peter both have.
Yeah, I'm real sorry to hear that.
The what?
No.  Hunh-uh, see, that's not what the doctor said.  He said one's got absolutely nothing to do with the other.
You wouldn't happen to have a little time right now, would you, Donna?
It's a good day.  I feel good.
They took some bone from my hip and put it in my neck.  I didn't have insurance, so I'm about seventeen thousand in debt right now.
If you hadn't used profanity --
I told you the questions might get a little personal --
You did?  Wow, sorry about that.  Listen, Mario's a little not so bright.  He seems to think that you said --
I never lied.  I may have miscalculated -- that happens sometimes, but --
Jane's the office manager.  She handles payroll and petty cash.  But she leaves early on Fridays.
Oh, yeah?
Course I did.
I don't get why they'd do that.
It's not about working hard --
What now?
See, according to this, they were supposed to line the ponds so this shit couldn't seep into the ground.  But guess what --
They skipped that step.
Oh, they knew.  They had to know.
I like this case.
I'm thinking ... I wish someone else had to make this decision.  50 thousand bucks is more than any other California toxic plaintiff has gotten. Ever.  But ...
Maybe.  but maybe not.  We still don't have anything linking this to PG&E corporate. Plus, there's the statute problem.  Plus, we're way short on manpower, so we'd need to bring on more lawyers ...
Not in my world.
Look, this is serious now.  They're talking serious money --
Uh-huh.
And if you had to guess ...
<u>I know</u>.  We're having a meeting, it's all set up --
Fuck Kurt.
Morning!
Ho - ly - shit.
I wasn't gonna --
Right.
Well, it's pretty boring work, shredding -- you gotta find some way to entertain your mind.  So yeah, I took a look.
Oh, hey -- lemme give you a hand there.
Ross.
I guess I did.
Yes.  There's straight-up chromium -- does all kinds of good things for the body. There's chrom 3, which is fairly benign, and then there's chrom 6, hexavalent chromium, which, depending on the amounts, can be very harmful.
PG& -- Are you sure?
Can I play roller hockey?
I said, <u>whose number do you need</u>?
You got more than one?
I'm not a deadbeat.  I work when I need to.
It's been a while.  Maybe I'm just out of practice.
You're around every afternoon?
Thanks for reminding me.
Look, don't take this the wrong way, but don't you think you might be out of your league here?
That's Ed.
It wouldn't kill you to talk about something other than yourself and your own fucking job once in a while --
I'm embarrassed.
Have you been logging on?
What?
You know that thing it says in here about rashes?
Wow, that's soon --
... and when I realized our area's just as bad as Hinkley, I thought maybe my neighbors are all sick too.  So I went and asked.
Yes, My Lord.
Asteroids don't concern me, Admiral. I want that ship, not excuses.  How long until you can have Skywalker and the others in the Millennium Falcon before me?
Soon, Lord Vader.
He can do it.
The boy is our last hope.
I feel The Force.
Luke, I will not lose you to the Emperor, as I lost Vader.
Turns on Lando, the newcomer, with an ominous growl.
Barks a doleful farewell.
Our destruction?  Who?
The son of Skywalker.  You must destroy him ... or he will be our undoing.
But, if he could be turned, he would be a powerful ally.
What is it?
He doesn't make sense to me either, Chewie.
That bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind.
Not you?
An Imperial probe droid.
This baby's got a few surprises left in her.
Stop that.
Sure, they're safer.  You always know what they're going to do. Trouble is, it gets a little dull.
You could have warned him before you shut him off.
Then we have to find a safe port around here.  Got any ideas?
No thanks.
Why you slimy, double-crossing no-good swindler ... am I glad to see you.
You don't know much about much if you think Vader won't want us dead before this is over.
What about Leia and the Wookiee?
That was never mentioned.  Neither was this bounty hunter taking Han. I hope you haven't forgotten our bargain.
Chewie's right.  We must try to save Han.
Sure I did ... once.  It turned out lousy.
The deflector shields are gone.
We've picked up something outside the base in zone one, moving East.
I have this ... feeling.  I'm not sure, really ...
Lando, is he alright? ... Lando? Are you there?  How's Luke?
Why not me?
I will not fail you.  I'm not afraid.
Master, moving rocks is one thing, but this is a little different.
Free your mind and return he will.
The fear does not reach you.  You have learned more than I anticipated.
You'll find I'm full of surprises.
There is much Obi-wan did not tell you.  Come, The Emperor will complete your training.
The Hoth System?
It won't get through the blockade.
Do you have a name?
No -- clothes.  Stevie, they changed into them.
With particular emphasis on the cranial and oral areas.
The cigarette girl in New Vegas was an undercover cop. She injected you with incentive toxin. Right now it's swimming in your bloodstream. It'll start to take effect in 9 hours.
Ooww!
Cuervo...?
I thought he was, but he came back.
I wouldn't be doin' that, Snake.
Wait a minute. All right. Hold on.
You want to stay here, while Cuervo Jones rules the world?
See you in hell, Snake.
That's right, big shot. Unless you do what we want you're not coming back.
I'm here.
Plissken - this is Malloy. Do you have the prototype?
Location.
I couldn't help it, Snake. I had to shoot you. Cuervo made me do it, I swear to God, man.
So maybe we can pull off a Texas switch on Cuervo.
Who?
Hi, Snake. It's so great to meet you. My name's Taslima. I'm a fan of yours.
What are they?
Why don't you get out of L.A.? Take a boat to China, take an airplane to Brazil?  Earthquakes, death, shit. Why do you stay?
Get ready, shitheads. We're comin' in.
I cannot--
My King, I couldn't do it. Excalibur cannot be lost. Other men--
Yield. I have the advantage.
Who is Merlin?
Come now. So much anger for such a little crime? Are you sure there is nothing else troubling you?
Just yes? No mad laughter, no riddles, nothing but a simple yes? That frightens me.
My powers fade, Arthur. I resort to cheap tricks...  Yes! I enjoy every moment of my foolishness, I join in the making of it, so no one can betray me. But you! You betray yourself.
The Queen will be in my charge till a champion steps forward to fight on her behalf.
I have waited long for you. Once you almost saw, but fear blinded you. Why am I served from the chalice?
And there is no maiden in the whole world who inspires you?
There is one.
The law forbids it.
I will run.
No, no, of course not. You are young...
It's clear you are, and it irks me.
Burke take a look at this damn thing it just doesn't make sense.
Why it's perfectly plain, your the teacher at the college, you don't want the building torn down.
Well, he does know the background. I doubt there's any danger in just having him assist. There should be a psychiatrist present, anyway.
What's this?
Your kidding me. What is it a big party or something?
Hello? Yes this is Mrs. MacNeil. Operator you have got to be kidding I have been on this line for twenty minutes.  Jesus Christ, can you believe this, he doesn't even call his daughter on her birthday for christ sake.
This was under Regan's pillow. Did you put it there?
No. Not at all,
Rats?
Yeah or maybe rats now will you just get those traps.
And those lies she's been telling?
Well, she let loose quite a string while I was examining her, Mrs. MacNeil.
Well, specifically, Mrs. MacNeil, she advised me to keep my fingers away from her goddam cunt.
Convulsion?
Oh, I'm very sorry Father. Hi.
I beg your pardon?
Well it just doesn't happen anymore Mrs. MacNeil.
Why, I don't understand?
To begin with it could make things worse.
I can't do it. I need evidence that the church would accept as signs of possession.
What did you do today?
Oh mom, you should have seen this man came along on this beautiful grey horse.  Wasn't it pretty?
We'll see when we get home okay.
Yeah.
Captain who?
I don't know
Hi Chris. Great party.
Where'd you get it then?
I stole it.
Sure.
Hello Regan. I'm a friend of your mother, I'd like to help you.
If you're the devil, why not make the straps disappear?
You'd like that?
But wouldn't that drive you out of Regan?
Bon Jour.
Quod nomen mihi est?
Okay
See the cross of the Lord. Be gone you hostile power. O'Lord hear my prayer.
Shut up!!
You think the killer and the desecrator are the same?
Hey, Father? You like movies?
Very much.
...in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ!!! It is he who commands you! He who flung you from the heights of Heaven to the depths of hell!
Yes?
Yes
Twelve.
Who is it?
I don't know.
No.
Why not?
Little slow tonight.
Now?  Why not tomorrow?  After the show.
So maybe it's time we took a vacation from each other.
Just the same.
Where are our kids? Has he got one of them in there?
Decay unfortunately doesn't limit itself to the denture, Mr. Baker. It spreads into his chest. Then the heart goes. We wouldn't want that, would we?
How will he eat?
What's the gig?
Count it.
Fuck him.
What do you think?
Uh-uh.  How about you?  You seeing anyone?
By the way, we gotta go see Ma tomorrow.
No thanks.
Frank?
So talk to me tomorrow.  After the gig.
We don't get a gig.
The trees.  The flowers.  Nice.
Hey pal, I got a mortgage, all right? I got two kids. I got a wife. Besides, he made the deal. There's no shame in it.
I suppose we can bring it down a little.
All right, all right.  I'm a little tense.
How about these?
Thanks, but I've got plans.
When's the last time we played a wedding, Jack?
Day.  Wednesday.
Right.
Unless you want the right.
Okay.
You leaving that on?
We're gonna be here a week?
Accommodate?  I don't think I know what you mean.
Jack ... Jack ... You're acting like a kid.
Christ, can't you hear it?
What matters to me is we've got the six easiest nights we've had in ten years. So 'Tie a Yellow Ribbon' sounds a little flat. So what?  Nobody's gonna hear it, Jack.  Nobody. So why should you care?
Right.  I love you, Frank.
Fine.
Two hours ago!
The party's over.
Yeah.
You always threw up.
It's a disease, Jack.  We're against it. It's not a moral decision.
Look.  I didn't know when we were going to be on until yesterday.  What was I supposed to do? I had the pianos anyway.
Go ahead.
Right.  It was someone's birthday. Halloran?
Daughter's.  Sweet sixteen.
So what'd you think?
Right.
Uh-huh.  Well, Miss Moran, what is it you'd like to do for us?
Candy Man.'  Is that all right?
This is where the auditions were.
You're an hour and a half late.
How should I take it?
You're an hour and a half late.
Ready?
No. We are not supposed to be backing you up.
Come on.
Just look.  What do you wear? A nine?
Right.
Hey!
We are not a saloon act.  We do not take tips from dirty old men.
Jack, you with us?
You play all these places?
Hey, we're connected.
What'd she sing?
Hey, will you look at that?
What do you say we send a bottle over?
Oh. Yeah.  I gotta bunch of them.
Forget your tie, handsome ... Frank!
That song.  I can't sing it anymore. I'm gonna get sick.
Tom here tells me there's a problem with the pianos.  We were assured they were in tune.
They are in tune.  But not with each other.
I'll call you.
Shit, thank God.  You look like a creep.
Thanks.
Barker.  Jock Barker?
No, I, uh, left a dog here this morning. He needed some work on his mouth.
You want to know if he's okay. Right?
The Park?  It's only two nights. Why throw away a night?
Guess I got a little scattered.
Nothing.
What'd I say?
It means you wouldn't know good if it came up and fucked you.
Soap?
My father proposed to my mother in there.
Long story.
I don't know.  Maybe he thought some rich guy was gonna try and call her.
So ... ?
So how's the cat food business?
Let me get the light.
Did you break a cup, Jack?
I saw his stuff in the bathroom.
Sure.
Do I look wasted -- asshole?
Drive.
Everything I say is wrong. I can't talk to her anymore.
She's only 12.  Some day she'll understand that apathy and absence are just special ways of saying "I love you."
You said you'd be here! You promised me -- you promised Jamie!  What could be more important than that?
Is someone there?
I don't know that.  Maybe Jon's already dead.
You haven't got a chance in hell of fooling Pollux. Castor drinks, smokes and walks around with a 24-hour hard-on.  He's nothing like you.
You're under arrest. Incredibly, you still have the right to remain silent --
Stay away from my family!
Give up, Castor.  People are going to find out.
You'll what?
Just saving the tax-payers the cost of a trial.  So take a hike.
Clarissa left those here.
Did it look like I was siding with him?  Did it?  You want to play with the bad boys, you better be prepared.  Do you have protection?
That's your name, isn't it?
You've got someone in your office.
Just following your example.
I just heard about Castor's fratricide -- rather poetic, don't you think?
Why do I feel like I'm on a blind date?
Gone?
-- what?
I disagree.  You think I've been acting strange.  Like a completely different person.
Back then -- who wasn't?
Yeah Jack, her assistant...
So you left her?  Just like that?
Hey Santa, where are you? Everybodyâ€™s here.
Adelle?
You think I like being here on Christmas Eve, Alan?
But I think I like you better this way...
Mary Janes, Mom.  You promised.
They did a pretty good job.
Who did?
Do you like kids?
Not bad...I shoulda warned you.  Dad always does something really special for their anniversary.
Is it morning yet?
Trouble at work?
Look, you fit the profile exactly.  Thirties, house, kids, financial responsibilities.  You start thinking...this isnâ€™t the life I dreamt about.  Whereâ€™s the romance, whereâ€™s the joie de vivre?  Suddenly, every lingerie ad in the Newark Star Ledger represents a life you canâ€™t have...
So Jack, itâ€™s your wifeâ€™s birthday, got anything to say to her?
Of course. Jack Campbell. I went to high school with you...you played baseball, right?  Youâ€™re doing well...
Yes, thatâ€™s it...yes, we went to high school together.
You never really talked to me.  I wanted to talk to you, man...
Got a minute, Jack?
No.
I've got everything I need.
Miss me, Jack?
What?!
Give me my goddamn life back!
Do I look like I need your money.  It doesnâ€™t work like that and I canâ€™t tell you why.
Thatâ€™s it?  Thatâ€™s all I get?!  A glare?!
...06...14...18...48...right there.  Four numbers...that's two hundred and thirty eight dollar...  Merry Christmas and shit...
You first generation, xenophobic, money-theistic, hot pastrami sandwich making...
Why donâ€™t you let me take this one, Kenny?
I have a bad feeling about this.
You mean donâ€™t go at all? What about my internship?
Are you okay?
Jack...
Uh...that babyâ€™s crying...
Shouldnâ€™t we grab some dinner first?  Maybe a bottle of wine...?
I mean...wow...off the charts great.
Thank you...
Jack...can we afford all this?
You are so not off the hook yet, slick.
Imagine having a life where everything was easy...where you asked for things and people just brought them to you...
Iâ€™m out of the doghouse?
This place is a perk, Kate.
Youâ€™re talking to their new Vice President of Mergers and Acquisitions.
Iâ€™m talking about the best schools in the country here, Kate...
I canâ€™t believe you want to move back into the city.  I thought the reason we left was because we didnâ€™t want to raise the kids here?
But Iâ€™ve done some good things too, havenâ€™t I?
Mrs. Peterson.
Why are you staring at my breasts, Peter?
Do I know you?
He certainly has your number, Alan.
For the money, theyâ€™re hands down the best radial we carry...
Damn...damn...damn...
Jersey?  You know what the traffic's gonna be like?
Merry Christmas...
You didnâ€™t seem to mind offering to help me on Christmas day when you were unwrapping that Prada bag I gave you.
"Sensual blind chick seeks three-ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
Isn't that <u>your</u> speech?
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
I'll be watching over you.
Ben?
What did you wish for, honey?
He didn't mean it.  You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
Stay right.  Left is trouble.
The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your individual needs to --
Yeah, for the last time, I hope.  I'm done with this freak show.  I'm moving back to the real world.
Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here.  And keep it quiet.  I don't need this to hit the press.
Get a grip.  Reed.  We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch.  Just close the shields...
Ben did this.
Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and --
As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission --
Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules.  I've been working on a formula for this.
Yes, thanks.
I'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger.  Can you remember the exact emotions when --
Are you kidding?
Reed.  How close are we to a cure?
Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration --
If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us <u>worse</u>, maybe even kill us.
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
Benes' natural defenses. White Corpuscles -- Antibodies. Once you begin to grow -- and become a menace to the body -- you'll trigger them off... MICHAELS With all the unknown factors in the body, I still say risking five lives for one is something we should reconsider --
Okay to proceed.
Before or after what he wanted to tell you?
-- and why we need you.
Wait a minute! They can't shrink <me>!
Yes?
[LINE OF DIALOGUE CUT OFF]
But we just can't leave him in there! What'll happen to him?
That's beside the point now.  I don't see the sense of going on.
We're pushing oxygen today.
A surgeon might...
Open it! Open it before they get here!
Under a cloud without cause, I take it.
Nothing miraculous about it. Just an interchange of gases. The end product of five hundred million years of Evolution.
Dr. Duval, you are not going through with this! I absolutely forbid it! I'm responsible for the lives of everyone here! I will not allow you or anyone else to leave this ship!
How does it look, Doctor?
In a way -- yes. Those are impurities imbedded in the Lung after a lifetime of 'Civilization.' Carbon from smoke and smog -- specks of dust --
You have no right to blame Duval --
Two in a row?
May I?
Yes, there is.
How's it look?
Well, that takes care of the valve. It was probably caused by that electric shock.
There seems to be something wrong with the Escape Hatch...
Where's my daughter?
Where's my damn daughter? No Jean, no money!
It certainly is, officer. Still got that smell!
Wuddya do?  Carl looks around.
...You c'n'ave my truck. I'm takin' a Shiera.
Okay.
Oh, no, it's real sound. It's all worked out.
Well, it's all just part of this - they don't know I need it, see. Okay, so there's that. And even if they did, I wouldn't get it.  So there's that on top, then. See, these're personal matters.
Yah. Personal matters that needn't, uh -
My wife! What the - how's -
...Blood has been shed.
That's right. And we need more money.
End a April.
Uh-huh.
So he says, 'So I get it, so you think I'm some kinda jerk for askin',' only he doesn't use the word jerk.
Mm.
Shep Proudfoot. That's a name.
He was a little older. Looked like the Marlboro man.
Yah. Maybe I'm sayin' that cause he smoked Marlboros.
Dad! What're they doing? Wuddya think they're doin' with Mom?
The car's not from our lot, ma'am.
... I'm sorry, sir?
Hon? Got the growshries.
Thank you, hon. How's Fargo?
Yeah, the three hundred and twenty thousand dollars, you got the money last month.
Well, but see, I don't have 'em in front a me - why don't I just fax you over a copy -
No, no, fax is -
Well, yah, I got an idea. How's that Ciera workin' out for ya?
Are you calling Stan?
Yah, pretty good.
Whatcha watchin' there?
Well, you know Stan'll say no dice. That's why you pay him.  I'm asking you here, Wade. This could work out real good for me and Jean and Scotty -
What kind of finder's fee were you looking for?
We're good to loan in.
Heck, you don't know! You're just whistlin' Dixie here! I'm sayin', the cops, they can advise us on this! I'm sayin' call a professional!
You're darned tootin'!
Put you in touch with Grimsrud.
Well, yah, but he had a buddy there. He, uh -
Well, that's okay, he's a buddy of the guy ya vouched for, so I'm not worryin'. I just, I was wonderin', see, I gotta get in touch with 'em for, I might not need it anymore, sumpn's happenin', see -
Call 'em up.
Yah? Well, what now, d'ya think?
Yah, I think that vehicle there probly had dealer plates. DLR?
Yah. Say, Lou, ya hear the one about the guy who couldn't afford personalized plates, so he went and changed his name to J2L 4685?
Gotta go?
Yah, that's me.
Well, they're a good outfit.
Uh-huh.
Yah?
Yah.
Copy.
...Chief Gunderson?
Yes, ma'am. Are we the closest PD?
Thanks, hon.
Aw, hon, you're better'n them.
They're good, Norm, but you're better'n them.
When they're stuck with a bunch a the old ones!
Uh-huh.
He's at Norstar.
No!  Look at you!  You're... you're running around in ski masks, exploding things...
We're still men.
...using steroids.  I was a juicer. Diabonol, then, Wisterol -- it's for racehorses, for Christsake.  Now I'm bankrupt, divorced, my two grown kids won't return my calls...
And the second rule about it is... you're not supposed to talk about it. And the third rule...
He was full of pep.  Must've had his grande latte enema.
Hmm?
"Abuse" the copy machine.  There's an image.
Okay.  Where to begin?  With your constant absenteeism?  With your unpresentable appearance?  You're up for review...
It means it was homemade.
Whoever set this homemade dynamite could've blown out the pilot light days before the explosion.  The gas, it seems, was just a detonator.
Red-and-blue Tuinal, lipstick-red Seconals.
We need to talk.
We'll split up the week.  You can have lymphoma, tuberculosis and --
Well, technically, I have more of a right to be there than you.  You still have your balls.
I want brain parasites.
Looks like this is goodbye.
Where have you been the last few weeks?
It's time for you to leave.
Here.
Will you just answer me, for Christsake?!
I deserve that.  Anyway, I've... I've only just realized
I star-sixty-nined you.  I never pick up my phone.  What's up?
Yes... it's a test.
Baggage handlers.  But when a suitcase vibrates, the throwers have to call the police.
If I did have a tumor, I'd name it Marla.  Marla...the little scratch on the roof of your mouth that would heal if only you could stop tonguing it, but you can't.
Look what we've accomplised.  Thirty seconds.
You see, when you travel, everything is small, self-contained--
Thank you.
Delivered from Swedish furniture.
God, it's late.  I should find a hotel...
Is it a problem for you to ask?
You're welcome.  But, I want you to do me one favor.
No.  That's a good thing, isn't it?
The fight.
Anyone?
Oh, yeah.  I didn't know my dad.  Well, I knew him, till I was six.  He went and married another woman, had more kids. Every six years or so he'd do it again -- new city, new family.
Hemingway.  You?
Okay... Ghandi.
I mean, this girl... uh, you're not into her or anything... ?
Yes, I promise.
I... I think I understand.  I think I get it...
What are we doing?
I'm not asking you to.
You broke your promise.  You talked to her about me.
The house is rented in your name.
What about Marla?
I'm going to...
...stop me?
I'm not going...
I wouldn't be doing that.  Unless you know which wires, in what order...
I'm pulling the green wire.
Bob was a grown man.  In any great struggle, there will be casualties. Wouldn't that be implicit in the name?  Project "Mayhem."
Tyler...
Ask me nicely.
Defuse the bomb, please.
Defuse the bomb?
What the fuck -- ?
I'm doing this for us.
Did I tell you I'd call you a fascist dickhead?!
No, no.  This is a man -- this man has a name...
We have a deal worked out with Irvine.
It's free to all.
Yes, it is.
S-S-Stuff.
Why?
Kimberly Burroughs, eh?  What do you want?
What list?
If you have the same power as Alex, you'll be seeing signs soon.  When you see anything creepy or ominous, an in-your-face irony kinda thing? Don't ignore it.  It usually means the difference between life and death.
The second one just dies.  A 16 year old kid.
What did you see?  What am I looking for?
Another premonition?
Then the only way to survive is to get to the hospital and protect Eugene and Isabella for as long as we can.
I'm not sure I understand.
First I'm stuck with Jury Duty, now this nonsense.
Yeah?
Yeah, so what happened?
Billboards about accidents.  Kids yelling "pile up" for no reason. It all felt...just wrong. Just like... 
I tried calling last night but your father --
I didn't.  Until I was dispatched to clean up one of the Flight 180 survivors.
Welcome back.  We did it.  For real.
Want me to drive?
Get ready to smile, five guys per girl.
Relax, you need to chill the fuck out.
"It?"
Billy told the F.B.I. he saw you runnin' away from her house.
Police are coming.
You know what to do.
Is knowing going to make it easier? It makes it harder.
You should have been next. After Lewton, you should've been next. That's the only pattern. You should be dead.
"Intervention?" What are you, God now?!
C'mon, man, like you really thought you were gonna tittie fuck 'em over Greenland, or something?
Me, too.  But my dad doesn't understand. When he's better; you and me, road trip to the City. Catch the Yanks.
I got this... feeling... a weird feeling... I can't explain it...
I believe that... Ms. Lewton's next.
Yes... see, there's this... pattern... that's occuring.
Cuticle lacerations.
And don't pass on the right.
So, why'd you want us to meet you here? Now?
You guys are real... aren't you?
Hell.  This is just like fucking Star Wars, man!
... and there's this guy with a black helmet and cape, right, and he's got this sword... except it's not a sword, it's light...
This clown almost blew mission security on the street.  I'm not jumping with him.
What do you call that?
And a beat-to-shit AK?  Every twelve-year-old in Nam's got one of those.
These guys look like they'd sell their mothers.
How you doing, Brewer?
Can't tell.  Pretty tall.  He's real scrunched up in that thing.
What?  Are you crazy?  We're supposed to take pictures and split. You're gonna blow the whole program.
You comin'?
Brewer!  You know what that thing's packing?
Where did you find this clown?
How did you get started working for the spooks?
What was that?
John.  My name is John.
That's an order.
Not yet.
We don't try to pull out any of our guys if we find them?
Typical...
About 22 hours on site.
Listen, Kirkhill.  I'm a bit of a fifth wheel in your setup here... I thought I'd go out with the extraction team tonight.  Unless you have an objection.
Look, Colonel... we're all adults here.  This is a war.  A very quiet, very intense war.  People get sacrificed.
Look, it was a screw-up, alright? They weren't supposed to find anything.  We thought that camp was empty.
Hardcore outfit.  The best I ever trained.
Yeah.  Big time.
Plus, what else?  Two Silver Stars, four Bronze Stars, two Soldier's Medals, four Vietnamese Crosses of Gallantry and... uh, a handful of Purple Hearts.
Five.  I never wanted that stuff.
Listen up.  You two are married as of now.  Get used to it.
Let's do it.
It happens to be a beautiful love story.  Ya know, you used to like that about me.  You used to say you liked that I didn't make you think so much.  That we could be together and not think...
I get this feeling like I'm... a magnet but I attract shit.  Out of all the people in this city, why did I meet a man who's wife I killed?
I don't know... He's a little disgusting... Although some women go for that.
What?
I think.. I...I realized...I love you.
I'm afraid not ... Then again, I'm not sure. The beating's bad but it's not the problem... It seems he's.. re-experiencing the catatonia... So, like before, he could snap out it in an hour or in thirteen months or thirteen years... ....I don't know. There's no way to tell.
What if I was a relative?
I wanna go...Just let me go...
You shouldn't hang around this neighborhood.
Fine.
... First time in my life I'll be a voice with a body.  Do you know what that means?  What this could lead to?
No, I have to work.
Which ones?
This is it. I'm in hell. Damned to an eternity of idiotic conversation.
<u>What</u>?!
Do you know what the Little People just told me?
The Little People?
A quest?
Him...?
I think you're a very nice... very nice psychotic man.  I really appreciate what you did for me.  It was a very brave and noble thing...
Parry... I'm Jack.
Here...I just would like to help you. I thought...maybe...you could use some money.
I don't need a job. I have a quest.
I take it back - you're fucking deranged... And you're going to get yourself killed trying to get in there!
Isn't it great up here... He's gone now, but we had him on the run! We would've had his ass if we had horses! He's running scared!
Are you all right?
How about the "Hell Merchants"?
What a gyp.
It sounds exciting.
I'm tryin', baby, so don't start gettin' mad now.
Yes.
I'm not going to get up an' leave you.  Now let's go over to El's an' have a good time.
Why can't I go out to your folks' house? Give me one good reason.
Wait a sec. I want Tita to take a picture of you an' me in front of the place...
How do you know it's clean?
I saw a picture of it. Alaska is very clean. It appeared to look very white to me... Don't you think?
I didn't get it, did I?
I'm gonna give you our number, Donnie, just in case...  We're both professionals, if you didn't guess.
I just can't look at you.
Very nice.
I'm going back up tonight. Will you go with me?
Constantly. Night and day. And unless I get up before the birds, I can't get in any practice time for myself...
Why are you being so mean?
Look, can't you see that, what I'm talking about?
Nothing? Then it must be very boring for you here.
Right now I'm going to run a hot tub and soak myself.
Tomorrow, then.
That was beautiful, Robert. I'm surprised...
That's what you said?
As a matter of fact, he's the one who introduced me to Carl...  How are you?
I'm fine.
Robert?
I can't do that. I haven't been being fair to Carl. I have to tell you that.
And living out here, in this rest home asylum, that's what you want?
Did you hear about my misfortune, Robert?
I don't understand why you had to stay in a motel. There's more than enough room here.
It's a Borzoi.
Don't call me "honey," mack.
Pardon me?
What?
Please don't scream at me. I like you, but I don't like the way your attitude is.
Do you have a name?
Yo.
Whadja wanna see me about?
So you got a girl?
I buy them flowers.
What are you going that way for?
Where you goin'?
Oh man, what we gotta leave ar' own neighborhood for?
I'm gonna punch you. What you want with her anyway? You in love with her?
I think she lives down by Pitt.
My friend told me she lived around here.
How do I know you're not lying.
Hey!
Where you know Amanda from?
You live around here?
Yeah.
So he's going. Uh... are there any other tickets charged to the same account?
Fletch, this is dumb.
What? What are you talking about?
I'm about to break that beach wide open, and I don't need some pennyante Woodward and Bernstein getting in the way of my men.
'Your men' might just be involved in all this.
Maybe I'm not going to keep you here.  Maybe I'm gonna blow your brains out.
Ask anybody.
Can I call my Mom? I'd like to tell here how much I've always loved her.
Right, and how long have you had these pains, Mr. Barber?
That's Babar.
That's two.
But not right next to each other. I thought that's what you meant.
Arnold Babar. Isn't there a children's book about an elephant named Babar?
Sure, but the end was so sudden.
He was in intensive care for eight weeks.
Thought so. What for?
Oh, I'll help, Fletch. I'm a slave to that sonofabitch. He busted me, third offense, gave me a choice: Work for him or do fifteen long. All I get out of this is free snort.
Where am I?
Oh, God, I think I'm about to hyperventilate. Have you got a paper bag, or something.
I don't know what you're referring to. Wendy maintains her own residence.
Hey, shut up, okay? I just hate this.
Cash. I'm impressed.
Found it in a cab. That's a grand. Apply the difference to next month.
I'd have been long gone.
Ten days ago?
Has he?
God, I haven't seen you since the wedding.
Rio de Janeiro, maybe?
I'm all ears.
Did it ever occur to you that I might not want to kill you?
Wouldn't they normally be locked?
Very good. My .357. Use it and no one can trace it to you. The room will be in some disarray.
You sure got the hard part.
'Mr. Stanwyk, of Provo, Utah, is a former commercial pilot.'
Married Boyd Aviation. He's no dummy, that's serious coin.
I wonder if that's his doctor.
Did you say cops?
My hero.
His bride. Cute as a button.
Preoccupied with what?
Hi.
No, I think you should stay the same wonderful person you are today.
Just like Alan. It's freaky.
Thanks for the great time.
I'll be leaving now, Mrs. Stanwyk.
Would you care for a drink while you're waiting? I can put it on the Underhill bill.
Excuse me. I have something I'd like to discuss with you.
I'm calling the cops. This is for the cops.
I'm her cousin.
Irwin...
What's 'practically'? Is it Fat Sam? You said you had pictures of him....
Well, there we're in a gray area.
He threw me in a cell, took a gun and a knife and threatened to kill me right there if I didn't promise to give up the story.
Thanks for the vote of confidence, Frank.
What...
Who?
My God, Mr. Fairlane, you look like the Fall of Saigon.
Jonathan was such a beautiful man. No one knew him like I did... Excuse me.  I can't do this now. I'll call you tomorrow.
You're saying you need money.
You're friends with the most obnoxious asshole on the airwaves. The King of the Shock Jocks.  I'm, I'm shocked.
And it's good to see you, Julian. This is my assistant, Jazz.
I don't know, what was the case?
She's just a bundle of energy, a real treasure...
I believe the last time we came across one of these, was at the ballet.  What were your words...  'A fucking C.D.  This case is closed.'
Aha, just what I suspected!
You gave it to the girls for one.
Hey, they blew me.
Zuzu Petals!  Zuzu Petals!  Yes! Who killed Bobby Vomit?  Who killed Johnny Crunch?  Why do people want you so goddamn bad?
You okay?
You know rock-n-roll?  Darlin', I've been in the music industry for as long as you've lived.  I've seen things you can't even have nightmares about... but then I guess I'm just not equipped to know the industry the way you do...
Ford, you were right!
Hello, Mr. Tongue!  What a perv.
Oh how sweet, your friend's got his own star.
When you going to let me work with you?  Why you always fucking with me?
Well what is it?  I'm not Kreskin.
Fuck that, I mean, the heck with that.  I kicked their ass!  Well, I tried.  There were two of them you know...
Yeah, uh, I got some pretty good leads...
Hey, I love you, too, you little jerk.  Jesus, guy tries to make a commitment and he's gotta eat shit.
I need someone to help me with my case load, you interested?  This whole father/son thing, if you're not into it, I mean, it's okay. You know what I'm saying?
Fine!
Oh.  One more thing.  This is personal.  I want you to tell me you're a big sissy.
You gotta be kidding!  This is unfuckingbelievable!  I have to start the evening crawling down Capital Records, I shoulda chose suicide then, but oh no, the night was young!  Next up, my guitar! The second most important thing I own and now it's toothpicks for the homeless on Hollywood Boulevard!  Then, then, after I burned up your brother, Jazz... I should say as a fucking footnote I've usually treated women like shit -- used corsages, the wet spot, you know giving out Domino's Pizza's phone number and saying it's mine... Tonight was different. I felt respect.  I felt love.  Then Jazz left me... and <u>now</u> I get to die!
Shit.
Mr. Doyle.
Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
What about you?  Can you stand a toss?
B.O.C.A.
Got a wife named Angie.
Where'm I goinna get a pizza this time o' night?
Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
Henri... I need one more favor from you.  I know I am imposing...
Everything's smooth.  Beautiful.  I will need a few more days though, the boys think we oughta cool it for awhile -- make sure there's no heat.
Regarde, il te va parfaitement bien!
Je crois qu'on fait une erreur de le prendre avec nous.
Une erreur!  C'est gÃ©nial.  C'est une vedette Ã  la tÃ©lÃ©vision.  Il peut aller partout sans Ãªtre soupÃ§onnÃ©... En plus il a besoin de fric.
It was built in 1917 - and was one of the two heaviest bridges in the world.  The arch is still the largest in the world.
Get up on the bar and show me how you work.  If I like it you don't have to go in.
He got off on six.
That's in France.
Never trust anybody.  You goin' sick?
Come on -- one drink.  Whatta you say?
If that's not a drop or a pickup, I'll open a charge for you at Bloomingdale's.
We got information that there's no shit in the street -- it's like a desert full of junkies with a big score coming in to make everybody well.
Same car.
Hiya, Jesus.
Oh, it's been abandoned for years.
That was over thirty years ago.  I paid for that and then some.
Switches are shorted out.
Don't know what's behind it.
Frank...what's wrong?
I'm off.
I've been talking to Johnny...on the radio.
I know.  He loves that thing.
About what?
How's that?
Next time lets put some money on it.
Daddy, come up and sing the baseball.
Look, I don't really remember how this thing works.
I been Q-ing you all night.  How the hell did you do it?
Sorry 'bout that.
It's really you, isn't it?
No, not yet.
You're still my Little Chief, right?
What's that?
That can't be...that's not gonna happen.
Dad...?
What, Johnny?  What is it?
I gotta take her away, John.  I'm gonna take your mother away.  He can't hurt her if I take her away.
Tell me something good, Chief.  Tell me about the future.
You all right?
It's not your fault, Dad.
But we can, we can do it together. Spirit and guts, remember?
We got him!  Dad you got him!
How the hell am I gonna do that?
What...
You're telling me this maniac is a cop? What the hell am I supposed to do with that one?
What are you doing here, Satch?  You off today?
Go in where?
The warehouse.  Buxton seeds.  It's tomorrow.
My father didn't die in a fire?
Oh don't worry kid, I know where you live.  Now I want you to go upstairs and write this down, buy Yahoo. You got that Space Cowboy.  Y-a-h-o-o. It's a magic word and I never want you to forget it.
Don't choke on your pride, Sull.  You ain't ever gonna catch another one like that.
Maybe you outta lay off a little...
She makes ten.
Ten?  No.  I remember this case.  Three. He killed three women.
Uh, huh.
I'm sure everything'll work out.  She really loves you...
According to the Guinness Book, you passed the World's Record several whacks ago.
How about you and I whacking a couple of balls around?
Think you can figure it out?
Maybe we should do some exercise.
A hammock?
You can say... "Hello, how are you?"... for starters.
You haven't changed a bit.  Always so sure of yourself.  Even when we were kids, when you wanted something, nothing could stop you.
Let's spread out and check all the rooms.  Outside, too.  You stay with me.
And, what about us?
No time to explain.  Just listen. When I yell "stop," you jam on the brakes as hard as you can.  Okay?
Why do you do these stupid things?!
I just want you to like me.
Darren, we better turn around.
You don't know for sure.  What about Roy?  Nobody's seen him.
You become a whole other person when you're out here, Stan.  And I don't like it.
When you stop acting like one... Tommy Jarvis is a very sick boy. And you...
How do you know?  Did you take his temperature?
Why?
Okay, give it back.
You mean you had a bad dream.
Eight times.
Well, let's hope not!
I understand.  However, our audience should be aware that you only charged forty thousand dollars to catch the Idaho skin stretcher.
Jason Voorhees is dead.
You know he's not...and he's coming for you.
Everything going okay?
Steven buggin' you?
Sorry, Di.  I was just going to my car.  I didn't mean to frighten you...
Everything'll work out.  Trust me on that.
Good night, beautiful.
Careful, Chief.  I don't think you know who I am.
Sorry.
Tell me!
Why didn't you tell me?
Oh, c'mon, would you stop, please?
Sorry, I'm working now.  You see, I have a job...
Then why were you at her house?!  She didn't want anything to do with you.
My God...you are one sorry son-of-a- bitch.
She did have a miscarriage, didn't she?  Didn't she?!
Ten dollars! Hell, I can't do that to you -- you can have her for a pizza.
Really?
What? Don't be a lightweight...this is top dollar toot.
I think I'll pass. See you later, okay?
What's wrong?
What murders?
Tell me.
And you'll never do it again.
What's that?
Dear Christ...
They're out of town.
He's doing the best he can, Charles.
What did you do with Rennie??
There must be a phone around here somewhere.
You're telling a lie.
But Sean said...
I...I can't...
I'm glad you decided to come after all.
Me too. But I'm not sure Uncle Charles will be.
It's not that simple.
I...I don't know...
I've got the numbers.
Rennie...
Rule one, don't panic. Rule two, assess the damage and act accordingly...
I used to drive a taxi.
I opened thousands of brains.
What did you find?
I was barrister in Kenya. I said to him, get off from here. I cannot drive with your body on my windscreen.
Shut up, Elliot.
She wants a divorce.
It's over, finished and done with.
But didn't we know it would happen?
I can tell you the year, the day, the night, the minute.
It's just a review.
You say we go?
We were thinking of putting in a pool.
Great game.
What are we talking about?
Let's work on it.
This could Pbe it.
This could be it.
Last night. Alan Albright called me a handsome woman. Second time he's done that. Son of a bitch.
What about her?
Peter Redmond. They found out why he can't remember his lines. There's something living in his brain. A parasite he picked up in Borneo, doing the movie.
It's your best play, Nicky.
That's completely crazy.
Oh please. Not now.  She wants you to stop seeing What's- Her-Name. Finally. Now and forever. Do you think that's too much to ask? For a wife of nineteen years.
She is kicking you out.
Don't call her Mother all the time. It makes her sound tragic and unforgiving. What happened to Mom?
And you blame me. It's because we never talk. Let's talk.
I had an affair -- are you sure you want to hear this?
People are dependable.
I'm at the door.
Go way. I'll call a cop.
Across Ninth Avenue. Dodgie's. Where you've been getting your hair cut for fifty years. Where Uncle Billy and Uncle Marty got their hair cut. Where Jim Rorty shot a man for cheating at poker.
Five's not so many. There were families with seven kids. A grandmother. A dimwit uncle.
Everybody else does. Why not you?
It's the kid's lucky day.
This is one charming crook. If shooting people is charming.
You see what you're doing, don't you?
Wife and daughter. My father's still alive. He outlives me, starting tonight. Because the Mets just tied the score. It was only a matter of time, wasn't it?
I want to believe.
All the times I died when the Red Sox lost an important game they should have won. All the awful things I said to my mother and father. To Tmy wife and daughter.
Don't worry. It's a test.
I have excellent long-term memory.
Yes, Peter.
But my parasite is consuming all the new memories. Eating my lines.
I kissed her while she was laughing.
You've worked with Elliot?
I hear good things about the new play.
He wears a disguise.
But you're his friend.
Stay. Teach me to be compassionate.
"Take a sixth step, that we may follow our vows in life."
What do you expect when you talk like that?
I'm sorry.
I thought you were a man of God.
Not quite. They're only "holding me" until the Magistrate's hearing. Then it will be prison.
If I want to be one with them, I have to live like them.
They're calling you "Bapu." I thought it meant father.
A -- a week.
Fortunately such news comes very slowly where I live.
If we obtain our freedom by murder and bloodshed I want no part of it.
What do you want?
Is it over if they arrest you now?
I would rather march.
We hope you intend to join us in the struggle for Home Rule, Mr. Gandhi.
Oh, yes, you are. It's been two hundred years since an Indian has cocked a snoot at the British Empire and got away with it. And stop calling me Mr. Patel, you're not a junior clerk anymore.
Allah be praised. And what battalions will you call upon?
And that's the basis of this "Declaration of Independence"?
He was right. It's insane -- anything would have been better.
It's for the best.
A man's dead, Detective.
Who knows with these "deficients"?  His profile indicates a proclivity for violence.
--I've already run it.  There's no record of any living relative.
We're already getting complaints about frivolous search.
A customer?  Does this Michael's cater to misfits?
What a relief.
Thank you, no.
It's about the Director.
Okay, how tall did you <i>used</i> to be?
Six one.
I think I'd better choose the menu.  After all, you're learning how to be me, I'm not learning how to be <i>you</i>.
Suit yourself.
Leave?  Just a few million years ago every atom in this hair--in our bodies--was a part of a star. I don't see it as leaving.  I see it as going home.
The Mission Director.
You wish.
And drinking it.  It's like Evian by the time it's filtered.
Any particular reason?
What are you talking about?
Come on--we're taking off.
--You don't understand, they'll make the connection, they'll hoover again.  We should cut our losses.
Again?
Will you be okay?

I'm sorry.  I didn't mean anything.
Where?
You're angry--
You'll be next.
Let's walk.
My medication.  I left it back there.
What happened?
But "if it came to it" then it couldn't have your--  --nose.  How perfect does your child have to be?
What is it?
Just remember, Lamar, I could have gone up and back and nobody would have been the wiser--
What about your wife?
That's your problem.
A little more was taken out before.  My brother's a director of that Bank, Mr. McCoy... I had a few pressing debts.
That Beynon's got a long arm.
Couldn't handle it then. Now I can.
I guess I'm kind of...
It's all right.
Wait... give me a minute.
Is he straight?
Usually on the right side as you go in.
Why?
I don't want to go there.
When I got out, why didn't you tell me where it was?
Maybe we should split up... I'll cut the money with you.
You've got all the answers. What about when they find the body on the train?
No... there's a couple of things I'm still working on.
Maybe. At least I got to him.  Where do we go from here?
I always thought jails make people hard. Not you. You're just not tough enough to forget about Beynon. I chose you, not him.
You and me.
Are we going to make it?
Me, neither. There's about twelve people in the state that aren't Mormons and I'm one of them.
You were with him?
My lady'11 come in in about five minutes. Have some food sent up in half an hour.
Where we go in1?
Listen... how much money did you make this year?
You serious?
That's what I want.
That right?
You can trust him...
The glucose will begin working in half an hour. You'll feel better then...
No choice. I had a visit from somebody.
You knew what I'd do.
Kinnear. Cyril Kinnear.  Kinnear did it.
Why?
Good evening.
No, don't Jack, don't.
Address?
What about?
What do you mean? You've been Frank's bird ever since her mother cleared off. You're closer to her than anyone.
I want to talk to you later.
He was all right to me.
He came to see Mr Kinnear.
We went about together.
No. I didn't know that.
He must have been pretty sure I'd come.
Who's setting you up in this place?
You've been watching the film.
Tell me about the girl.
What girl?
Was it Albert?
Nice of you to come.
Oh, what you doing now?
Yeah.
What?
Come off it. Frank was... well... straight. He had no worries I know. Hell, we worked together every day for a year. It would have showed.
Where you off to?
Ah, Edna, come in. Join the tea set.
Ever been into an arcade there and put a penny in the slot machine?
Are you a traveller?
You don't look it.
Suppose you tell me what the bloody hell's going on. It's my house, you know.
Yes, Edna, and I must say you've been great about the ...
Now just a minute...
What'll they do to him?
That little shit!
What about Keith?
So shut up.
Did you sleep well?
Are you tired?
What, and get myself beaten up again?
Eric. Eric Paice.
Yes, I can see your problem, Mr Kinnear.
I have to. Things to see to.
You're not seeing me?
I'll see you, then.
You ever get 'em?
I, I...I...
Some contest board...
It's not.
That's thinking.  Now, he's got the leads, he goes in business for himself.  He's...that's what I... that's thinking! "Who?  Who's got a steady job, a couple bucks nobody's touched, who?"
So Graff buys a fucking list of nurses, one grand--if he paid two I'll eat my hat--four, five thousand nurses, and he's going wild...
Yes.  It is.  It is simple, and you know what the hard part is?
That's the God's truth.  And it gets me depressed.  I swear that it does.  At MY AGE.  To see a goddamn: "Somebody wins the Cadillac this month.  P.S. Two guys get fucked."
Huh.
You don't ax your sales force.
You build it!
When they...
Look look look look, when they build your business, then you can't fucking turn around, enslave them, treat them like children, fuck them up the ass, leave them to fend for themselves... no.  No.  You're absolutely right, and I want to tell you something.
Somebody...
Should do something to them.
Something.  To pay them back.  Someone, someone should hurt them. Murray and Mitch.
Someone should rob the office.
No, we're just...
As an idea.
That's right.  It's a crime.  It is a crime.  It's also very safe.
A job with Graff.
You have to steal the leads tonight?
That's right, the guys are moving them downtown.  After the thirtieth. Murray and Mitch.  After the contest.
Dave.
They're going to come to everyone.
...they take me, then.  They're going to ask me who were my accomplices.
That's right.
Hey, hey, let's just keep it simple, what I need is not the...what do you need...?
I, you know, they should be insured.
That's not...Fuck that shit, George. You're a, hey, you had a bad month. You're a good man, George.
I am?
He said we're all going to have to go talk to the guy.
Why don't you think so?
You understand?
Who used to say that?
What?
Levene!
Which, wait a second, which is not until the check is cashed.
I've...look.  Will someone get this guy off my back.
...you want to see the court records?  John?  Eh?  You want to go down...
You know what those leads cost?
Bullshit, bullshit, you assign them... What are you telling me?
Alright.
I'm asking you.  As a favor to me?  John.  John: my daughter...
That's alright.
How do you know I made it up?
I told the customer that his contracts had gone to the bank.
I don't know what you are saying.
How much did you get for them?  How much did you get for them?
No, I don't think so, Shel.
Only the beginning...
"...you have to believe in yourself..."
Shelly...!
Just now.
Fuck you, Dave...
Harriett...
You closed 'em today?
You're a client.  I just sold you five waterfront Glengarry Farms.  I rub my head, throw me the cue "Kenilworth."
Home...
What?
I'm sorry...?
What do I...?
Money?  If that's what it signifies to you. Security?  Comfort?  All it is is THINGS THAT HAPPEN TO YOU.  That's all it is.  How are they different?  Some poor newly married guy gets run down by a cab.  Some busboy wins the lottery.  All it is, it's a carnival.  What's special...what draws us?  We're all different.  We're not the same.  We are not the same.  Hmmm.  It's been a long day.  What are you drinking?
Gimlet.
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
No, I'm saying you don't include Saturday...in your three days. It's not a business day.
And when was that check cashed?
I don't know.
Tell me again.  Your wife.
I...
What...?  Say the words.
Let's...no one's going to know, let's go around the corner and we'll get a drink.
You cashed the check?
Cop couldn't find his dick two hands and a map.  Anyone talks to this guy's an asshole...
You going to turn State's?
You just this morning...
We haven't got a lead...
What is this, your farewell speech?
I'm going home.
...you want to go out today...?
Patel?  Ravidam Patel?  How am I going to make a living on thses deadbeat wogs?  Where did you get this, from the morgue?
Are you alright?
Did you see my present for you?
Will you take me?
To do business.
You've grown so tall... so tall in the last year.  You're much taller than me.
I'm not hungry.
Fanucci is not connected; he is alone.
What took so long?
 You know his friends...real animals. And his connections with the police. Sure he'd like us to tell him our plans so he can set us up for the cops and earn their gratitude. Then they would owe him a favor; that's how he operates.  We'll have to pay.  Three hundred, are we agreed?
Yes, thank you.
Well, thank you, they asked for you all week.
I saw him with you.
The ink on your divorce isn't dry. Your children see you on weekends; your oldest boy, Michael Francis... was in some trouble with the Reno police over some petty theft that you don't even know about.
Michael, Fredo's in the house with Mama.  He asked for you, and Tom said he couldn't see you.
Tom is right.
I just had a drive; besides, I want to see my brother-in-law Michael.
I hate to see you cringe in front of him.  How come you're so scared of your own kid brother?
Whatsamatter, you don't want me to dance with him 'cause he's a man!
Deanna, will you get back into the house!
You tell your friends I expect them to let me wet my beak in the same manner.  Don't be afraid to tell them.  Clemenza and I know each other well, he understands these things.  Let yourself be guided by him.  He has more experience in these matters.
We have a special home for you for the rest of your life.  Nobody gets near you.  You're not going any place.
Why'd you do it, Frankie?  After all these years, why'd you turn against him?
Ready, Frankie.
Oh.  Mikey, what's up?  I'm totally in the dark.
Jeeze, it's great you came along, Mike... You know, we've never spent a night out on the town together. I always thought you looked down on me for liking a good time.
The song.  Are you sincere with me, Fredo?
Mike, are you crazy, I'm your brother.
To go tonight, with me, as though we know nothing.  I've already made my move.
We have time.
I know what you are thinking, Vitone, but you don't understand yet how things are.  Fanucci is of the Black Hand.  Everyone in the neighborhood pays him, even my father.
Why?
 And he agreed?
If you told Michael what I've told you today, I'm a dead man.
But if you're wrong...
Did the boy get something from me for Christmas?
I want you to reach Fredo.  I know he's scared, but have one of our people reach him.  Assure him that there will be no reprisals.  Tell him that I know Roth misled him.
Does she blame it on me?  The baby?
I don't like it when you use the word impossible; nothing is impossible...
Al, as far as you're concerned, I'm the Don.
Did my brother go back?
You're right.
No strings.
Do you owe markers?
Sir, the gentleman does not understand English.  He would not in any case, take the stand.  He came, at his own expense, to aid his brother in his trouble.  He is not under any jurisdiction of our government and his reputation in his own country is impeccable.
Whose orders are these?
I had no idea...
Why don't you sit down?
Not for a few years.
However I can help you...
We're making a big investment in Cuba.  That's my only concern.
I know it wasn't me...so that leaves you.
The hotel's registered owners are one Jacob Lawrence, and Sidney Barclay, both Beverly Hills attorneys.  In reality it's split between the Old Lakeville Road Group from Cleveland, and our friend in Miami.  He takes care of others outside the country, you know who I mean.  Meyer Klingman runs the store, and does all right, but I've been instructed to tell you, that if you move him out, our friend in Miami will go along with you.
No.
I know.
No.  There are things that I have planned with Hyman Roth.  I don't want them disturbed.
Don Corleone, I wish you let me know you was coming.  We could have prepared something for you.
I want you to settle these troubles with the Rosato Brothers.
I want you to settle on their terms.
Jesus Christ, Michael, then let's hit 'em now, while we still got the muscle.
We could have talked first, saved a lot of running around.
What if I say shove it?
We got no choice.
I've already rented it; I cannot disappoint the new tenants.  They're paying a higher rent.
How much more a month?
Your good heart in helping the poor widow has shamed me, and I want to show that I, too, have some Christian charity.  Her rent will remain what it was.
I accept your generosity...
I say let loverboy watch his movie.  And be grateful Boone's not cutting Shirley Temple's lawn.
Yeah, well keep your filthy thoughts to yourself.
Fuck you.
This looks corny.
Maybe it's supposed to be funny.
What's to be jealous of?
What's that mean?
I wasn't going to try anything.
No.  No.  I am sorry.  Forget everything I say.  Here.  I will take the tray.
I'm not married.
Why?
You're telling me Mr. Whale is a homo.
You and he are not doing things?
Mornin'.
And your name is --?
Boone.  Clayton Boone.
Everything alright, Mr. Boone?
No.  Iced tea's fine.
You know what they say.  If you have to ask --
They're just copies then.  Gotcha.
Still.  You must be rich.  Making a couple of famous movies like those.
I returned recently from a stay in hospital.
Huh?
But expressively broken.  How did it happen?
Just a year.  I dropped out to join the Marines.
Did you see this?  They're showing one of your movies tomorrow night.
You don't say?  Which picture?
All right, I guess.
I don't like to talk about that.
Oh dear.  If one must have a clinical name.
You know how it is.  You have to kiss ass just to get a piece of it.
You've done a helluva lot more than most people.
Of course, they weren't nearly as bashful.  No, this room was once filled with bare buttocks.  And pricks.  Hard, arrogant pricks --
You were a soldier?
You don't want to wait it out? Rain should let up soon.
Ten minutes ago.  Didn't you hear me calling?
Storm's getting worse.
I don't recall.  Memories of the war, perhaps.
No.  It won't do.
Please, Clayton.  Just for a minute.  Long enough for me to see the effect.
I haven't done a damn thing with you!
Did I hurt you?
Nothing I didn't deserve.
Hey, Boone.
Where's Betty?
I did.  But Princess Margaret was a doll.  We're all equals in her eyes.  As commoners, I presume.
You only embarrass yourself.
You know what I mean.  Your reputation.
Well the rest of us aren't.  Can't you remember that?
Yes, yes, Dr. Payne.  But from the neck up?  What's my story there?
I saw Una O'Conner a few weeks ago. She said you'd been under the weather.
He looks plenty big.  You won't need my help if anything goes flooey.
I'll be fine, Hanna.  Thank you.
That's my favorite line in my favorite movie of yours.  "Bride of Frankenstein."
I don't mind.
Of course.
Okay.  "Frankenstein."  Tell me everything.
Universal wanted me for another story, and wanted me so baldly -- I mean badly, not baldly.  I was given the pick of stories being developed, and I picked that one.
Who came up with the Monster's makeup and look?
You didn't?
I'm the one who got you on Mr. Cukor's guest list.
Oh dear.  Have I made a blunder?
What about?
A boost. A big boost ...
Maybe she don't know. Although I don't see how that could be. Maybe she didn't want to upset you -
Also, never underestimate the restorative powers of "Karaoke."
Speak for yourself, boss I don't have a Hollandaise sauce
I'm just here about my brother.
This is how you're spending my time? Having a sock hop?
How's that?
Kip.
And this has what to do with me?
You're thinking: okay, there's no want ... But they probably stripped its guts and crated 'em up, right ... ?
No faith in our new-found goodness, Detective ...?
Where you been, anyway?
How'd it go?
I guess ...
Very good. Think you can get in without waking her up -- ?
You mean the poor --
Donny --
What about him?
Most of 'em are late-model...
The corner of Hawthorne and Granvia. Tumbler messed up. He said the Lotus would be at the corner of Hawthorne and Granvia --
That can't be it. Cos we don't need saving
What are you doing back?
oh.
And just in case you lose your keys, good sir, I can toss in a complimentary slim-jim, free of charge ...
I remember. Supper getting cold, cos you two are out there heads under hoods ...
D.W.P. Thanks for holding. How can I help you?
Okay, then ... I just go to the Marriott and I'm set ...
You boosted a 'Vette? Then where is it?
Yeah ...
He's gonna kill you -- !
I can handle it --
You can handle it?
I can handle it --
After a while, it became a little pathetic ... Figured I'd put you out of your misery ...
What about just getting a job, 9 to 5, five days a week, that whole mystery achievement -- ?
Nah.
That's strange. I'm nervous. Donny's nervous. Everyone's nervous. But not you...
But don't worry, man. Things are all sweetness and light here...
Call 'em here -- ?
On account of Mitch?
Ready -- ?
Slip it in ...
I pop your hood; find your siren wires
Wrong preposition...
Where to -- ?
I can't. I got a back load of repairs and one of the mechanics called in sick and I haven't slept and--  Where to -- ?
Hello, Otto ...
The chop-shop... Where are the stripped cars?  The rolled-back odometers? The part bins?
Tell me...
It can be done. Take two days to shop; one to prep. I'll offer up my bible for a small fee. You also have to hope Kip's jerk-circus didn't undo Castlebeck's linkage so much so that he's setting up surveillance teams on every city block. And then get yourself a crew...
Sure. Hey, Toby. You grew up
This Eleanor's been living at the International Towers for 3 years now.
So she flies -
How come ... ?
Look at Jeannie's kid.
The oldest one.  He was in an argument. A lousy ten-dollar card game. The kid pulls out a gun. It goes off. The kid gets killed. The grandmother hears it and finds out he's been arrested. She has a heart attack.  She drops dead right on the spot. Now Jeannie's got a husband and son in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.
Billy, how are you?
No. The other one. The one who disappeared up the block from Christie. The one they made a beef on.
Nods.
Anybody!  You understand?
I've been all fucked up since I got out.
Talk? To you? After what you did!
What're you doing? What about the car?
Jezuz Christ!
What are you talking about?
What about the schools?
You got money for your bullshit television, don't you?  I gotta watch you swimming back and forth on TV all night long, don't I? You got money for that, but you don't have my money?
If Paulie finds out, we got problems.
He was jumpy. He hadn't touched a thing. In the old days, Jimmy would have ordered doubles and eaten it all.  On the surface, of course, everything was supposed to be fine. We were supposed to be discussing my case, just like we always would, but I had a feeling Jimmy was trying to sense whether I was going to rat him out to save my neck.
Now this is important. Make sure you leave the house when you make the call. You understand? Do you hear me? It's important.  Call from an outside phone. I mean it.
Do you realize what we're involved in here now?
Tommy. He. doesn't mean anything. Forget about it.
Tommy.  Come on. Relax.
Don't start. I told you to clean up. Look at this place. It's a pigpen. Look around here. Why do you think I bought you the dishwasher? Look. Look at this.  There's enough powder around here to put us all away.
I gotta talk to him as soon as I can.
He's got your father upset. Good thing he doesn't have to go to work in the morning. Is this what he deserves?
Driving you crazy?  Don't get me started.  You're here a month and sometimes I know he doesn't come home at all. What kind of people are these?
I got dry cleaning.
I don't want them left back.
You?  You think you're the only one?  I've talked to them a million times, but they don't listen.
Paulie, I swear, I'm afraid. The guy's nuts. What do I have to do? Whatever I gotta do, I'll do.
You guys know my cousin Mikey Sullivan?
Well you know how he loves animals right? Anyway, last week he's drivin' home... 
What are we gonna do up there?
What?
She went to Medical school in California.
Oh I'm sure, that's why only one of us has herpes.
Yeah, sit in a room and do long division for the next fifty years.
Chuckie, what are you talkin'...
You don't know that.
Did she get my Double Burger?
What the fuck? I just asked you for a job yesterday!
Chuck, let's go.
What's up guys?
Hey, asshole. Happy Birthday.
Me and Bill scraped together the parts, worked on it. Morgan was out panhandlin' every day.
Good, it was all right.
Hey, come on pal we're in classes all day. That's one thing about Harvard never seizes to amaze me, everybody's talkin' about school all the time.
To tell you the truth, I wasn't there much. The class was rather elementary.
Codebreaking.
That's exactly right, Will. So the question as I see it isn't "why should you work for N.S.A." it's "why shouldn't you?"
Where is it touching you?
With a Ramses graph on the binary tree--
Excuse me. Is this the buildings and grounds office?
Hello. Gerald Lambeau, M.I.T.
Okay. How?
This is correct. I see you used Mclullen here--
That's fine, but did you ever think--
Will.
No. LAMBEAU Okay thank you, Timmy.
Why me?
Just meet with the boy once a week.
Would you excuse us?
That's great, Gerry, that there's interest-- But I'm not sure he's ready for that.
--Ready to falsify documents because you've given him license to walk away from this.
Oh, come on, Sean--
If you push him into something, if you ride him--
You're wrong, Sean. I'm where I am today because I was pushed. And because I learned to push myself!
I don't know... Gotta be at least four to one.
Will, your not getting off that easy.
What?
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm married and I have two children.
Have you read all these books, Will?
You think so?
Nautilus?
Tell me what you really think.
You've never been on a plane.
Jesus Christ, you are an amateur.
You don't regret meetin' your wife?
So wait a minute. The Red Sox haven't won a World Series since nineteen eighteen, you slept out for tickets, games gonna start in twenty minutes, in walks a girl you never seen before, and you give your ticket away?
They could see that I meant it.
Would have been nice to catch that game though.
I guess.
What?
Someone who challenges you in every way. Who takes you places, opens things up for you. A soul-mate.
It's not about that job. I'm not saying you should work for the government. But, you could do anything you want. And there are people who work their whole lives layin' brick so their kids have a chance at the kind of opportunity you have. What do you want to do?
You want to read it?
It's not your fault.
I know.
That's what you want?
I'm sorry, I don't recall meeting anyone who fits that description.
Okay, you got me. It's the ugly, obnoxious, toothless loser who got drunk and wouldn't leave you alone all night.
I don't know, it was just kind of the boring suburban thing. Private school, Harvard, and now Med. School.  I actually figured out that at the end of it, my brain will be worth a quarter of a million dollars. I shouldn't have told you that...
No I haven't...
Well, Irish Catholic. What do you think?
Marky, Ricky, Danny, Terry, Mikey, Davey, Timmy, Tommy, Joey, Robby, Johnny, and Brian.
Sorry. I'm sorry. Give me another crack at it. Let me take you out.
Promise?
Is it me you're hiding from them or the other way around?
You're rich. What do you have to worry about?
All right, Mr. Nosey Parker. Let me ask you a question? Do you have a photographic memory?
Nobody does organic chemistry for "fun." It's unnecessary. Especially for someone like you.
What?
Don't bullshit me! Don't fuckin' bullshit me!
Twenty days work, oh boy!
But ain't no reason--
Whatsa matter, Ma? Gettin' scared?
So long.
Two.
Two.
Why, I guess so.
Two and a half cents.
Take it or leave it. There's 200 men coming from the South that'll be glad to get it.
Camp site costs a dollar a week, but you can work it out, carrying garbage, keeping the camp clean--stuff like that.
We'll work it out. What's this committee you talkin' about?
Say, who runs this place?
Why ain't they more like it?
Anything like work aroun' here?
Can't promise you that, but there'll be a licensed agent here tomorrow mornin', if you want to talk to him.
But you wasn't a preacher. A girl was just a girl to you. But to me they was holy vessels. I was savin' their souls.  I ast myself--what *is* this call, the Holy Sperit? Maybe *that's* love. Why, I love everybody so much I'm fit to bust sometimes!  So maybe there ain't no sin an' there ain't no virtue. There's just what people do. Some things folks do is nice, and some ain't so nice. But that's as far as any man's got a right to say.
Maybe Ma'll have pork for supper. I ain't had pork but four times in four years--every Christmas.
I aim to.
I'll tell 'em. But I don't know how. Never seen so many guys with guns. Wouldn't even let us talk today.
I guess that's right. Have to take a beatin' before he'll know.
Seems like we wasn't never gonna do nothin' but move. I'm so tar'd.
You know what I mean. You been givin' me a goin' over ever since I got in. Whyn't you go on and ask me where I been?
Me neither. I'm just tryin' to get along without shovin' anybody around, that's all.  See that road up ahead?
Crossin' the desert in a jalopy like this.
Well, maybe. But I'd hate to be doin' it. Takes more nerve than I got.
An' the nex' thing you know you'll be out, because they got it all figgered down to a T--until the harvest is in you're a *migrant* worker--afterwards, just a bum.
Got any plants?
No plants.
Not tonight you can't. Want to walk back?--or you want me to whistle up some help and take you back?
Maybe Connie went to get some books to study up with. He's gonna be a radio expert, ya know. Maybe he figgered to suprise us.
Why, sure. It won't be so bad once we get her washed out.
Al ain't a-goin' away, an' you gonna *tell* him he ain't a-goin' away.  An' if you think diff'unt, you gotta whup me first. So some on.
That!
Muley tol' me what happened, Ma. Are we goin' to California true?
Sometimes they do.
Was Granma bad?
They know what--this fella looks like?
It's awright, Tommy. I wisht you didn't do it, but you done what you had to do. I can't read no fault in you.
What is it?
I know you would, Ma. But I ain't gonna let you. You hide somebody that's kilt a man an'... an' you'd be in trouble too.
You know what I been thinkin' about, Ma? About Casy. About what he said, what he done, an' about how he died. An' I remember all of it.
I been thinkin' about us, too--about our people livin' like pigs, an' good rich lan' layin' fallow, or maybe one fella with a million acres, while a hundred thousan' farmers is starvin'. An' I been wonderin' if all our folks got together an' yelled--
This ain't a groc'ry store. We got bread to make san'widges with.
Muley! Where's my folks, Muley?
Well?
But we couldn't *do* on any less'n what our share is now.  The chillun ain't gettin' enough to eat as it is, and they're so ragged we'd be shamed if ever'body else's chillun wasn't the same way.
Here we go!
Ya know, you're the second fella talked like that. I'd like to hear some more about that.
But what about this?
Come on. Ain't nobody gonna say anything.
I never knowed it! All I done was pull that string!
Morning.
He gets this way when he hits over eighty-five.
Insane.
I just play my own collection.
Where have I been?
What's that?
It's a swift spiritual kick to the head that alters your reality forever.
Unbelievable.
...Let me get my coat.
I think they'll probably have booze there.
Shoulda brought my gun.
Soft. I'll take the junkie otter, clearly! I'd let the little beast scratch and claw all he wants... Okay. Would you rather make love to the candied corpse of Phyllis Diller--
Get the fuck outta here.
You never could have kept this from me.
That's probably a good idea.
I'm staying here.
I have no illusions about the future. What is, is. We make choices. And we become the sum total of our choices. I can live with that.
What else? Say more.
Well?
Looks like someone keeps trying to do our job for us.
If he does our job, he's our job.
This?
Good. What else? Anything interesting?
I bought a new rug.
It's a place where religious people--
No, I don't have one.
Paul?
Kind of crept up on you, didn't it?
Yeah, but it's still kind of eerie, isn't it?
What the hell happened to you?
To shoot you. Correct.
Good evening, Mr. Newberry.
How's that?
I visualized you, in a haze, as one of the slackster, flannel-wearing, coffeehouse-misanthropes I've been seeing in Newsweek.
I took the other road. I'm more of a self-reflective young lion who does business with lead-pipe cruelty and goes home to drink light beer in milky-eyes isolation. I love sports and sex and have no real relationships with anyone. And you?
I'm a professional killer.
I'll pay you for your fare. I'll send you to Montana first class.
You know, we're branding here tomorrow. If you two want to come by to watch or give a hand, you're welcome.
Ha... if you've never lived in a city with museums, theater, music, restaurants, uh... god, a million things, then it's something I can't explain.
You sleeping all right in that house?
Well, he don't know that. Just sit the horse.  Good... You have a nice seat.
Ever think of moving there full time?
I am comfortable.
Oh, God, what are we going to do? I'm supposed to --
Why don't you go lie down?
I can't find that charm Daddy gave me from India.
No, I don't mean you have to. It's just that we may not have enough --
-- enough time tomorrow. I know.
Don't they believe in signs here?
We'll have more room because we're moving onto the ranch. They have this empty house near this creek. It's actually pretty... OK... I love you.  Dad wants to talk to you.
Well...  So you tried riding again?
Look, I just wanted to say, I think it's great you're riding again. And... and I think I know why you, you needed to do it alone... without anyone knowing...
Who's going to want me now?
David?
What did he say?
Did you get a hold of that horse guy?
What was I saying?
No. I was just researching. Calm down.
Why?!
You know, I just asked that myself tonight. He doesn't know.
You're allergic to hay.
I apologize for the surprise, but the days only opened yesterday and I figured...
Are you going to stay in the city or go up to Connecticut?
I'll tell you something, Annie -- I stood there looking at what was happening to that horse... And, I swear, it felt like the same thing was happening to me.
I don't understa-
What choice!!?
I'll help you with the coffee.
I'd love to go there one time...
I fell in love. After that, I never thought about being anything but a rancher's wife. I never saw it like I was losing some other life, just felt like I was gaining one. I know that's not a popular opinion nowadays and I ain't saying it's the right one. We all have to find the life meant for us.
Yes, but he's in a tremendous pain...
Annie, no matter what I do, this horse will never be the same.
Of course not.
Sure. As long as she don't mind.
Now son, you tell 'em when it came from.
Yeah?
Put the key in and turn it.  The right pedal is gas, the other one's the brake.
I don't know if I can.
...Oh, come on! You think the same thing!
If it's not too much trouble, I thought I might.
Long enough.
I'm sorry, sir. We caught him by surprise, so we don't think he had time to erase his computer files.
Oh yeah? What's that?
Maybe. But, if I were gonna hack some heavy metal, I'd, uh, work my way back through some low security, and try the back door.
Shh!
What?
Uh... Nikon, can I... can I crash at your place tonight?
Very impressive.
What are you, stoned or stupid? You don't hack a bank across state lines from your house, you'll get nailed by the FBI. Where are your brains, in your ass? Don't you know anything?
Due to Mr. Gill's untimely demise and everything, I guess you two will have to improvise the next round.
What are you doing?
I'm taking over a TV network.
Can I cut the electricity to his room so he'll sleep normal hours? He's been playing with his computer all night for a solid week.  Well yes, he could be playing with himself. Mmm hmm. Yes I'll ask. Dade, you like girls, don't you?
What did we learn in school today?
That's bullshit.
You lay a finger on her and I'll kill you.
Crash Override.
How did you know that?
Two days.
Here's your class.
What?
What the hell are you doing?
P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.
If I win, you become my slave.
We need your help.
And no one's caught it because the money isn't really gone. It's just data being shifted around.
This Ellingson security creep. I gave him a copy of the disc you gave me.
I can't believe they decided you won.
Norman? This is Mr. Eddie Vedder, from Accounting. I just had a power surge here at home that wiped out a file I was working on. Listen, I'm in big trouble, do you know anything about computers?
It's a little boxy thing, Norm, with switches on it... lets my computer talk to the one there...
Yeah, I'm sorry, I was just looking for the principal's office.
Did you find the program for the virus on any of the discs we confiscated?
The System Command Processor, it's the brain.
Joey, Joey...
Once again, don't call me Eugene.  A recent unknown intruder penetrated, using a superuser acount, giving him access to our whole system.
The FBI computer holds files on twenty million Americans.  I just hacked into it.
Hello, operator services.
You're late.
So I have to watch Jamie tonight.
This morning.
Well you found out this morning? Why didn't you tell me before? I mean it's 5 o'clock now Rachel...shit
Don't get angry.
Just leave me alone and lets forget it.
So you hop on to the next best thing? I thought you were different from other guys.
Is there another key?
Brady! Come with us.
Sometime in the night. They probably lost the road in the storm. Come down the embankment. It happens.
Mom, please
Well tonight is very important for your father and me.
We'll be at the Fallbrooks. The number's next to the phone.
Honey, I don't think their home.
We should call the fire department.
Why wasn't I notified?
I don't want to have anyone live through that night again.
Night Doc.
What the hell did this?
Got it Earl.
I wanna go trick-or-treating like the other kids.
Jamie, what happened?
No.
Don't you mean what you do best?
I don't want to look pushy.
Well I don't want to seem desperate or anything.
Well do I drop you off at the Discount Mart or the Dairy Queen?
Maybe you ought to wait here till they do.
Oh Christ. Doc...
Oh Christ. They wouldn't have given up without a fight.
Where's that Deputy?
These kids aren't likely to forget.
Sort of.
Your hunting it, ain't ya? Yeah, your hunting it all right, just like me.
All right Rachel, you stay by this radio. The state boys will send word once their in route. When that word comes you go tell deputy Logan.
Why didn't you wait for me?
Come on, Annie. Bob and I have been planning on it all week.
What time?
Saving the treats for Bob?
I'm never smiling again. Paul dragged me into the boys' locker room to tell me...
Look where?
I had my mouth full. Couldn't you hear me?
Now you hear obscene chewing. You're losing it, Laurie.
I hate that dog. I'm the only person in the world he doesn't like.
I can't help it. It just keeps ringing.
Want a beer?
Yeah, sure.
He was here, earlier tonight, and he may be coming back. I'm going to wait for him.
Sure...
It's totally insane! We have three new cheers to learn in the morning, the game in the afternoon, I get my hair done at five, and the dance is at eight. I'll be totally wiped out!
As usual, I don't have anything to do.
Sure.
Will you read to me? Can we make popcorn?
After the Jack-O-Lantern.
Now I want you to change your clothes, Tommy. We're going to take a walk outside.
Laurie, you come with us...
Now, I want you to walk to the door, down the stairs and right out the front door.
Will you get her for me?
You can get back on the telephone and tell them exactly what walked out of here last night. And tell them where he's going.
The only thin that ever bothers me is their jibberish. When they start raving on and on...
Uh, who gets dropped first?
...a monstrosity!  Who would do that?
Well...we have seen a lot of stuff today, though.
Gee, um...  I...I don't know what to say.
Is this your first job?
Yeah, we're the Stanislavski Catering Company.
Now I'm going to tell you the truth. I really came in here because I was bored stiff by the party.
We could...we could do that.
Y-you live in Chelsea, don't you?
Well, this guy's the real hypochondriac of the family.  I mean, he's, you know, he's--
I always, I-I always imagine that I have things.
Well, are...are they big?
Ed Smythe, yes.
Yes, but you name names.
Well, I'm-I'm looking for a bookstore.
Don't let me get started on my childhood.  Oh, you know what?  There is a bookstore.
Yes? LEE  A couple of blocks from here.  If you don't know about it, you should. You'd really love it.
No?
Uh, yes!
Oh, no, I can't let you get me that. That's too much.
Well, thanks a lot.
He's got like six gold records.
What are you doing?!
I, I must apologize.  I-I'm, I-I'm sorry.  I'm so mixed up.
But it hasn't been forever. 
God, Mickey's such a hypochondriac. I wonder how he'd handle it if there was ever anything really wrong with him?
You bet.
Was I?
Do you feel, um...are you disenchanted with our marriage?
What kind of interrogation... Su- supposing I said yes?  I-I-I am disenchanted.  I am in love with someone else.
I don't know about that.  Oh, no, I just, see, I-I've been very, very lucky.  W-when I had the kids, I decided to stop working and just, you know, devote myself to having the family, and I've been very, very happy  but...I've always secretly hoped that maybe some little gem would come along and tempt me back on the stage...
I want ice!  Who's got some--  Oh, there it is.
Oh, Mom!
But Catholicism?  Why not your own people?
Why should I be afraid?
Elliot lusts after you.
...or films you must see or... 
I don't sell my work by the yard!
What's the problem?
Why?
Oh, yes, you have!
It doesn't make a difference!  I have to move out!
Jesus...Jesus!
Naturally, I, I--Do you know I--The sudden appearance of a black spot on my back!
Hi.  She's auditioning for a television commercial.  She said she's gonna be a little late.
I hope you tell her it was your idea...
Oh, he's fine.  He's-he's, I guess he's fine.  I don't know.  He's been kinda moody lately, the last few months.
Oh, will you stop attacking Hannah?!
What's the matter?  What's the matter with you?  You look pale.  You okay?
Yeah?
Yeah, aren't you like, you know...
Huh?
I think so.
Oh!
Wow!
Um, I-I didn't really want to, you know, go to a sperm bank or something, have some anonymous donor.  I-I just, you know, I-I-I wouldn't want that.
You promised to stay on the wagon.
Someday, I'll pay it all back.
Doesn't she look great in that new dress?
He's the headmaster of Daisy's school.
I mean, y-you know, don't say it that way, you know, because my confidence is not my strong point, I--
Awwww...
I'm not!  I'm not!  I'm trying to be helpful.  A person doesn't just say one day, "Okay, now-now I'm finished as an actress.  Now I'm a writer."  I mean--
I'm-I'm always happy to help you financially.  I think I've gone out of my way to-to introduce you to interesting single men.  There's nothing I would--
Not when they're sung by extraterrestrials.
Oh, well, I cannot communicate with you!  I, you know, I never realized you were such a tightass. MICKEY I can't understand you.  Your sisters, both sisters have such good taste in music.  I don't know where you went, went wrong.
You know, it's probably my fault. I've been a little depressed lately.
Yes, you do recall, right?
I'd never do that.
...in a really horrible way.
I'm okay.
Oh, nothing much.  You know...
Oh...well, you-you're not interested in this.
What...what about your script?  So what's it about?
Yeah.
Oh, well.
It's great.  I swea-- I'm-- I'm, tch, I'm speechless.  I was...I was not in the mood to listen to this thing now.  I don't know what to say.  I'm moved and I laughed and I-- Uh, I, you know, I was on the edge of my seat.  I just think it's wonderful! I'm, I'm totally...stunned.  This is not an insult.  I'm amazed that you can...  It was-- I just thought it was great.
Do you?  I mean, are you, are you, are you, are you free this evening?
Now don't get nervous.  It's just your husband.
Oh, my God.  Thank you.
Dad...
Oh, please!  We all came to have lunch, didn't we?
You're afraid of dying? MICKEY  Well...yeah, naturally.  Aren't you? I-- L-let me ask you, reincarnation, does that mean my soul would pass to another human being, or would I come back as a moose or an aardvark or something?
...you don't have to think.
<u>What</u> is this, a whorehouse, or are you my <u>wife</u>?
...and I want to talk to you about your <u>promotion</u>..
Would you mind saying that into your bag...?
I'm struck by your phraseology.  I did not <u>last</u> with him.  I was privileged to enjoy his company during that time.
Say it in English.
Then who's buying it?
Oh, yes.  He's found Peace.
I know her by the Back.
Are you <u>alright</u>...?
How was America?
What else did I miss...?
Why did he come back?
HE TURNED BACK INTO THE ROOM.  Where have we Seen it Before.
Where was the call from.
...sir...?
He escaped...
It's not something he wants to publicize, Ma'am.  It's just something he does.
Now, why in the world would he do that?
Try Barney Clark.
No, no, of course not.
...Mr. Verger would be pleased to make a contribution, to the charitable...
...here's to child abuse!
Mmm...
...and then, he'll be coming down.
You said the <u>bad</u> news...
I can make you rich.
...fraid, that's about it, Doctor.
Starling...?
She was there, alone, sir, she was in a burning building, waiting for your folks to come through the wall.  And...
I don't <u>think</u> so...
I'm an orphan.
It gets, um... it gets so lonely sometime.
Give it up.
Sadly, no.  And I find that birth is one of the few things in life which study and a pleasant attitude can not amend. What do you think?
I have had many excellent meals there.
And you have a new wedding ring on yours? <u>La Vita Nuova</u>?-- 
Darling, Dr. Fell.  My wife Madame Pazzi.
Do you like it at your home, Franklin?
And, fine, alright, and fine... what are <u>you</u>doing, this whole time?
...may be the heat....
I'm going to cut you loose.  With all due respect, Doctor, if you fuck with me, I'll shoot you dead, do you understand...?  Do right and you'll live through this.
I hope you'll <u>find</u> it so.  Yes.  It's <u>good</u> to see you regaining your strength...
Freud, do you know...?  Freud psychoanalyzed patients in One Afternoon.
Would that add to your <u>mirth</u>?
You want another drink, honey...?
Yeah, well, they solved that:  turns out, he'uz a <u>cannibal</u>...
What do you want to do?  You want to jam up that sonofabitch Krendler.
...something about my <u>father</u>...?
...what...?
Yes, but the <u>important</u> thing, as I've said...
What shape is the scar?
What shape is the scar?
Or clear your windshield with it.
...what a lovely perfume.
....this is perhaps an inappropriate <u>time</u>... but, I would like to say, it is an honor to meet the Woman who <u>solved</u> the celebrated Hannibal Lechter...
And what does <u>that</u> mean?
Then, that being so, why is today special?  Why have you come back to see me?  Is it that new file they gave you?
...you called up memories of your <u>father</u> to...
What does <u>that</u> mean?
For approval.
And you have decided to accept... to accept this "emotion," as you put it, to the ... the "sweepings. of the Lechter case.
What is your point?
Yes.
For the <u>worst</u> hurt, of course, that which will not heal, is the conviction no one cares.
Sadist!  I can't believe I thought you could change--This is your idea of discipline?  You're a monster.  That kid is going to be traumatized for...
Yeah...Are we going to do it or what? I still haven't packed.
I'm gay. Like you didn't know.
Eavesdropping, eh?  Hear anything good?
There you are!  Man, I don't know how to thank...
Go stand by the flagpole.
Man asswipe, you made my enormous cock fall off...
Isn't this the time where one of us says something deeply offensive to the other one...We're just so different.
Nobody really changes at summer camp. They merely find out who they are and become it more than ever.  You can't be helped, Wichita. I'm not sure you can be punished, either. But let's find out...
What in the hell did you do that for?
Gosh, this is really a great conversation--I can't believe I said that out loud.
I missed you. I know I'm not as, as exciting as your other friends.
I'm sorry? I don't get it.
You don't have anything <u>for</u> her either. Come on, it'll be Very. The note'll give her shower nozzle masturbation material for weeks.
I'll think about it.
Sawyer. Guess what today is?
Crap. So who's this Brad guy I've been set up with? Witty and urbane pre-lawyer or albino accountant?
What's your damage? Brad says you're being a real cooze.
You stupid cunt!
What are you doing here?!
Grow up, Heather. Bulimia's so '86.
Anyway, I can say never to high school. I've got David.
Is she dead?
Just shut up and turn on the radio. Hot Probs is on.
Veronica! Color me stoked, girl. I've gotten <u>everyone</u> to sign this petition even the one who think BigFun are tuneless Eurofags. People love me!  My God, you haven't signed!
Chick-en.
We did a murder. In Ohio, that's a crime. But if this was like a suicide thing.....
This is the last thing she'll ever write. She'll want to cash in on as many fifty-cent words as poss.
Do you take German?
Oh.
Perrier water!
Oh come <u>on</u>. Lots of people drink Perrier. It's come a long way.
Did you miss him completely?
You can be so immature!
I'm going to make this Ms. Pauline thing work. Lines of communication between the cliques. You were a phase....
It's all over, J.D. Help me to stop it.
Veronica is into his act. No doubt.
Cool off, we're seniors.
Terrible thing. So will we get to meet this dark horse prom contender?
What's that?
I adore anything to do with the arts.
I've never cottoned on to Plasticine like you girls, but I enjoy making things out of wood.
Are you a carpenter, Mr. Rieper? HERBERT shakes his head.
This story of yours-maybe the school newspaper will print it when it's finished.
I've booked you in for a chest X-ray . . . just to be on the safe side.
Come on, sit up.
holds up a loaded fork. Pauline reluctantly takes it.
My name is Gina!
I'm educating myself!
snatches up an exercise book from a large pile.
What do you know? You wouldn't know the first thing about writing. You're the most ignorant person I've ever met!
You're rude . . . rude and insolent! I don't see why I should keep a horrid child like you at school a minute longer.
You're not going anywhere. You're 15 years old!!
Look, Mother!
I know it's hard for you being in here, but it is for the good of your health.
Hello!
It doesn't matter.
I shall call him Diello.
I can try my father's safe. I'm sure I can get the keys to his office.
What's happening to me? What are you doing?
That `poor me' attitude doesn't suit you Trevor. Listen, I don't mean to sound like Pollyanna but things could be worse. There's one good thing about coming so near to the end of ones life. Everything is new and exciting, like your seeing it for the first time. You might see things a litlle differently from now on.
Millions of people around the world get on busses every day. When was the last time you heard of anybody anywhere dying on a public transit bus?
Lucky for us these chairs happened to be here.
If it makes you feel better that took every ounce of self control I had. Trevor, I never date patients.
No you don't understand. That's why I've been fighting to get you better. So you wouldn't be a patient anymore.
Why didn't you tell me sooner? I would have switched doctors!
I have my connections
How much time off?
Twenty one. Why do we have to do this now Kirsty?
Shut up and play darling. Your turn.
Enjoyable too. The merger never even felt work for one second.
But you had more wisdom than to listen to a false prophet
And besides, I thought, to hell with it... it's okay if you only married me for my money.
The whackjob in the black lipstick who lives down the hall? She wanted you arrested for harassment. I told her to chill out and smoke a joint. I'd look the other way as long as she did you know?
Trevor barring the more outrageous aspects of your claim you are not the only widower the police have questioned when foul play is suspected.
Do you know where you are?
This game is over do you hear me?
I don't know what I'm doing here. I'm not even Catholic. I just had to tell somebody. It's like, ever since my wife died I don't know what I've actually done or what I've imagined. But I do know if one tenth of what's happening to me is reality... I've done some really awful things in my life. Things that I've... I guess I've blocked out...
Tawny? What's- what are you doing?
I don't recall saying I didn't want a million bucks...
Well, we gotta work this thing out, John.  It's a goddamn mess an' I'm halfway to doing serious time in the joint an' the TV lady's so stuck on you she don't want it to come out you stole her purse because it might break the heart of millions.  Looka those maniacs, willya?  They love you, for Chrissake!
It was you!  I thought I heard...
You got it?  Four year scholarship to a top college, plus Medical School or Law School or whatever Joey wants; pay off the $2,500 to my attorney, plus pay her fee in full, plus my annual consulting fee...
I think our best course right now would be to focus on the Probation Officer's report...
We can hope.  You still have your job, right?
Yeah, I been calling in sick.  They think I got the flu.
A son, yeah.  What about him?  Joey.
Hey, you could call me "Bernie," forget the "Mister LaPlante" stuff.  You are naive.
I seen on the TV where that do-gooder asshole's gonna go visit sick kids at three-thirty.  Children's Hospital, on the double.
Hey!  Do I have a record?  Have I ever done time?  I mean I been arrested a few times, who hasn't? Parking tickets for Chrissake! Suspicion of stuff!  Have I ever been convicted of anything?
Take a look at my employment record, you got my employment record there, right?  You see any unemployment there, any welfare? I'm a taxpayer.  They eat me alive, the tax people, they got taxes on everything, taxes, taxes, taxes, and forms!  Taxes and forms so I can pay your goddamn salary, so you can sit there and write stuff, guys like me pay your wages...
Do I hit anybody?  You see me shoot anybody?  Hey, drugs!  Do I sell drugs?  Jesus, I don't belong in prison.  I'm a family man.
Nope.  Legal problems, you gotta have a good attorney.
You gotta kid?  How old's your kid?
I didn't even know you had a kid.
What wouldja say if I toldja I ran into a burning plane an' saved a buncha people, Chick, an' risked my goddamnlife?
You mean like Bubber?  The hero?
If you're not in the car in ten seconds, I'll have the cops pick you up.
"Harassed."  Cause I yelled at him when he's riding in his limo?  The guy's a thief, he took my...
A lifetime of petty crime climaxed by your sleaziest accomplishment yet...  blackmailing a national hero...
Lie, you mean...
I snuck in.
Me?  Listen, I don't give no interviews.  That was John Bubber. You wanna ask me questions, you could talk to my attorney, Miss O'Day.
It was this war.  Viet Nam.  Doesn't matter.
What picture?
Here we are.  Yeah, that's a possibility.  A movie.  Now you gwan in, tell your mother I got you back on time.  Point that out to her. She was always on my case for stuff like that.  She's still like that, right?
Uh, no.  But I, uh, wonder if you could up support... support a program to help the needy and...
You were... very... inspiring.
Did you get it?  Jesus, did I say that?
We're gonna wait here?  The guy could be hours.
This guy LaPlante won an award?
He's gotta be a nut!  He saves all those people and swipes a <u>purse</u>?
You just can't bear the idea of good news.
You said all the passengers were accounted for...
She's flying to New York.  She's been nominated for a Silver Mike...
Does this mean I can stop worrying? Where'd we put him?
Upset!  What's he upset about?
He lost a shoe!
My God!  It... it <u>is</u> him!
Hi, Chief.  You like the suicide?
Don't be ridiculous.  I'm a reporter.
How are they with kids?
Okay.
Was that your dad?
I'm looking for some perfume.
Well, it's for a woman.
Actually, I have met someone. There's a woman I think I like.
That's terrific.  Don't be afraid to be demonstrative.  You're sounding a lot more confident than when we last spoke.
Right.
I apologize for that scene with my husband.  You must have overheard.
Yeah, I'm okay -- it's been a long night.
I was thinking about our conversation the other day -- what you said about choices.
Yeah, right -- I really have to go to bed.
I found a cent!
Hey.  Have a nice time -- it's a good school.
Baby, what is it?
A man?  Was it a dream?
Did Daddy tease you?
Why can't you just drive me to my old school every morning?
Thank God.
Stop knowing me so well.
Neil's still having a bad time at school.  I feel terrible seeing him so upset all the time.
I thought we'd be happy here.
I don't know -- put 'em in the drawer with all the Chinese take- away menus.
What -- what are you doing?
I think you should feel like dancing at a time like this.
Oh, honey.
What?
Shit!
Are we gonna buy this house?
What did the thermometer say?
A <u>man</u> started the fire.
That's right -- you got the bill this morning.  I put it on your desk.
What is it?
A tape from the surveillance camera at the First National Bank.  It was robbed this morning.
We sent the prints we lifted from the counter at the bank to the State computers, the FBI and interpol. Nothing.
You don't understand.  About seven years ago we found the body of a guy named Vasilnic in Jersey.  A week later in the parking lot of Madison Square Garden we found Iman Fasil. Three days after that Luman Castageer was found in an alley.  The fourth body we've never been able to identify.  All four men died from decapitation.  Nash was our primary suspect -- but he disappeared.
A few days ago.
Doesn't it scare you walk through the park at night?
Sing.
It is a beautiful day.  I am merely enjoying it.
I'm leaving.
And what do you think you will find in another land?
Maybe myself.
What are we doing here?
I'll go first.
How comes it your are not afraid?
I've come to strike a bargain with you.  I wish to learn the power of changing.
Sometimes.
I remember you.
Why do I feel that you know what's going on?
Where did you get it?
Do you always walk around with a sword?
New York is dangerous place.
Yes.
You have an interesting accent. Where are you from?
Because I don't feel like sitting in a rubber room for forty-eight hours.
Let me ask you something else.  At the excavation site in Scotland, the tunnel leading into the cavern had collapsed.  The day we found the body someone had moved the rocks, making a hole in the collapsed section.  What bothers me is that we found the rocks from the hole on our side of the tunnel wall.
Where will you go now?
Impressive -- is it not?  The problem is I can only keep the illusion for a few minutes.  I need more power to hold the form longer.  I need the Highlander.  Where is he?
You know it's not safe here for you.
Is there anything else you need?
I'm glad you've come home, Conner.
Don't cry, wee one.  It's a better place I go to.
I shouldn't have come back here.  It was a mistake.
Did they?  You are only a man, different than most -- but still a man.  You feel the same -- want the same.  You want to live.
Good afternoon...  ... Shirley.
Call the Palmdale City Attorney for a telephonic search warrant.  When you get the warrant, have Mikkelson and Dreyer search his house.
Wow.  Sure, right away, Chief.
You get anything on Smith?
Maybe Glen already picked up the disks.
Find out how we can hurt him.  By the end of the day, I want to own him.
Jesus.  What is this?
Everyone knows what we look like, Dennis. We won't be able to hide.
These bushes follow the wall into the neighbor's yard.  All we need is some kind of diversion and we're home free.
It's over.  We have to give up.
Then we might as well die rich.
You with the cops?
Talley?
I'm here.
I want a helicopter to take us to Mexico.
Okay.
Give up.
It ain't been a good day, Chief.
My father needs a doctor.  <u>Please</u>.
All you're doing is watching yourself on TV.  <u>Look</u> at him.
What about my father?
Aw, Jesus, not more of this.
It's a safety room.  If anyone breaks into your house, you can hide.
We can take it with us.
The cops are comin'!
Is Krupchek an aggressive guy?  Hot- tempered?  Anything like that?
You have his address?
Talley lives here.  I don't know if the place has security or not.
Are you out of your mind?
My wife and my daughter and the money. I'll bring the disks to the mall by the freeway, you bring my family.  We'll trade.
I gave the other one to the Sheriffs and they're giving it to the <u>real</u> FBI.  This one's a fake.
Don't worry about it.  How are you doing?
Mine, too.
We can use the crawlspace to get downstairs.  Then we can run for it.
Make the pizza.  I want scrambled eggs and hot dogs on mine.
He's just knocked out.  I've been knocked out.
Are civilians inside?
What are we going to do about Mike?
Just one question.  Please.
I'm Jeff Talley, the Bristo chief of police.  So far as we know, your children are okay.
Louise?
Louise?
Call Jane for me.  She's at the little Thai place.
I'm Talley.  Who's in charge?
Jesus.  He must've siphoned it from the cars.
No.  He said that his father's unconscious; he didn't say he was dying.
I'm looking for you.  I need your tactical unit.
Chief, Mikkelson.
What's my name?
What?
The doctors are taking care of him right now.  Thomas . . . are you safe?  Can you talk?
He has lots of disks.
I think he was working on them today, so they're probably in his office.  Could you find them and see who they belong to?
But I might be able to sneak into the office if they're not around.  Then I could open the disks here in my room.
I thought they locked you in your room.
Can you open them?
Are the disks still in your room?
Did you find the disks?
I have people in York Estates right under your nose.  If you do <u>anything</u> except what I'm telling you, you'll get Jane and Amanda back in the mail.  We clear on that?
We're almost home, you and me.  Keep your shit together.  This isn't L.A.
Paul, Paul, a moment please.
That's what I came to talk to you about.
Excuse me?
The Hutu-Tutsi thing. The BBC faxed to say they would be here on the sixth for the peace accords. And the U.N. wants the banquet room for that day, a reception to broadcast the signing ceremony. Can you organize monitors and check the satellite dish?
Name a price.
Don't be foolish. There's more money to be made here.
Do we know who fired the missile that killed the president?
You're fucking black! You're not even a nigger, you're African!  They're not staying to stop this thing. They're gonna fly right out of here with their people.
They fired a rocket at us.
That explains it. I'm sorry to tell you this but we've heard rumors the Militia are getting ready to storm the hotel.
What is it?
It's a single malt, Glenmorangie. I thought you'd like it. Anything you need, gentlemen, let me know.
As long as it is scotch.  Your white friends have abandoned you, Paul.
Satellites?
The Americans! Who are they to put us on trial. Let us imagine Paul when their president Kennedy was shot, they said it was a black man. Then their politicians, their radio stations gave orders â€˜we must wipe out these black people before they wipe out us.â€ What do you think would have happened? No different.
The police are very busy.
You said you had no whiskey.
You have cockroaches dancing on tables and you tell me the cellar is empty? Did they drink my whiskey?
Ishca Baha - the water of life. I went on a tour once of the finest single malt distillery in the world. Have you ever been to Scotland?
No, sir.
Wonderful country, wonderful golf. I wonder - will I ever go back? What do you think?
You are a marked man.
Go! What the fuck sort of journalists are we, running from a war? I'm ashamed. Are you? Well, are ya'?
I don't have to listen to you anymore.
Are you sure this is the river road?
I would never do that.
This is a Rolex, I can't take it.
Rusesabagina. Paul Rusesabagina.
Show us the manager. He wears a suit.
No, it is impossible. That side of town has been destroyed in the fighting. The children are dead.
Pack the bags, we have to move.
He wants your wisdom.
The president has been murdered.
Send them home. We are not the police. What do we have to protect them?
Listen to me woman. I said all the whites are leaving. The French, the Italians, even the Belgian UN soldiers.
What for Paul.
Tell me what it was.
Can I have your name again?
How much beer?
Out? Where are you going?
Moses, Moses Seradungu.
Not too big on it myself -- but then again, not on marriage either.
Easy. You've got to keep still for a bit, the last thing we need is a coronary.
"But you didn't, Ma'am. We have all these witnesses that saw..." well, whoever it ends up being that finally shoots him --
It's complicated. But don't worry --
Why in God's name wasn't this thing removed years ago??
Oh, for chrissake --
Don't think it'll be a problem.
-- what was he doing here?
A cleaning crew's supposed to arrive at 9:30 tomorrow morning -- I think the power of the house fades at dawn.
-- well, let's hear it for small miracles --
What's in there?
What's down there?
Right here, Mr. Pritchett. As well as five other bona fide, bank drafts for one million dollars each. Made out to cash.
You hear somebody?
You okay?
You shouldn't be -- you were nearly just killed, sweetheart.  And now that our birthday girl is finally here, let the games begin!
Could we have a word?
I gave you a goddamn guest list two pages long -- where the hell are they?
Then who are they?
Finding ways for me to die at these things is really your deal, isn't it? The "O.J." knife with the not-quite- retractable blade? Your "Jim Jones Kool- Aid" that was exactly that?
You're hurting me.
Huh. And here I had a completely different theory.
Oh, no-no-no -- much more bang for everyone's buck to nail the bitch --
Asking the wrong person again.
If I had one, Evelyn, I think you know who'd be first and last --
Jesus!
I don't know, Ms. Jenzen.
-- well, here's a better one: you're fired.
Do something!
I'm ready now.
I think...I may have the answer.
House 2, Guests 0.
Yeah. Why's there five checks? There's only four of us.
If you've got a gun on you, Price, I'd hand it over now.
Fascinated.
Well, I don't.
Then just wait -- maybe this whoever's got you next on the Asylum's equipment- test list. Maybe a literal mind-blow inside the "Saturation Chamber."
Don't think so. Stay the fuck back.
Problem where? Looked good to me.
It works.
But the million bucks each, that's for real?
Oh, no.
Believe me, we need to.
You coming, or are you waiting for Blackburn?
For the love of God....please...?
So many unanswered questions.  Why was she buried there.  And who killed her?
It looks delicious...
Can we leave out a bowl of milk, mommy?
Don't play games with me, little girl.
What about all my other stuff?
She's down.  Help her...
Did you grow up in Ireland mister?
We're here Aubrey!  Look, don't be afraid.  We want you to come back to us...
Oh my God!  She's in there!
Mommy!
Will, maybe we should have separate bedrooms for a while.
Well maybe we don't need to remind her of it.  She has a lot more to adjust to...new friends, new schools...it would be good if she had a stable family environment.
There's got to be an explanation. It could be a magnetic flux or something, maybe the power lines are giving off something.  Who knows?  I don't know, I think it's kind of interesting.
I don't know.  Someone who...knows about this kind of stuff.
Just because I have an open mind doesn't mean I'm going to pay some snake oil peddler to come in and shake a voodoo stick around the house.
It just disappeared.  Literally.
You know, I was thinking... All that stuff father Seamus said...about discord, distrust... we're doing all right, aren't we?  You don't have any doubts about me, do you?
What?
Maura, what is this!
You're bleeding.
We're usually successful in detecting the source of most problems.  Unfortunately.
We usually find nothing.  We've debunked many a reported haunting. About ninety five percent of the cases had some technical explanation.
Where is your daughter?  She might be able to give us some information.
Oh, that's nice...
Concentrate!  She can hear you!
What was she afraid of?
I don't know what happened... and I don't know what you did...
What's going to happen?
Take care of the girl.  Take care of your family.  They are important.
What do you mean?
Joey ....  Look, you wanna ride?  I can go by your place.
And what is ... this frozen moment?
Because - monster as I was - I was bound by Laws.  The protocol of Hell.  The Box had to be opened to let me out.  The truly innocent were safe.  That's no longer true.  The shell of the beast has been fleshed.  What I was is out there, Joey.  In your world.  Unbound. Unstoppable.
I put some decaf on.  Er ... make yourself comfortable.
I'm trying to quit.
Oh.  You wanna talk about that stuff.
The thing!  He was lying there in the street, moaning.  But he pointed at it ... 22
I'll boil some water.
This is great.  And it's yours?  You like own it?
How have you ... ?
... but it is good.  You know, over to the left, you can ...
Maybe he thinks it'll come back.
Terri?
What else came with it?  Anything still here?
I don't know.  Maybe.
No.  I mean, really?  Because I'm concerned for you, sweetheart.  I care about you.  I guess I miss you.  I'm sorry we split up.  I'm sorry I ...
Well ... of course I have.  I've thought.  I've ... Oh, JP, you were so horrible.  You really hurt me ...
Good ... Good ... Look, why don't you come over?  You know, nothing heavy, little drink maybe, little talk.  Just see how we both feel?
I don't think so.  Not yet.  I'm not ready yet.
No.  It isn't ... she wouldn't ... It's like I must have done something wrong, you know?  Freaked her out.  Just fucked up something good again.
So Mr. Coffee, what went down outside the prison?
There goes five seconds...My record's eighteen.
Whoa, you better cut a bigger hole than that.
"And all the monkeys aren't in the zoo."
I can't believe you didn't notice. My weight.  I lost ten pounds in Rome
What the hell....
Let me be the one to quote Scripture.  ....As an agent of our organization, you are put in awkward situations.  Just remember, Hudson Hawk is an evil, evil man.
Anna, what are you trying to say...
"Messed around" messed around?  I know-- I don't want to know.  First base?  Second Base?  Stop me when I'm getting warm...
I know, I know, your Eminence, just say "God go with me."
Oh, the shit is going to hit the fa--
Forget about it--it was nothing-- anybody would have done the same thing--It's an impulse...
As you know, the Da Vinci Codex, has lived in the Vatican for centuries and will continue to live here for centuries more.
And I'll bring my entourage...
Prison?
I was the Warden?
It's not what you think.  Okay, maybe it is....
It's that kind of selfish attitude that...
Uh, yeah.  Guess I'm a wee bit nervous.  I'm sorry I could only score clergy passports.
When the Mayflowers find out we have the Codex, they're going to want to make a deal...
Good job, not pretty, but good.
No, let me!
So, Captain Hawk, in one of your paws you got a gold bar worth about 8 thou.  In the autre, you got lead that won't get you gelato.
You could host American Bandstand in here.  Why did you duck at the auction, asshole?
Come to think of it there is a part of your body that you won't need for your next job...
All this trouble for a horsey. I may not know art, but I know what I like.
Sure.  The Kremlin.  Makes sense. The Kremlin.  Why not?  Listen, this is all too Indiana Jones and the Lost City of King Tut for me, man.  Throw me in jail and go ahead, just try and throw Alex...
Don't be stupid...they...
You just might.  I'm the guy who tricked you into robbing a government installation and then had you sent to prison for it.  At the time, I was bald with a beard, no moustache, and I had a different nose, so if you don't recognize me, I won't be offended.
I used you as a diversion.  while you were getting captured upstairs, I was shredding documents in the basement.  Deep down, I guess I was just jealous.  You were one incredible thief...
No, somebody powerful.  Oh.  Look. what's that up there?
If you do anything to my friend...
With a little jazz.
Oh, of all the foolish... Listen, do you take shorthand? Are you familiar with the mimeograph machine?
Smitty.
...You do?
No! In Vidalia! Farm Route 17!
We have to be realistic, Amy. You know things have slowed down a little here at Hudsucker --
Shutup! -- after all! You haven't talked to me for a week and now I'm going to say my piece. I've got a prediction for you, Norville Barnes: I predict that since you've decided to dedicate yourself to greed and sloth and everything bad, you're going to lose all the good things that your good ideas brought you. You're going to throw them all away chasing after money and ease and the respect of a Board that wouldn't give you the time of day if you... if you...
...Oh, it's you! Lookin' for a nitwit to buy your lunch?!
Norville, I'm sorry, I... I tried to tell you... so many times... It's hard to admit when you've been wrong. If you could just... find it in your heart to -- to give me another chance --
Hey! Where's that martini?!
Yeah, well, monkey or not I'm still editor of this rag. Amy, I thought you were doing that piece on the F.B.I. -- J. Edgar Hoover: When Will He Marry?
You don't know anything! Fact is they haven't bought it! The stock is cheap, Archer! What're they waiting for?
Whatever. That's what sells newspapers.
You're fools, both of you! It's obvious they're out to crucify Norville! They're trying to destroy him!
Terrific.
Sure, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid said I could have the job back.
Ah, it's New Year's, I'm not gonna add to your woes. I'm just saying.
Yessir.
...Well, I'm not sure where I --
That must have been quite a disappointment, Mrs. Mussburger.
Ya don't say.
Mm. Ordinarily I wouldn't bother you with it, but -- this is embarrassing, kid -- it seems to concern you directly.
How's that, Sid?
She's got other problems, of course...
Maybe he's wise.
At the Houmfort.
Haven't I?  I suppose I take it for granted. It's just part of everyday life here.
But how did you get here? What are you doing here?
And that chair --  is the particular property of Mrs. Rand -- mother to both of us and much too good for either of us. Too wise, in fact, to live under the same roof. She prefers the village dispensary.
No -- she just runs the place. She's everything else -- amazing woman, mother.  You'll like her.
-- But, you're an American?
As a matter of fact, it means the sugar syrup is ready to be poured off.  You'll have to excuse me.
I wish I hadn't heard --
You know what she is!  That's death -- no mind, no senses -- no love, no hate, no feeling -- nothing!
That's hard to believe, after what happened last night.
If I were as timid as you seem to think, Mr. Holland, I wouldn't have gone into the tower in the first place.
Help me? How?
You know why.  You saw it the other night at the piano.  You turned away from me.
Ah -- that's where reason took hold.
To the asylum?
I believe there's a kinder name for it, Wesley. At St. Thomas, it's called the Institute for Mental Therapy.
That could be a serious accusation, Rand, if it weren't a foolish one.
Dr. Maxwell -- it's nice to see you.
And speaking of which, you have those market share charts Mr. Shackley was asking about?
Gotcha George, not a problem. Tomorrow. Hey, you want to start covering the old filmed entertainment sector yourself?
Overpriced bomb, cost over $6 million -- no stars, and no one's into the horror genre these days anyway. I'm advising the company recommend reducing positions there. It's disaster films that are gonna stay at the top.
Brilliant. Hey, you heading out a little early today?
Darned right. Look here, Benj, whaddya make of this sequel to The Godfather? You think it's gonna work?
Yeah, see you bright and early Monday am.  Say, where's the wife?
Oh not again Elena! If we've got problems, why can't you just come out and talk about them.
Yeah but Elena, even you don't believe all that "I'm OK. You're OK" stuff you keep babbling about -- you say so yourself. I've been all ears for about ten years now on his subject, and --
You want to go?
I'm, uh, going to bed.
Oh. Sure, I -- Did you remember to pick up the cranberry sauce?
I... I think I am...
What?
Up to you. I'd like to go early and leave pretty soon after that.
What's for dessert?
Don't be dim.
All right.
Fine.
Anyone special? You know...
Yeah?
Damn right, but where the hell were you?
Jimmy? Jimmy? I don't know how to take this. And what do you mean, Jimmy? I thought you said you and your husband --
I'm picking up Paul at the station - want to come?
Actually it's not about work, it's advice about --
But...
What?
That was a joke? You don't tell jokes.
Good shit.
Sure is good shit. It's opiated. I had it in my chamber for a while. I was smoking this other --
It's what?
Look, Elena, the fact that we're neighbors... you know, close friends, well it sort of makes this a little strange, don't you think?
Things are really rotten at home. You wouldn't believe how rotten. Janey's sick. She's unstable, I guess... it's not the right time to tell you... but that's it -- it's like I can't make her happy, the boys can't make her happy, she just doesn't --
Maybe you just need -- look, can you wait here a sec, I need to tidy up -- just a minute, I'll be right back. You'll wait?
Well, I saw what I saw, and if you don't want to believe me --
Educated guess.
Yes.
I suppose my reluctance was the group aspect of it -- I've never been much of a joiner, although I still consider myself a somewhat religious person --
You oughtta read this Hood, Nixon, our leader, all ye need know about the travails of life. Check out the Checkers speech stuff.
Come on Paulie, share the wealth. You copped 'em from her mom's stash anyway.
Sure I do, you know, like your aura. That you give off.
My what?
It's like very positive, and I feel a real special feeling, because you really --
Since he sleeps with every girl you ever show an interest in, why don't you just keep your Libbets thing a secret from him?
No one.
Out.
Maybe we can mess around. You know, only if you want to...
Wow!
I'm, uh, in the midst of a moral dilemma. And I was wondering, because I know you're a very moral person, and --
And?
All my model planes.
Sandy, you scared the shit out of me.
What are you doing?
Well.  It looks like someone got to his private parts before us.
Vodka?
It feels warm.
Have you ever had a nocturnal emission?
Who's that?
Yeah.  All over.
Then change it.
How much closer would you say you were?
What about your shoulder?
We just gotta catch the bastard, right?
Right.  Got lost in the rocks.
Forget your pager?
Where you signed this?
Randy Stetz?
Are you sure about that?
To do nothing.
No way.
That's not what he thinks.
What if someone finds out?
Did you love her?
Kay Connell had a signed copy of one of your books.
Down at the station?
Yes.
Nothing if not vampires...
Who made us what we are?
That is a picture, nothing more.
Then God does not exist...
The one who made you should have told you this. The one who left the old world for the new...
I'm not innocent. But I'm afraid. She feels she's in danger from the others.
And the vampires of the Theatre?
You didn't even warm them, did you?
Why yours alone? Tell me how it was done!!!!
Are they my kind Louis? Dolls never change either.
You know her?
She's no vampire.
That's not so.
Do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word? When he put me in that trance...
You must get into it. It's the only safe place for you when the light comes.
There's nothing in the world now that doesn't hold some...
What, no flowery speeches? About what a monster I am? What a vulgar fiend?
I'm not interested in you. You disgust me. I'm interested in my own nature and know I can't trust you to tell me the truth about me.
What do you imagine you are Louis?
I don't pretend to know.
Lestat, she's alive!!!!
Unless I make her one of us...
Pain is terrible for you. You feel it like no other creature because you are a vampire. You don't want it to go on.
Evil is a point of view. God kills, indiscriminately, and so shall we. For no creatures under God are as we are, none so like him as ourselves.
You remember how you wanted her, the taste of her -
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
So you want me to tell you the story of my life...
So much the better. I've got a pocket full of tapes.
So shall we begin?  What do yo do?
You believe this, don't you? That you're a vampire? You really think...
But you talk about passion, about longing, about things I'll never know in my life! It's still inside you, in every syllable you speak! And then you tell me it ends like that? Just empty?
I don't know, man. Maybe we should keep going, find a phone --
There's a storm comin', Titus. No boats are going out.
I'm not going anywhere. I'm fat, ugly, and depressed.
The number's unlisted...
No way.
Think about this, Julie. What did you actually see?
Karla!
Ray, I can't...
No, I shouldn't have left so fast... I was just...
You're the most beautiful woman in the bar tonight, Jules.
I'm sorry.
It was one year ago...
To get out of Southport?
What?
You've got a better chance of getting hit by lightning.
I scared you -- I crossed the line --
Why are you doing this to me?
I don't think so. It's pretty crowded.
Worse comes to worse, you can stand there and watch me.
To a great weekend --
Come on, it'll be fun.
Well, Karla, what're you doin' at home over the long fourth weekend?
How much?
Cool.
They're around...They just don't care about us 'cause we're the contest winners.  Let's go find Stoner Boy...Make his lazy butt hook us up with fishing poles or Ping-Pong paddles or something.
You know, the greenhouse effect has caused the gulf stream to shift and almost every meteorological expert expects a dramatic increase in tropical depression --
Where's Thea?
There's no reason to decide any of us are going to die.
I have been troubled about you. I want you to know that my room is just downstairs --  You have only to cry out if you are ill â€”â or frightened.
I felt he did not like me.
Your father loved me.  He wanted to marry me. But he was afraid of hurting the gentle, delicate Cathy. You spoiled his life â€”â”you've ruined mine â€”â
What would I be thinking?
You're planing something, Cathy.. But I won't let you â€- I'll warn them against you.
Really, this is idiotic!
You ask that of me? You're afraid to live in your coffin. You know what that means?
Her name is Thea?
She's not too well.
This girl --
You are a happy man Oliver. You have but one world to live in â€- the world of today. I have two worlds. I have that old dark world of peasant ignorance and superstition in which I was brought up and a new world which the army gave me â€”â a world of mathematics, gun ranges,logistics, tactics, strategy.
I've seen men die drunk â€- and I've seen men die of the plague.
We still don't know that it's the plague â€”â
Thea, what's wrong?
Thea, what is this? What are you trying to tell me? "He stole your mother" â€-
Mr. Carter, Merry Christmas.
We're all excited around here.  My brother just got the Congressional Medal of Honor. The President just decorated him.
Good year? Well, between you and me, Mr. Carter, we're broke.
Oh, I don't know. Either I'm off my nut, or he is . . .  . . . or you are!
No.
No wonder you jumped in the river.
What do you mean, no identity? My name's George Bailey.
I . . .
Oh, you mean the kid that had his ears slapped back by the druggist.
What's that?
Oh, no! But, Uncle Billy . . .
Of course it's the place.
Hello, Joseph, trouble?
Mother . . .
Oh, Mother, Mother, please help me. Something terrible's happened to me. I don't know what it is. Something's happened to everybody. Please let me come in. Keep me here until I get over it.
Hi, Daddy.
Zuzu â€“â Zuzu. My little gingersnap! How do you feel?
Big â€“â see! I don't want one for one night. I want something for a thousand and one nights, with plenty of room for labels from Italy and Baghdad, Samarkand . . . a great big one.
Nice girl, Mary.
Hmmm . . .
Aw, forget it.
Oh, it's wonderful.
Yes . . . Yes . . . You're right, son.
Here, now, you're broke, aren't you?
Well, what do you know â€“â wife.
Now you just turn this way and go right straight down.
Why didn't you call me?
All right now, what happened? How did it start?
Those Rockefellers!
Get a tray for these great big important simoleons.
And did you put the envelope in your pocket?
Sure, sure, sure. You go on home and talk about it to your wife.
I'd like to do that.
They don't have that kind of money, Mr. Potter. You know that. You're the only one in town that can help me.
That so? Well, I'll tell him. Hey, that sounds great! Oh, baby, I knew you'd come through. Now, here's the point. Mary, Mary, you're in on this too. Now listen. Have you got any money?
Too young or too old?
You may kiss my hand.
What'd you wish, George?
About what?
When did you get back?
Tuesday.
Would you rather leave?
Is she running a temperature? What is it?
Pop, can I have the car? I'm going to take over a lot of plates and things.
Sure, sure I am.
Oh, shit.
Who's that?  Quick -- I'm in love.
They're okay, if they got little white canes and tin cups.
That's awful.
The lighthouse?
We're carrying weight.
As soon as you get us on the island, you got to call in.  My dad's the mayor....
What is it?  What's there?
Diver's camera.  Tom Andrews brought it up from under that abandoned cruiser.
No place special.  Just hanging out.
I don't know about him -- I'm going down to the dock, maybe go sailing.
Every day?
What else is there to do?
You stay here a minute.
Mike?  Is that you?
You said something about a camera.
Too late, it's written.
Will you listen to this man? Will you just listen to him?  You really caused a panic on a public beach, you shoot up the place, God knows who could've been injured -- what if somebody de- cides to sue us?  That could ruin us.
As soon as I heard about it, I called you.  This thing is big! His arms indicate big.
The Shark's mouth.
We don't know that, do we?
Look, I know a little bit about sharks.
What makes you think there might be?
Hey!  That's my boss!
Sort of -- Mathew Hooper is aboard the research vessel Aurora, presently in the Antarctic Ocean, and won't be in radio range until half-past next spring.
Nothing, huh?
What?
Then that's what I meant.  Fired. Canned.  Out on my fanny.  The Selectmen just made Hendricks the new Chief of Police.  Just like that.
Because of today?  The beach?
I'll give notice.
Are you serious?
We have done something -- hell, we damn near went broke putting up a shark watch tower on the beach -- it's the only one in 2000 miles, y'know.
Two of them are still missing!
Martin, this is kind of an official meeting
Chief -- the Board of Selectmen has a question only you can answer.
10-4, in a few minutes.  He's down checking a buoy in the Bay Channel.
Did he raise the Kids?
Yeah?  Then what?
Can I go swimming?
Some people.
Seventeen.  She's a senior.
I want you to meet my cousin.
Ready?
Doesn't hurt to ask.  Sometimes the most beautiful girls are the loneliest.
Mmmmmm.
Mrs. Brody, look -- if he can't go, then you can't go.  Neither of you can go.
Hurry, please.
Be careful....
Untangle it and let's go -- We don't need a blackout on the island.
Too hot tor those two?  I can't believe it.
We'll be over by the lighthouse.
I'm not sure I can.
No.
I don't need you.  Andy's here.
You always go with Andy.
I want Fruit Loops!
I think we got a couple of live ones.
Oh, my God....
Go on, you're tired.
Don't feel bad.
I don't understand.  Overman's too good a diver to disappear.
I'll need more men to look.
Aren't you suiting up, mate?
How many sharks have you killed?
Pre-opening jitters.
Yeah, you really don't like him.
Okay, forget him now.  I'm going to pick up Sean.  Take a ride?
It's romantic down here.
... Electrical connection malfunctioning.
What mind?  If I had a mind, I'd never have let you talk me into this.
I'd have fallen in love with a pilot or a mountain climber.
You would, wouldn't you?  I'd end up whale shit, you wouldn't care.
Recovering nicely.
You don't.
... Mean through the tubes?
No,  I'm not going through there.
Honey, what is it?
I can't take water, Kathryn.
What's the big deal?  A shark got Overman, and we got the shark.
You don't have to prove anything.
I don't know.  They're nervous and skittish right now.
It's no use.  They won't come into the lagoon.
Well then, can you have them jump to the camera over here?
I thought they were clever.
I told you, something's upset them.
Calvin, I insist I be allowed to capture it!
I insist you get rid of that bomb.
Philip.
Believe me, I am.
I knew it;  it's my fault.  We moved it too soon.
No one's ever done it before. It was a good try...
Musclehead?
... Massachussettans aren't.
Did you see me?!  Wasn't I terrific?
Sean, this is ridiculous.  You're acting very immature.
It's okay, Sean.
What're you doing later?
Ahhh, ahhh...
Hutton, how the hell did you get my crane?
Calvin said it was all right.
Hey, I don't want to hear.
Booked them all at Baskin- Robbins.
Mike, this is fantastic.  I mean, you're responsible for building all this.  What a job you've done! Maybe I'll quit school and come down here and work with you. Brody Brothers Construction. We've always wanted to do that together.  Boat building.
Sure.
You're welcome.  I was the one who cried.
He was such a good-natured kid... Always going out of his way....
Make a list.
No....
I could use a half-dozen more arms ...I've only got two weeks to get this thing finished....
I shouldn't interfere...  My mother-in-law is so neat she puts paper under the cuckoo clock....
You caught me....
You want to try your hand at something...?
Maybe he's got good taste...I don't think he's spent much time with a woman like you....
Stop what?
That....
Don't be late.
Can I ride one sometime...?
I never....
No, no...It's too dangerous....
You're coming, aren't you...?
What's it cost to take a ride on that plane...?
Don't be such a Grandma...I was always climbing something....
Nothing out of the ordinary....
I m not unhappy.  Frustrated maybe... Discouraged a little.  It'll work out....
Flies the plane....
I'm not saying you're wrong, just that there are other possibilities....
What's wrong?
That's hard to imagine....
Because it wouldn't occur to you to know why.  Blushing suits you....
I can't....
Yeah....
How many...?
Shouldn't pick on that.  Sorry.  I'm sorry about your brother....
Money is money....
Trouble with you, Jake, is you have no sense of humor....
We don't write up anything until we're done....
What the hell does Hoagie have to do with this?
Hoagie.
What's so funny about that?
He gambles...He likes a good time...I see him around....
You fall off a horse, you get right back on or you don't ride again....
You'll be the eternal tropo...The old man and the sea...Know the words to this one?  'Oh, the shark has pretty teeth, dear, and he shows them pearly white...'
I've got to get to her....
The big picture...If we can't get him to swallow it, we'll shove it up his....
We need it to eat electronics, man ...Not you.  Get it on me....
Listen to Carla...Marry me...I'm tall, dark and handsome...two out of three ain't bad....
I'm sorry to worry you with this, but we had a real serious robbery, and we- 're chasing a white V.W. van? You guy came up an the computer, so as a matt- er of routine we have to check. Could you tell me who's driven it recently?
How about any guys on your staff?
You want my advice?
I don't mean this "system" shit that keeps you sucking, I mean <u>stop</u> .. I was exactly like you are .. I used to wake in the night - heart going so hard I coulda made love with my left tit .. If I can stop, <u>you</u> can ..
How'd you do it, old man?
Thank Christ we got a witness.
No way .. not me, Mister. I'm not going up there again. Might find someone's prick in a hot-dog roll.
Don't start again. If you win a bet, you can't keep winning it ..
I had one <u>puff</u> on a <u>pipe</u>.
What are you doing, Ross? I've had that 15 years! ..
Six girls over a period of 18 months, and give or take a head or two, the M.O.'s exactly the same. Dark hair. No hands. All shot with a high velocity twen- ty-two in the back of the head.
All but .. How <u>you</u> doing?
Why's she blind, Bro?
That's a very stupid question, Ross.
I dunno what I can do to help you?
Can't thank you enough, Ross ..
Hey, John, don't start getting antsy over this tonight. It may well have been the local cops?
I guess by the bed.
Bits.
I thought it was Taylor's case?
What do you want me to do, Chief?
No, Sir.
It's <u>her</u> hand. <u>Her</u> scars. <u>Her</u> dog. Her dog's shot. And she's missing.
Is that my punishment for embarrassing Mr Heineman?
His blind friend got "attacked." Angelo went up there, and some- how, it got itself in the paper.
I'm Mr Berlin.  Mr Ross is right here. And Mr Ross is maybe gonna take a few notes, if that's O.K.?  O.K. .. I'd like you to tell me in what ever way you want, what you can remember about the time you spent with Amber on the aft- ernoon she left? Take your time, and nothing's too trivial, O.K.
Lotta scratch-marks on your door?
Have you been here long?
I'm sorry, someone slammed the door on me. I couldn't get out.
No.
Oh.
You said, you were in the bad lands?
It's not possible right now.
I know you're trying to help me, but you don't understand.
Why does he want to kill me?
I can't identify him ..
You don't wanna sit here any more, sweetheart ..
Who sought the warrant?
Grateful for your candor, Sir.
A blind girl can just walk out of here, and you don't know who with?
Yeah, I guess I do.
Suzanne? Very pretty. She was a semi- professional model. But a policeman's wife she wasn't. So one day, she just packed it and left. And his whole life went straight down the nearest toilet.
I'm not giving him <u>Pizza</u>. I haven't seem him for a year? I'm gonna cook him a dinner.
Just easy on the words you're putting in my face, Sergeant ..
Damn A, it's O.K. With a bit of luck I'm goin home. What we got?
I think I found some- thing horrible, Sir
Sooner... or later... I'll have to stop.
Who told you?
Don't worry about it -- I never told you what I thought of that memo either --
You lost your head, it happens.  I'm so fuckin jazzed!  Listen. I'm going to have to fly to Chicago tomorrow, how 'bout if we meet in the Dallas airport and we all fly into New York together for the draft?
I just heard.
It's all about you, isn't it? Soothe me, save me, love me --
I know who y6u are.  You're Dorothy Boyd.  You're in... wait... you're in Accounts.  You have the middle cubicle toward the back with that poster of Albert Einstein morphed onto Shaquille 0 Neal's body.
I appreciate that, because some of that stuff... you know, it was two in the morning and...
Wonder what he said.
But I mean really... wonderfully...  great.
... light.
Well, I'm happy for you.
Thanks.
Dennis Wilburn called from Arizona to say he's faxing in the new Tidwell offer on Thursday morning, and you'll be happy.
You don't have to explain.
Maybe you should call her.
What?
Well -- this would be goodnight.
This guy would go home with a gardening tool right now if it showed interest.  Wait.  Use the frosted glasses.
Oh yes.  Jerry Maguire!  My agent! This is a fierce, loving individual, I love this man, he is love, he is about love -- my ambassador of kwan.
I want him to go number one in the draft, and I want him to play.
So you empowered Bob Sugar to deal with Denver behind my back?
Rod --
Man, I got a shelf life of ten years, tops!  My next contract's gotta bring me the dollars that'11 last me and mine a very long time. I'm out of this sport in five years.  What's my family gonna live on? What you get me.  So I don't want to hear about ya shit, your "nya nya nya."
That's your word?
Is that your porty or mine?
I'm out here for you!  You don't know what it's like to be me out here for you. It is an up-at-dawn pride-swallowing seige that I will never fully tell you about! Okay?! Help me help you help me help you.
We can still take the offer, Rod.
Don't I know.  Now go home to your wife.
I don't know -- how's "dedication" for an answer?
For loyalty, you buy a dog.  For love, you get married.
We still having dinner in L.A.?
Jerry!  You made it --
Oh, tell the story.
Gorgeous.
Well, it bothered me somewhat. And I got quiet.  And now she's quiet and we're both pouting a little, you know.  And I decide I'm not going to propose.  The mood is not right. Why be impulsive? Now at this point I know she knows that I was going to propose and didn't.  And she knows I know.  So the entire sixty mile ride back to the airport, we don't speak. And we're both good at that.  We fly to Honolulu in silence.  We check into the Pro Bowl hotel --
Which they do.  And we're standing there. All the football guys are in the lobby, watching, there's even an ESPN crew.  So I turn to her and sort of grandly say, "Well, this is me, Klutz, asking you, Goddess of Rock Climbing, to marry me." And I took out the ring, and I don't much like big scenes, but she said "yes" right there in the lobby and some of the toughest men in football wept like babies.  We're getting married in February.
Marcee, things are changing around here.  You and Rod will have my total personal attention.
"Stay calm?"  I'm freakin...
-- and I'll get 'em.
No.
And then my dad died and my mom took me to the zoo and I love the zoo. Do you hate the zoo or do you love the zoo?
I'm scared.  What is it?
He's gonna have nothing left for next season.  They're letting him kill himself.
We can't just...
You hate to swim.
Young adult.
I'm sorry Amanda. I am. And I'm sorry for the things I said about him.
I don't remember
Paul! Where is he? Can you see him?
Either that, or the government will firebomb it back to the Stone Age.
You had the phone the whole time?
We have to keep looking for Dad. We have to.
It was this strap alone that saved my life. Got caught on a rock as I was falling.
Obviously a superpredator.  Suchimimus. that snout.
We need to keep moving.
Alan, I want to tell you that I'm so sorry about the...
When I met you, I thought that one day millions of years ago, all the dinosaurs became extinct. Wiped out. But you told me otherwise. When conditions changed, dinosaurs changed. They became other things. They evolved.
In Costa Rica?
The first one. Before you where on the island. You liked dinosaurs back then.
Are you sure?
We climb down to the barge and follow the river out to the ocean. With any luck, the Costa Rican coast guard will pick us up.
The lady you called, how do you know she can help us?
Eric, do you know what happened to the boat? that brought you here? Why did it crash?
Well sir, I am a great admirer of yours, and I have an extremely interesting proposition to discuss. Would you let my wife and I take you to have dinner tonight? Our treat.
You know, I've been traveling and I'm very tired. Maybe some other time.
That's a very nice offer, Mr. Kirby, but I'm afraid I'm much to busy. If you like I can refer you to a number of highly qualified...
Establishing a perimeter. Making it safe. These guys are really good. One of them was a Green...
No, I'm sorry, but no. We'll savage what we can from the plane. Then we head for the coast. There may be a boat left, something to get us off this island.
Billy!
You broke that idiot's jaw for no reason other than your boredom.  Tell the truth, Roland.  Aren't you even interested in knowing this expedition's quarry?
Is there an antidote?
Why didn't you tell us about these guys, Ian?!
John . . .
Do you have chromium tapes?  The others fog in high-
The empty shells are crushed and trampled.  The young stay in the birth environment, that's conclusive!
You know, at the bus stop.  With the hair?
Well, is he?
Where does it say that?
Peter, if you want me to run your little camping trip, there are two conditions.  First -- I'm in charge, and when I'm not around, Dieter is.  Your job is to sign the checks, tell us we're doing a good job, and open your case of scotch when we have a good day.  Second condition -- my fee.  You can keep it.  All I want in exchange for my services is the right to hunt one of the tyrannosaurs.  A male.  Buck only.  Why and how are my business. If you don't  like either of those conditions, you're on your own.  Go ahead and set up your camp right here, or in a swamp, or in the middle of a rex nest, for all I care.  But I've been on too many safaris with rich dentists to listen to any more suicidal ideas.  Okay?
You version of it.
What's he got in there?
I think she's with Sarah!
Ian's a very good friend of mine.
WHAT ARE YOU-
Woah, woah, woah, what the hell, what the hell?
No, no, no, that's crazy, you're out of your mind, he's absolutely out of his mind - -
How long will this take?
Remember - - viable embryos.  They're no use to us if they don't survive.
Mr Nedry, Mr Nedry.  The embryos have to be back here in San Jose by then.
I was wondering, how are you planning to beat the security?
Imbalance, disorientation, labored breathing.  Seems to happen about every six weeks or so.
They know very little about the Jurassic Period they know less about the Cretaceous.
- - barfs them up - -
You can't hold it by yourself!
Ellie, com one!!
No.
- - on your hand, the amount of blood distending in your vessels, imperfections in the skin - -
Faster!  Shit, shit, shit, faster!
He sends his apologies.
Grant?  You'll never get him out of Montana.
Are they heavy?
John, we - - what I'm just saying....
I don't believe it.  I expected you to come down here and defend me from these characters and the only one I've got on my side it the bloodsucking lawyer!?
I read your book.
Listen, ahh - -
These look kind of familiar.
Are you okay?  Can you move?  Tim!  Are you okay?
'Course you could just wait in there while we go back and get help.
Come on, try some.  Take a bite.
You're crazy!  I'm not gonna jump!
You got any kids?
You haven't touched  didn't touch anything.  We're stopping.  We've stopped.
Machines hate you?
The kids okay?
Well, I didn't ask.  Why wouldn't they be?
Kids get scared.
Hey, we were saving that!
Robert.  Robert Muldoon, my game warden from Kenya.  Bit of an alarmist, I'm afraid, But he's dealt with the raptors more than anyone.
Yes, yes, yes, which is why we take extreme precautions. They viewing area below us will have eight-inch tempered glass set in reinforced steel frames to - -
Liar!  You said you wouldn't leave!
It's safe?
It's safe.
It's safe.
Oh, I hate the other kind.
Please!
Why didn't I build in Orlando?
I'll keep an eye on it.  Maybe it'll swing south like the last one.
Hello?
Don't tell me you're still thinking of buying Casa de Psycho...
Jesus Christ!
Hello?
Other guy?
He... he's here...
Quite a circus.
I can't wait to hear your opening argument.	"Ladies and Gentlemen	of the Jury... the Defense will prove that Jason Voorhees did not kill all of these people. They, in fact, committed mass suicide and then buried themselves in his back yard..."
Shit. We're still putting the victim list together. You'll need a forklift for the case file. I suggest you hire some help, and don't expect to get a lot of sleep for the next few months.  You're about to defend the most notorious serial killer in American history.
Are you going to plead insanity?
No. When you put me on the stand, I'll say your client is catatonic and exhibits classic symptoms of a schizophrenic, sociopathic personality.  And he doesn't sleep.
Insomnia. Not unusual for someone in his situation.  Not to mention he's a bed-wetter.
That's pretty weird. Is it possible for someone to not sleep for months?
That's right. The murders in the eighties were never solved.  But... there were teenaged witnesses who said Krueger had the ability to appear in your dreams... and that if he killed you in a dream, it would kill you in the real world.
So Krueger thinks Jason's dead... leaves him in the lake... but the boy actually wakes up on the shore... crawls off into the woods... where he lives the rest of his life alone.
I don't know... but I think he's pissed.
You work in the insurance department?
Heralds of a new age -- does that sound immodest?
Preliminary investigations may already be underway.
There is <u>one</u> thing I'd like you to tell me.
If I don't see you later -- go to my house and find my notebooks -- and destroy them.  All my manuscripts -- just burn them. Please.
What an extraordinary request!
A true friend would do it.
Did you see him?
Oh, don't they?  I think you underestimate my station in this office and overrate your own.
It's my place to offer advice, not yours -- and by advising the Chief Clerk of your unpunctuality it's certainly not my situation that's compromised, if that's what you're implying.
It's not healthy, Kafka -- not for you and not for your workmates.  At the annual dinner this month you again failed to make an appearance.
Well, I --
Oh, I know you got along with that poor fellow -- what was his name?
No.
What?
What's funny?
This morning it was suggested to me that my own sense of office fellowship could bear improving.
When I have no reason to doubt.
The very fact that they're authorities should give you reason. People will do anything to protect their own interests.  For all you know he was killed at the <u>hands</u> of the police.
Eduard wanted to marry me.
And you still maintain -- what? That he was murdered.
Yes -- which is why "quiet, dependable people" have to take charge of their own lives.
It couldn't be for that incident with Burgel the other day.
I've heard of it happening.
And Burgel is the bringer of messages, isn't he?
What seems important to these people is not determined by the amount of work it entails -- you're far from understanding the authorities if you believe that.
Gabriela ...?
No -- not this time.
Eight -- and seven months.
His landlady knew of no other friends to refer us to.
He wasn't a lonely man, though.
Probably not.
I'll bear that in mind.
What's the matter with you?
-- Just doing our job.
I believe we've exceeded his expectations.
I did read that.  They gave him a posthumous medal.
What good are records if they're not open for public inspection?
Ludwig.
You look tired.
Then that's the place for us!
I'm coming onboard! Throw down a ladder!
I photographed it extensively, father.
Where do I charter a boat?
Give it back!
What a climax to the film - The first white men to set foot on ...  "Skull Island"  Twentieth Century man comes face to face with a ... a ... naked stone age tribe!
Just take it easy .-- Where are the others?
What?
Denham! Go back to the wall ... Tell'em to give me twelve hours to get back with Ann!
Why?
Uh uh.
Why? She's a junkie.
She was with you after she left Frank.
Yes?
Don't belong?
The truth is I hate them: they must hate me. All right, the money.  All right, not the money. A kind of put-on. It gets things back together.  Well let's say I'd go to one of these cattle-calls, a tryout. I mean before -- before I got this job -- and they'd always say thank you very much and i'd feel, you know, brought down. They didn't want me.
Now there's a picture I'd like you to --
We don't want to just lock him up; we want a conviction, we wanted him to do something more.
What was better? I made better bait?
-- Yes.
No, you're frightened, you're pretending. Well -- Klute knows about me then. Does everybody know, can you tell me?
I'm sorry, I'm just frightened. Yes.
Nothing. Except he wasn't kidding. Usually it's a fakeout, you probably know. They pretend to tie you up, and you wear a dress with a cloth belt and they pretend to whip you or you --  Hell it's their money. I'll hang from the shower rod and whistle Maytime. Except this guy was really tripped out on it; he --
But you can't say that Dumper was Tom Grunemann.
Well could I have them back now hon? -- those tape recordings you've got downstairs -- OK? -- and if you want you can have a good time and I'll have a good time and--
Tell me about Frank Ligourin.
Did you like my friend Frankie?
No.
Hey, but did we get to you, Klute? A little?
Bree -- thanks -- I don't want to.
What's the matter?
Why?
Ligourin: How could you do it?
No, no you're right, I'm sorry. He uses women; he lets them kill themselves. Is that how you want it?
Arlyn was a junkie; I'm not on junk!
You wanted to, or you are?
About what?
Sorry we had to meet here. But I'm pressed for time.
It wasn't Tom that broke in the room.
It has to be Tom. You said he ripped up his own pictures, he --
Someone's been doing all these things.
I wanted to give it to you first.
I'm looking for a man. Tom Grunemann.  Bree thinks he may have been the dumper -- that call she had two years ago. She says you sent her on it.
She told me.
-- Usual case history -- this isn't a medical confidence, it's all of them -- broken family, lonely, confused, crummy childhood, early promiscuity, formal prostitution beginning in her teens, income twenty-five to thirty thousand a year.  Oh they don't keep the money: they get rid of it, they get pimps. Why?  Why do you want to know all this?
Not unusual.
About his letters -- that's all she remembered. Quite violent material, I'd say, obsessive, a quite sick man. But that's not unusual either.
Sounds to me you better shake him again. Put him in a spot he has to do something more -- but this time give him a time and a place to do it.
That's a lot of people to die unknown.
Well?
Klute knew Tom. He has a great many ideas about the case --
That's Kim...and this one's Thelma and that's Mrs. Willewska and this is daddy and that's Batman and over there is Robin.
Welcome to the greatest show on earth.
When is mommy coming back?
Billy, don't eat with your fingers.
Well, I see the Yankees finally won a game.
Sure.  Too much birthday cake, right?
Mom, I mean dad...
You get a new fence.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
That's terrific.  That's really terrific, but I notice I'm the one that's cleaning up this--  Oh, crap, I'll have to do this one over.
Then eat around it.
Now listen to me, young man. Do you know what I had to go through to put this goddamn food on the goddamn table?
Yes?
Ohhh...Ohhhh...Ohhhhh...
It's my name too.
Did mommy ever see this?
Uh, huh?
At your mom's.  She'll have a bed for you in your own room.
Objection!  I must ask that the counsel be prevented from harassing the witness.
Objection!
I see.  Well, you'll have to do better than that.  Do you have any affidavits to support negligence?
I do not, your honor, however--
Six years.
And would you describe those years as happy?
Did you wish to?
Mr. Kramer, why did you set up residence in New York?
So do I.
It was good.  He was a hard worker, a lot of drive, a real hustler.
Mr. Kramer, nobody even thinks about leaving their job until after they get their Christmas bonus.
There might be something at J. Walter Thompson.  But...  ...I don't think they're really serious.  The position's been open for two months and...  They may just be on a fishing expedition.  I'm sure you'll be much happier if you wait until after the first--
In all that time did your husband ever strike you or abuse you physically in any way.
I don't recall.
How long was that?
We were married two years before the baby.  And then four very difficult years.
Oh?  What do you call it then --a success?  The marriage ended in divorce.
My American Express...My Bloomingdale's Credit Card... My check book--
What about Billy?
He looks like a terrific kid.
I want my son.  I'm through sitting in coffee shops looking at him from across the street. I want my son.
Ted, listen to me...You and I, we had a really crappy marriage--  Look, don't get so defensive, okay?  It was probably as much my fault as it was yours... Anyway when I left I was really screwed up--
Goddamnit, Joanna. What the--
He's already got one mother, he doesn't need two...He's yours...  I won't fight you for him any more. He's yours...
Only can I still see him?
Look, it's none of my business, so you can tell me to butt out, okay?  But if you want my advice, you'll send Billy away to stay with relatives for a while.  Just until you get yourself straightened out.
Disappointing.  It only pulled a fourteen share and they were hoping for a twenty-five minimum, and...ah...they're not very happy and...Well, the guys have decided they want to...ah, re-think the entire concept and...Look, I don't like having to do this, okay?... But...I mean, what I mean is...ah, I'm going to have to...ah, let you go--
So...what's so terrible about that?
Now in Haskins vs. Haskins the court ruled in favor of the mother, thus establishing a precedent for awarding the child to the mother even though she previously abandoned the baby.
Mr. Schmidt can't have the figures on the television buy until Monday.
I lost him?  I lost him?
I'll take my chances.
Good Christ, Joanna, just get the hell out of my life.
Yeah.
Boy, you guys are really something, y'know?  I'd like to know one thing, okay--just one little thing.  Did you tell Joanna she should leave me?
I mean, what are you going to do about Billy?
Look, this is nothing personal, but I don't think you can do it.
Got it.
Three.  And add some basil.
C'mon, Thel.  So Charley had a little fling.  So what? All in all he was a pretty good husband.
Thel, you ever hear from Joanna?
He's okay...Thel, can I ask you a favor?
Thelma, if I die--
Yes, Holiness.
Kham, Holiness.
Your people are very brave. They are fighting the Chinese. No one can stop them. Not even me.
Will you buy the sheep for me?
Here. We'll collect them.
Impossible! You will bring famine down on the people of Tibet with these insatiable demands! More food, the best land for your soldiers to camp.
He has been imprisoned, here in the Potala, Holiness.
Yes. Most of the Chamdo region is now in Chinese hands. There is a report from Chamdo which makes quite clear that, unless some settlement can soon be reached, Communist troops will soon be marching on Lhasa.
Oh, no. Where will he go?
You did. We washed you and wrapped you in sheepskin and took you to your father. That day the father got better. And that day, a pair of crows came to nest in our roof. I just remembered.
Shall we consult the protective deities, Holiness?
She carried a basket in her arms, a big, heavy basket, and the old monk cautiously approached. She opened her basket and showed what she had. Heads. Human heads. Only the heads.
Am I running away?
Don't eat all those sweets. You'll get sick.
I did not know him before I married him. I loved his brother, but then, I married his brother, too. He is dead now.
Look for a strong woman, not too occupied with her beauty. Look for a woman who keeps her hands busy. Look for a kind heart.
Mrs. Bickerman, the reason we're up here... a man was fatally attacked yesterday by some animal in this lake.  Do you know how your husband died?
He just <u>appeared</u>.  You have no idea how he arrived in this lake?
You can't take a cow by eminent domain.
Oh, my husband passed away almost two years ago.
Ma'am.  Your husband, Bernie.  You didn't, by any chance, lead him to the lake blindfolded?
You're to wait right here until the police show, you're under full house arrest.
I'll sue you.
You're a beautiful woman.
I do <u>not</u> like you.
This is a setback.
You probably <u>do</u> want to be killed by it, that was you trying to meet your maker.
No!
I just have this feeling everything's totally safe.
Get your big gun and guard the shore.  Hector.  Go to your tent.
I have enough flaxedil with me to put him out.  And I think I know a way to--
He was an Indo-pacific.
Can I tell them you won't go back in the water?
And even if they <u>did</u>, I doubt <u>he</u> or <u>she</u> would have problems with <u>tents</u>.
You know they say the brain confuses fear for passion.
Excuse me?
Yeah.  I got some stuff for your cut.
<u>Ow</u>.  Shit.
Well.  Goodnight.
You calm down!
Just heard from Wildlife and Florida Fish And Game.  They should be here by four.
We might as well pack.
Watch out!!
Get him onto shore.
We set?
Half mile up, there's a clearing.
Even if we <u>could</u> tranq him-- how would we get him on land.
What?
You have a thing against museums?
We don't mean to invade your privacy but... was he ill, was he sick?
Hey!!
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
What?
A tooth they say couldn't have come from any bear.  They say it looks prehistoric.  Like maybe a dinosaur.
Kelly--
I'm not going to Maine, I won't even go west of Forty-third Street--
"Desperately random." What does he mean?
FBI, Catherine, you're safe.
I need the ID to fly with my gun. The gun belongs in Quantico.
Starling -
Might I suggest tucking your pants into your socks? To prevent mouse intrusion.
You're playing a piano, Miss Starling?
That wasn't me.
Well? Why aren't you there right now?
Why?
I lied to Lecter. I'll need some kind of peace offering... Can I get the drawings from his cell?
I'm Bureau for 28 years, Starling. I won't disobey orders, not even now.
Starling - you've earned back your place in the Academy. We never would've found him without you, and nobody's ever going to forget that. Least of all me.
Stacy, did Fredrica ever mention a man named Jamie Gumb? Or John Grant?  Do you think she could've had a friend you didn't know about?
I think so.
Doctor, we have a hard problem in psychological profiling. I want to ask for your help with a questionnaire.
"We" being the Behavioral Science Unit, at Quantico. You're one of Jack Crawford's, I expect.
Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?
What's that, Dr. Lecter?
Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?
Scared, at first. Then - exhilarated.
I don't know. Is it?
Who killed Raspail, Doctor...? You know, don't you?
That is both impudent and untrue... Tell me, how did you feel when you viewed our Billy's latest effort?  Or should I say, his "next-to-latest"?
Killed outright?
Why so briefly?
I think you were telling me the truth in Baltimore - or starting to. Tell me the rest now.
I've studied the case file, have you...? Everything you need to find him is right in these pages. Whatever his name is.
What is the first and principal thing he does, what need does he serve by killing?
Anger, social resentment, sexual frus-
Dr. Lecter, when there's time I'll -
They were slaughtering the spring lambs?
Your lambs are still for now, Clarice, but not forever... You'll have to earn it again and again, this blessed silence. Because it's the plight that drives you, and the plight will never end.
The Ottawa are gone.
And what were the consequentialities of European culture you didn't bother with?
Mr Poe?
No. I will find you.
What is it?
"Justice"?  If that's "justice"..., then the sooner French guns blow the English army out of America, the better it will be for these people.
How far is it, scout?
Of course not!  And how is it you were nearby?
No.
Then you are one of those who would allow England to fight alone while she protects you from France?
Folks here goin' to join in that fight?
I'll have none of that!  Montcalm is a soldier and a gentleman. Not a butcher.
Easy for you to suppose. While it is their women and children, not yours, alone in their farms!
The Crown "negotiating" the terms of service?
I know.  One has to give Americans "reasons" and make agreements to get them to do anything at all.  Tiring, isn't it?  But that's the way of it here.
Sir!... Might I inquire if General Webb has heard from Colonel Munro's daughters? I was to rendezvous with them in Albany and escort them to the fort.
Not with enough certainty to outweigh British interests in this fort.
General Webb can burn in hell. We'll go back and dig our graves behind the ramparts! Our mission is to fight.
Right - about face! March! First rank present!
If Magua give women to Yengeese soldiers... will receive many gifts.
Nathaniel's word been good on the frontier a long time before you got here!
Does the chief of the Canadas believe the English will keep the terms?
My colors?
Are you planning on working tomorrow?
What's wrong?
I'm not a doctor.
Why stop with just one aspect of marine life?  Why not incorporate the best genetic components the ocean has to offer?...
Bullshit...I was just talking to him.  I saw him move.
What has?
Think!  Can we stop it?! Block it up?!  Shut down the line somewhere?!  Think!
You did good...
I need more light on that, Four.
It hit me!  Where are they?!
What about our quota?
Something wrong, Cobb?
Excuse me, sir...
How do you feel, DeJesus?
Okay.
And it killed Bo?
Well, according to Maritime law, you, as commander of the Shack have the authority to dispose of the body.  However, the company doesn't want you to do that.
Beck, trust me.  If the company felt that you or your crew were in any danger we would authorize an immediate emergency pickup. We could be there in a few hours.
If he had his blinkers on--
What happened?
Still bothering you?
Itches like hell.
So that's all you do?...
Cobb's cut...It was in him! It got Doc...
I would rather put my money on a three-legged rocking horse. The odds are a hundred to one for a good reason, BACON . . . it won't win. So where is Ed with all the bright ideas?
Yes?
Scarface, I have watched Scarface. You want to know how to do a drug deal, you watch Scarface!
You want a pint, go to the pub.
You fucking well have to get 'em!
Inside, out-fuckin'-side. I don't give a shit, you get those guns because if you don't . . .
I think I can help you, as it happens.
The boys had 'em. I know you like these things; wondered if you wanted them?
Son, have a look in his locker.
Well, you had better go and get it from the office. That's if you want to see your son reach his next birthday. Now chop-fuckin'-chop.
Yeah?
The stupid bastards! Count it!
Shit, Dog, there's a lot. Don't you want to do this next door?
Do you want me to take his leg off? Where's the fourth?
Out the back.
Yeah invitations, you know a pretty white piece of paper with your name on it.
Right as rain.
I'11 meet you in the car.
You got it all?
I need two hundred and fifty grand.
What are you talking about? I am bloody skinny, pal.
Never mind that now. I also need some artillery, you know, a couple of sawn-off shotguns.
I got contacts. Listen Tom, if you pointed them at me I'd shit myself or do whatever you said to do. Either way you still get the desired effect.
What you telling us for? The only thing I care about is whether you get your rest in.
Where did you get those from, a museum?
This guy Rory Breaker can afford to do the deal at the price we are selling. It's not worth him giving us trouble; he knows we would be a pain in the arse, and who wants a pain in the arse?
I would take a pain in the arse for half a million.
We need fertilizer, Winston.
I don't pretend I came over on the Mayflower--
I'm only going to have you for two more years. If you decide not to go on to college--
They're not going to jail.
Just some rich Anglo out on the lake. Don't even live here all year.
They stole our land--
Follow orders. Do whatever they say.
I do, sir.
How's business?
September '97, that's all she wrote.
You ever shoot anybody was looking you in the eye?
Bunny, you--uhm--you on that same medication?
Bunny, is that stuff I left in the garage still there?
You kind of bought yourself a pig in a poke, didn't you, Sam? All that time we were first seeing each other you didn't know I was tightly wound--
It wasn't just you, Bunny.
Colonel. Is uhm--is Otis in?
If it's too late--
I never met her.
No sir.
He was part of the Seminole Nation, got pushed down into the Everglades in pioneer days. African people who run off from the slaveholders hooked up with them, married up, had children. When the Spanish give up Florida, the U.S.Army come down to move all them Indian peoples off to Oklahoma--
They teaching that now?  Good. Only a couple of 'em held out--this man, John Horse, and his friend Wild Cat, and a fella name of Osceola. Army put all of them in prison and Osceola died, but them other two escaped and put together a fighting band and held out another ten, fifteen years. Beat Zach Taylor and a thousand troops at Lake Okeechobee.
They were in the Army. Like your father.
You know who I am?
Public Display of Affection. Every time he moves up a rank, it's like he's got to tighten the screws a little more--
Well--
Homework?
How's your room shaping up?
Yeah. He lives here, right?
Fifteen years in El Paso.
Made some money, came back here--
It's not just cactus.  There's the nopals, the yuccas--
Looks like a lot of cactus to me.
Guy cracks walnuts with his asshole.
Mikey--
So where does that put us?
We been through this before--
And if I get a shot at a promotion somewhere--
Sheriff--hi--this is Sergeant--this is Priscilla Worth.
Good deal you were born down here, then.
That's where he fell.
So.
We have an enlisted man's club at the post.
I heard somebody been haulin' wets on this road.
Reputation?
Vi a Rosaria arastrado para el corriente--[I saw Rosaria taken away by the current--]
We was by the river? And I hear my friend callin' for help, and I look and she has falling in the water--
We have a daughter.
Every other damn thing in the country is called after Martin Luther King, they can't let our side have one measly park?
King wasn't Mexican, Fenton--
Your mother was a saint.
I told the story enough times--hell, we were just in the car, he was stewing about the fight with Buddy while we drove over to Roderick Bledsoe's--
Bledso
No. I think his widow's still in their place in Darktown, though.  You think it's Charley Wade, huh?
We have a murder?
I wish I could tell you I remembered something new, but I can't.
Steve called for you.
You got to be interested in somebody. All you do is work.
The Sheriff.
These ones coming up are getting stupider every year.
Nobody is illegal in my cafe! They've got green cards, they've got relatives who were born here--if they only had a little common sense I'd be very happy.
If you spent a little more time training them--
I felt that you could do better for yourself--
We run that twenty-odd years. Give it over to Otis Payne in 1967. April.
Not if I can help it.
Okay? He's not here?
I'd like to see them spend a day pulling 14-year-olds off of each other--I should get combat pay--
Nobody really wears that stuff, Paloma.
How come?
Three months.
So I've heard--
Your mother still doesn't like me.
I see she built a place up here by the river.
I was on the playground with all the other kids, but I thought he was only looking at me. I was afraid he was going to arrest me--he had those eyes, you know--
Amado.
I should get back.
You know the other day, you asked why I came back?
Couple months before I was born--
From the first time I saw you at school--all those years we were married to other people I always felt like we were connected.
Yeah--
They got telephones.
You're the one who's a good boy. Man say "fetch" and you fetch--
Just doing my job.
I heard about that deal for your father--You must be real proud.
So when did Buddy leave?
You know who it was?
Thirty-five bucks.
Nix.
How?
Maybe they're not tricks.
So do you.  You've seen the future. Haven't you?
I want you to help me help my husband.  I know he's in some kind of trouble.  And it's something to do with the man you saw murdered.
Yes.  They weren't close, but they saw each other once in a while.  I think Philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards.
They won't tell you anything.
That's my business. Harry.
It doesn't ring a bell.  I have to go.
Okay.  I'll keep digging.
Nix ran some kind of cult, right? Some kind of Charlie Manson deal?
So Swann was performing magic. not illusions?  And what?  You thought he should be using it to cure cancer, not making millions.
Too much fame.  Yeah, I guess that'd turn anybody's head. Including yours.
It's okay.
Quaid and Jennifer--
Harm to whom?  Me?  I don't think, so.  Try him again at the hotel.
Yeah.  Remember Quaid?
Sure.  You want me to find out about Quaid?  I mean, the funeral?
You believe that?
They weren't worth a damn.
Great accent, by the way.  Is it Brooklyn?
What are you, my mother?
What's the difference?
It's not a bad place.  Warm. Great view.
She doesn't want to see you. She's had enough pain.  Enough churning over the past.  She wants it all left alone.
Are you satisfied now?
You rigged the illusion to fail, right?
Yes.
What about?
You've taken some strange journeys in your life.
I'm not afraid to die.  There's something terrible... coming home...
Look, Ma, no wires.
Illusionists get. Las Vegas contracts, D'Amour.  Magicians get burned.
You think I'm an asshole.
I distract them from their banality for a few minutes. It's like a public service.  It doesn't mean much in the end. They're all going to die.
They got here before us.
He did something with the ground.
What is?
I don't want to think about it. If I think about it he'll hear me. He'll find me.
Is he the Puritan?
And?
Just get me out of here as soon as you can.
What did you study?
Oh, hi.
What do you feel like singing, Bob?
Hey look, it's Sausalito.
I'm stuck. Does it get easier.
You'll figure it out. I'm not worried about you. Keep writing.
We used to have fun, she used to like to go to places with me for my movies and we would laugh at all the weirdos, but now she's tired of it all. She never wants to leave the kids, she doesn't need me, and they don't need me, I feel like I'm in the way. It gets complicated when you have kids... that changes everything.
No one ever tells you that...
But, it's great being with them, after they can talk, and can do things with you.
You think so?
Do you ever see him?
Yeah.
So, where'd you go today.
When are you leaving?
I'm going to miss you.
Hi, Bob.
Just saying good-bye to everyone before you leave?
Oh?
I guess she's busy.
When are you coming home?
Ok.
Evelyn Waugh?
I'm not, but do you have to point out how stupid everyone is.
I went to a temple today and I didn't feel anything.
A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Character and calling? Is this yours?
Oh... that's nothing, someone gave it to me.
You never said anything to me...
Bad?
Weird.  The book again.  Sex spelled backwards...
Did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings?
There you are!  My God, darling, I've been so worried.  Are you alright?
Claire...
And how would you describe him?
Tell the jury how many people work in that office with you and Mr. Viznick.
When your secretary called, she made no mention of her coming, too.
So you don't believe his condition is the result of anything supernatural?
This patient has been plagued with temporal lobe seizures.
I'm aware of that, but I don't think he's in any condition to make requests. I'm trying to appeal to your more...logical self, Father.  I'm concerned about harm to my patient.
If you really believe in God, why is it so inconceivable that his enemy is just as real?
The doctor's concerned he may never come out of this dementia.
Between your book sales and this TV thing, there's going to be no living with you.  And let me guess, you boiled God down to a conceit.
You are my son.  Don't you see the opportunity that lies before you?
Father, please don't die.
What's his name?
May I help you?
And also that...
Listen, I'm sorry, but I'm running late.
Not the most popular opinion, but yes.
And I also believe in God and the Devil. In fact, I know they exist.
In the end, the jury saw it my way.
Do you remember Henry Birdson?  The math professor who won the Salwen Medal, then went home and killed his family?
I think you gave me the wrong one.
Get up!!
What do you mean?
No oxygen to the brain.
I'll be all right.  Peter, at the very end, I think Father was back.  I saw it in his eyes.
You can't back out on me now.  We need to be sure.
The police used him as a witness in this case.
Yeah.
As a part of today's story on the trial of mass murderer George Viznick, we welcome Peter Kelson, author of the current best-seller, VICIOUS INTENT. Thank you for joining us, Peter.
Would you sign it for me?
How're you doin' today?
Where is she now?
I hate it.
What?
Yeah, you met her?
So what do I do?
She's alright.
So that means it's alright for you to act like that?
Well, thanks again.  This was really nice of you.
What?
Coach...
Thanks.
Don't go starting rumors, Jim.  My son's college bound with or without basketball.
Why not?
To do what you love.
Like you don't give her a hard time.
How'd you get him to say yes?
I told him you looked like me.
They ever love you back?
Just wanted to say good game.
Well, what do you know.
So what are these Spanish guys like?
I never knew a girl that could play.
I'm going to be number thirty-two, like Magic.
I don't have to do what you say.
What?
So she's honest.
With a jacked-up attitude.
Yeah, the DJ's kinda whack, though.  So who is this clown?
What was that about?
You finish the reading for E-con?
Forget Tonya Randall.
You're not stupid.
Nothing.  Why don't we walk to my dorm?
Fine...Maybe I'll come by later.
Hey, what's up.
What the hell's going on?
I just took the ho to Burger King, alright.
So you fucked around to prove a point!
How are you going to tell me what I have time for?  I mean, whatever I did...we can fix this.
Still working on being the first girl in the NBA?
You haven't changed.  You still think the sun rises and sets on your ass.  Well, guess what, it doesn't.
No.
There's so many I just can't keep track.
The doctor'll be back in a minute.
I'm not playing with you, these girls are looking to get you caught.  They see you, they see dollar signs.
Okay.
Where's your dad?
You scared me.
You don't wanna hurt your back.
You know, people.
I'm also good enough to go pro.
Your mom was real quick to show you those pictures, wasn't she? Well, she was nineteen when she got pregnant and don't get me wrong, you're the best thing in my life, but she knew I wasn't ready for no marriage.
Don't remember that being my fault. Seems like you divorced me same time as your mom.
Good.
I'm fuckin' hammered, Burt.
I'm telling you right now, I'm fine. I lost my goddamn balance and I couldn't see a moment, but I'm ok.
What's wrong?
It was scary though.
It's a helluva disease.
I'm not saying that, I'm sorry --
GET THE FUCK OUT.
No.
You don't have a boyfriend?
No.
You mind if I check things back here?
Claudia: Why don't you let me handle the questions and you handle the answers, ok?
That'd be fine.  So, Claudia, lemme just say, so I can get my role of LAPD officer out of the way before we enjoy our coffee  I'm not gonna write you up or anything, I'm not gonna give you a citation here -- but the real problem we have is that there are people around here, people that work from their homes, people tryin' to get some work done, and if you're listenin' to your music that loud:  They're incovenienced by that.  If you had a job you'd probably understand, but I see you like listenin' to your music and that's fine, you're just gonna wanna keep it down at a certain volume, maybe memorize what number you see on the dial and just always put it to that -- If it's the middle of the day -- that's what I do -- just put it on two and a half and that's a good listening level, alright? I see you like listenin' to your music loud, but, hey, forget about the neighbors, you end up damaging your own ears ok?
Yeah.
I'm gonna run to the bathroom real quick.
It's my favorite place --
Did you ever go out with someone and just....lie....question after question, maybe you're trying to make yourself look cool or better than you are or whatever, or smarter or cooler and you just -- not really lie, but maybe you just don't say everything --
Well, that's a natural thing, two people go out on a date, something.  They want to impress people, the other person...or they're scared maybe what they say will make the other person not like them --
So you've done it --
No, I'm sorry.  I'm saying I'm sorry. I talk like a jerk sometimes --
ok.
Yes.
-- what kind?
Ready to go,go,go?
No, Son...be quiet...be quiet now...
GIVE US YOUR MONEY, KID.
Tell me what you know, I'll tell you what I know --
Hey. Watch the mouth. Watch it.
C'mon, man, just watch me, watch and listen --
Alright, alright, cut it, coolio. That's enough with the mouth and the language.
Finish it up without the lip.
-- the kind of love that makes you feel that intagible joy.  Pit of your stomach. Like a bucket of acid and nerves running around and making you hurt and happy and all over you're head over heels....?
No.  I mean, I'm telling you: I'm telling you that I have love.
And I'm listening avidly, fellow.
Yes they do, they do, but I'll make my dreams come true, you see?  I will.
"If a brick weighs one pound plus one half brick -- how much does the brick weigh?" "Well if subtracting the half of brick from the whole brick you got one half of brick, equals one pound so therefore the brick equals two pounds --" "A little more than kin and less than kind," is Hamlet to Claudius. "The sins of the father laid upon the children," is Merchant of Venice but borrowed from Exodus 20:5 and "win her with gifts if she respects not words," is Two Gentleman from Verona. Where? Who? How and Why, Kids?
He has Phil right now.
...ah...
No.
...ah...maybe...yeah...she's a good one...
There's no asshole like you.
How come every word you say is either "cocksucker," or "shitballs," or "fuck?"
No.
What?  Say it again...walking in the car?
I think you have the wrong number.
Is this 509-9027?
If you're up to it, I've got us set up in a suite upstairs --
-- see, I thought you grew up here in the valley --
-- and I try and teach the students to ask: What is it in aid of?
Are you asking me that?
She does.  From when you were a boy.
No, this is about getting something right and claryfying one of your answers to an earlier question --
So you sat it out, that's what you did?
the valley?
Why does that sound silly?
Is Linda here?
How long have you taken care of him?
No one else in here?
Ok. What's your name?
Marcie.
And what about screaming?
This is the LAPD, if anyone is in the closet I want you to come out and show yourself to me, slowly and with your hands up --
THERE'S NO ONE IN MY MOTHERFUCKIN CLOSET AND STAY OUT OF MY BEDROOM, STAY OUT OF MY GOD DAMN BEDROOM.
...you know...
Will you say my name?
We're on the air in twenty minutes, Jimmy.
We are not on display.  I am not a doll. I AM NOT A DOLL...I' M NOT SILLY AND CUTE. I'M SMART SO THAT SHOULDN'T MAKE ME SOMETHING, SOMETHING SO PEOPLE CAN WATCH HOW SILLY IT IS THAT HE'S SMART?  I KNOW.  I KNOW THINGS. I KNOW. I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM AND I HAVE TO GO.
I'm drinking.
Come home soon after the show.
I don't know.  I have to go, I don't have time and I have more drinking to do before I go march --
No, I mean:  I'm telling you this, now. You see?  You see I want to make everything clear and clean...and apologize for me....for all the stupid things I've done....that will eat me up....
You feel like you want to be forgiven for your sins?  Honey, you're not on your death bed, yet....this kinda talk's gonna get you in trouble --
Yeah.
No.
What about now?
It's over becuase...for all the the right reasons I hope, what I said.
What? No, Rose, jesus, no --
I don't know....
I really don't know.
I don't know what I've done.
Stay here, please don't leave me, please, please, if I said I knew would you stay?
Yes.  What's your name?
You should get one, I'm serious, you could get a lot of stuff out of this --
Not exactly, Linda. I'm not sure where you're going with this --
-- I have something to tell you. I have to tell you something. I want to change his will, can I change his will?...I need to ---
Where will the money go?
Well.  Considering that there's no one else mentioned in the will...we'd have to go to the laws of intestacy, which is -- as if someone died without a will --
I've got Frank...Frank Earl's son. He's...he asked me to get him and I did --
No, Linda, you don't understan --
Hi. I'd like to get an order for delivery.
Phone number.
Yeah.
Do you have that?
yeah, I said.  Is that it?
Yes. What? Yes.
What do you do?
Should be one-thirty.
This happens....this is something that happens.
Because I have dreamed of him.  Not as the baby they took away, but as a man.
Louis, please -- !
But Aramis -- !  Phillippe can learn in time, but --
But --
Remember, Phillippe... nobility is born in the heart.
He seeks redemption.
You're a fool!
I just said you're praying!  Are you deaf too?  I know you're blind, because if you had seen the tits that just walked out of here, you'd have tears in your eyes.
Forgiveness.
Who?
What do we do now?
D'Artagnan, unready?
What choice is there?  If Phillippe is in the Bastille, then to the Bastille we will go.
Mother's ring.  I can't take this.
But -- are you sure?
Piglet -- ?  What are you -- ?
Thanks, but not for me.
They must stay sharp.  There was an attempt on the King's life today.
I have dispatches a message to Fromberge requesting that Raoul be kept far from the fighting.
He lies.  He is here to trap us.
Whose rooms are those?
Are you hungry?
A man in black.  I never saw his face.  He took me to the cell.  A blacksmith came and they put me into the mask.  For days I shouted, "What have I done?  Why do you do this to me?"  But no one heard, so I just stopped shouting.
A personal nature?
Silence!  I order you!
I will consider it.  Now leave me.
I want all these passages sealed! Another stupid idea of my father's! Seal them all, every one!
What number did you tear out?
How did I get in?  You're new here, and will soon learn many secrets. What is that?
Raoul... is in love...
It's lovely.  It's just...
Wait, no!  Do not be ashamed.  The straits of your family need not be permanent.  It is a simple matter to have them brought to one of my country estates, where they may have fine meals, and physicians to look after them.
Sire, I --
Shall I leave?
Did you know... about Raoul?
It's Marvosa -
He walked in on Fleming and took him out.
You mean shut your ass down!
I'm going to look for him on my own. Fuck this.
Outside hacker?  What the fuck are you talking about?
Anyhow...	you wake up and she's gone. But--  --this is my favorite part--  she leaves you the keys to a brand new Beemer.
And what did he do to the girl?
That's not all.  According to the computer - she died of a drug overdose last year.
Speak of the devil.
What exactly did you see?
No, but I'm listening.
Tubbs, it's me.
You are drunk.  You know, it's been a long time and I'd love to catch up, but I really got to -
No...
Jimmy, do you realize what you did? Man that's like death penalty shit -
Shit, you know what happens to me if I'm harboring a fugitive?  I already think they're on to me! I thought you were the phone police for Chrissake!
Did you have sex with her?
Long gone, huh?
Oh yeah?  You're a smart man?...
It was you who did the asking.
You're never alone in a room with Graham, are you? You're smooth about it, but you're never one-on-one with him. Why's that? Do you think he's psychic?
If he pushes too deep into our boy's mind-set, he may destroy himself.  What are you planning, Jack?
Sidney: I don't understand him.  We know he re-arranges the kids and husbands into a dead audience.  To witness the act. We know he thinks the act is making him into something different. His 'becoming'... but I don't know what it is he thinks he's becoming.  The answer is something to do with how he uses the mirrors. That's what's missing for me.  Why the mirrors?
And do what? Read about the next family in the morning paper?  In my Monkey Ward safehouse 'cause I can't take my family home?  This ends when I make it over.
How are Molly and the boy?
It has to be a book the Tooth Fairy would know Lecktor has in his cell.
Aniline dyes in the inks in felt-tip pens -- which is what Lecktor has -- are transparent to infrared. The Tooth Fairy's ballpoint isn't...
I have to.
He thinks you want him to look at evidence.
I don't want to talk about it anywhere.  If you brought pictures, leave them in the briefcase. Molly and Kevin will be back soon.
What else did you keep out of the papers?
And I got you down here fixing fuckin' boat motors.
You look all right now.
Milwaukee, Madison, Dubuque, Peoria, St. Louis, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Toledo and Detroit.
He's very careful, very... designed when he chooses.  If we find out how he finds them, then we'll find him.
We want the cans the Jacobi home movies came in.  They're in the far corner of the room under the windows.
...twenty-eight minutes.  Cryptography at Langley?
Ms. McClain, I'm Francis Dollarhyde. I came about the low light level infrared film stock.
Shooting at maybe eight feet. I can't use any lights.
When do you need it?
Are you okay...?
Me.
THEY WILL FIND OUT ABOUT YOU.  THEY WILL LOCK YOU IN A PLACE WORSE THAN BROTHER BUDDY'S.
Are you cold? Would you like a blanket?
Do you know who I am, Mr. Lounds?
Freddie Lounds. Your photograph. Do you see?
You will tell the truth?
I want to see Lecktor now.
Well, it's about goddamn time!  I have a note here, or two pieces of a note, that appears to be from the man who killed those people in Atlanta and....
We're looking for Graham. The man the book is supposed to go to is a Mr. Will Graham.
Now I'll bet it has his home address there, too
He asked how you are.
Hey, baby! Where are you?
At the store. You doin' some good?
Tell me about yourself.
Eating junk food.  They don't have a lock on anything, Molly. There's not enough information. Or I haven't done enough with it...
He didn't know you had been in a mental institution. Be asked me if I knew. I said yes. I wanted to talk to him. He said he wanted to bring it up to you. Face to face.
You haven't smoked in two years.
Small difference: I'm not dead, yet.
You going back down to Florida after?
What's that?
There's a VTR setup waiting in your hotel room, that you asked for. They transferred the home movies of both families onto half-inch VHS.
In this hatchery? Forty to fifty.
It's a precaution...  Why don't you run down to the bay. They got a swimming float.
I figured I'd ask you...
I told my dad before he died, I'd take care of Mom. And I'll do it.  This guy wants to kill you?
And Hobbs died?
And how is Officer Stuart? The one who was the first to see my basement.
Why should I tell you?
I thought you might be curious to find our if you're smarter than the person I'm looking for.
What disadvantage?
Big backyards, fences, some hedges, why?
That's interesting.
May I keep the file?
What do you want?
Fight what?
Glaser Safety Slugs?
Because he's gone for the head shot seven out of eight times'
So I understand you're from Lithuania?
Andy... this is every comedian's dream.
Of course.  But only on Monday nights.
Tell you what.  I'll book you on some concerts, and meanwhile, we'll show the Special around... see if somebody wants to buy it --
When you play the Midwest and South, you DON'T MINDFUCK THESE PEOPLE! It's not postmodern -- it's rude.  If you wanna perform in Texas, you give 'em Mighty Mouse!  You give 'em Elvis!!
I'm here with Ed over at Taxi. There's been some trouble with Tony.
What, you don't think I can beat him?
What was that all about?
I wanna go back to work and put on a happy show.  The best show anybody's ever seen!
Really?
Andy!
Excuse me -- ?
What do you mean?
Is this an act -- or are you addicted to causing trouble??
I don't deserve Haagen Daz.  I'm a horrible person.
Andy, it'll be fine!  It's what we're known for!  "Maui?  "Wowie!"
Are you nuts?!  40 million people watch you every week!
So?  What do they know?
I dunno about this...  What will my mother think?
Well, call SAG.  It'd be cool to get one on the show.  I want the evening to build and build.  It's gonna have the most incredible ending: Singers, dancers, the "Hallelujah Chorus" -- then the sky opens, and Santa Claus comes flying down!
Goals are important.
I stopped drinking.  I gave up drugs.  And I'm meditating three hours a day.  It's the center of my life...
Why??  I... I attend every year.
It is apparently not working.
So you've got this big elaborate joke, which is really only funny to two people in the universe.  You... and you.
It's a perfect Kaufman audience.
Is he in his room?
Why is he saying these things?!
Then the informant is real.
They are dead.  In either case --
Oh shit.
He's gonna make it.
Don't be ridiculous.
Are you sure this line is clean?
I got a fibrillation!
We found him, Trinity.  We finally found him.
You can't use that until Neo is out!
Hello?
What truth?
Why do my eyes hurt?
You -- you're too fast.
Do you know why you didn't make it?
If you are killed in the Matrix, you die here?
The beginning?
And she's never wrong.
Yes I do.
No.  No!  Morpheus!  Don't!
Bingo.  Not quite what you were expecting, right?  I got to say I love seeing you non-believers. Always a pip.  Almost done.  Smell good, don't they?
Who?
My name is Trinity.
It's necessary, Neo.  For our protection.
Get this thing out of me!
E.M.P.  An electromagnetic pulse.
What did you just say?
We can't leave him!
Goddamnit!  Goddamnit!
What?
I'm coming with you.
What are they doing to him?
So did we.  I sent him to Franklin and Erie.
There is.  We have to pull the plug.
Know where he is?
It's obvious that the girl doesn't want to accompany you, isn't it?
Whether she wants to or not...she's not going.
Riverdale.
Yeah.
Ok, you guys get out, and wait here for me.
And I wouldn't call it TONY'S PLACE or CHARLIE'S PLACE...  I'd call it something like SEASON OF THE WITCH... get it?
Who's the girl?
It's an open ticket.  I can go anywhere up to $350.
Waddaya think?
What happened to you Flash?
I won't wait until Tuesday.  I'll break your arms right now.
It's impossible for you to catch up on the loan now...the interest is going up...$3,000...do you realize that, flash?
That's what I get for getting involved.  Look, on pay-day at least show up at Tony's Place to meet him, ok?  This way he doesn't think that you're trying to screw him.  If you show good faith and save his face maybe we can talk and he'll take off the interest or make different payment arrangements or something... understand?  I'm not asking I'm telling you!!
Oh, cut it out, will ya?
Back so soon.
This can't be settled any other way now...I'll take full blame.
Look Charlie, you're a good boy. Will you just tell your uncle that I have nothing.  There is nothing to give him.  No envelopes with cash inside, no checks, nothing.
You getting out too?
'But I say to you, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute...'
You know Diane...I've been wanting to talk to you for a while now...er... a...  aside from all that joking around we do out there...when you're on...I... a...I really...think that you're a terrific performer...
Fine.
Wasn't a book...was a short story.
No, c'mon...Y'know, I read.
Charlie...?
No.
It doesn't make any sense.  He wouldn't shoot him just because he insulted a racket guy...not unless it was personal.
You're intolerable today.
I'm going to take that apartment uptown.
Ummmmmmmmmmmmm.
The building on the corner.  That one!  He's been on the roof a half hour now!
Lower the fuckin music--I can't hear nothin.
Put it on the little tab so that it balances with the big one.
I know...I know.
How about me?  I don't get a drink John?
That's your name?
He's coming.
His wife?
He's cute.
Whatever it was, they'll be here. We sent out invitations to everyone, plane tickets included -- the RSVP's are amazing.  A few of them we didn't hear from, and some of them are dead, of course --
The fountain is the Caspian Sea and the Sea is serving up caviar.  The 'B's for Beluga, the 'P' for Petrossian.  Of course, they also stand for 'Bill' and for 'Parrish'.
Honey --!
What do you do that for?
Good, good.  Glad to hear it.
Yes, sir?
You don't mean that.  You wouldn't disappoint Daddy --
Here...
Perhaps you could remind me.
So... Board convenes tomorrow, you'll recommend, we close and it's a deal, right?
Sorry.  I know it looks like I'm reversing my field.
Shall we adjourn?
Yours.
Bontecou wants a quick response and --
Hey, this is it, the hour approach- es, I'm getting all excited.  So what do you think, is it --  -- just the 'Executive Committee' or could you guys use me?
Thanks, Quince.
'It's up to Joe'?  Those were his words?
He was interested.
What you then?
No, no.  I on holiday.
Don' be facety, woman.
Good morning, Mr. Parrish.
Good morning, Mr. Parrish.
What?
I was a world-class loser and she was a happy, little rich girl -- and for some reason she took me in.
'The deepest, darkest secrets --'?
Oh yes, you are one of my favorites.
When you put your mouth to his, Susan, it seems a frequent thing.
Yes --?
-- Could you?
Yes?
He must be tired -- this Bontecou thing --
...No.
More than you love peanut butter?
I love you in an evening gown.
Well, I don't know what else to say. It's a helluva party --
I hope you realize, Bill...in your office this morning, that was your time.
And what?
A 'deal'?
I guess so.
Make an exception?
-- I don't deserve this.  I'm still young, this is not my time --
That's what everybody says.
Would you like to sit down, Joe?
Uh-huh.
Okay.
Why did you go to the hospital?
You tell me, Bill.
'Spooning'?
You're violating the laws of the universe.
-- I have the feeling that, all in all, what I made this voyage for -- has served its purpose.
I love her, Bill.  She is all that I ever wanted, and I've never wanted for anything because I've never wanted anything before, if you can understand.
How perfect for you -- to take whatever you want because it pleases you.  It's not love --
Multiply it by infinity and take it to the death of forever and you will still have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.
Those were my words, Bill.
It's time to put this person where he belongs.
He is --
You are --?
That's me.
Are you giving me orders?
It requires competence, wisdom, experience -- all those things they say about you in testimonials -- and you're the one.
Time.
I'm sorry --
How's that, Quince?
Next week?
Quince, I've got confidence in you.
Eddie?
Yeah - Bill - How are you?  You okay?
Fine, fine.  Big doing up here.  Why are you still down here?
We're all here, Bill --
Drew told me.
You mean like you loved Mom?
Forget about me and Mom -- are you going to marry him?
Well, I wasn't going to say that --
What were you going to say?
You're not listening --
You're terrible.
We've met.
Uh - will that hold you, Joe?
Funny, I don't get that feeling. Maybe it's because you found out I'm Bill Parrish's daughter.
Raise away.
Then what is it?
Because I was sitting in a staff meeting, incredibly bored, my mind kept wandering and the only place it landed was -- Joe.
What a night.
You and 'Honey'?
My kid sister.  She just broke up with her boyfriend and she's thinking about dropping out of law school.
I'm sorry --
You'd give up what you want for the woman you marry?
No, it was so right it scares me.
Sure, I'll give you the name of a doctor.  ...And I don't want to examine you.
What's it like?
So how many rooms am I checked into in this dump?
Well, at least you're being honest about cheating me.
Leonard, it's Burt from the front desk.
Interested in buying one?
What the fuck are you doing here?
Wait! Did he tell you what I was bringing?
Sorry, I should have explained. You see, I have this condition -
So you have information for me?
Tell me about her again.
Because you like to remember her. I want to see you enjoy yourself.
It's isolated.
Guess I don't have to worry about him anymore.
Yes.
Kill him.
What happened?
Kill him.
My wife used to call me Lenny.
Did you?
What happened?
What do you think I am?! I'm not gonna kill someone for money.
Dying.
Who's your boyfriend?
My name's Leonard.							 *
Shut your mouth!
This is your car.
Yup?
So I see. It's good to see you. My name's Teddy.
Yeah, well I go on facts, not recommendations, okay?
I'm not gonna help you kill this guy, if that's what -
We probably ought to take his car, you know, teach him a lesson.
So was he scared?
Lenny, as a buddy, let me inform you. Your business here is very much finished. You're still here because of Natalie.
What sort of questions?
Like what?
I know, you investigated. Maybe you need to apply some of your investigative skills to yourself.
That's Sammy, not me! I told you about Sammy -
You know, when we found your guy and			   * killed him.  That's right, the real John G. Over a			  * year ago. I helped you find him. He's			  * already dead.							 *
You probably.							 *
No. You took them out.						  *
Your name's Teddy.
What cop?
About the Stevens family, I'm sorry.  I know you were close to them.
I was the kids' godfather.
And...?
Sal Maguda.
JosÃ© Yero changed-up the drop plan on us.  He's grabbed Gina.
...you'd be operating outside territorial United States.  Your badges do not count.  You have no authorization to carry weapons.  If you're busted, it could take a long time to get you re-patriated.  And there's no backup...  And you will share with them all your intel on Montoya...
I got to talk to my ADO...
Make it 35.
Put your guns on the table...  If we wanted you dead, you would no longer be drawing breath in Miami. We wouldn't have brought you all the way here.
Off a little alley with cobblestones.  Hemingway went there...
Havana?  Cubans don't like us or my business...
Were you born in Havana?
"Probable"...applies to an event that may be real.  Doesn't apply here.
I would say you're...  ...four percentage points away from a deal...
I forgot the napkins.
What's the best fortune you ever got?
A few more moments, still in this business.  Then I'd find you.
...in the morning.
Yero, by himself?
Sonny Burnett...this is my partner, Rico.
How 'bout this?  How'd Neptune know where to hit us?  Huh?  Whose Op sec's got a leak?  Yours?
What'd Neptune tell you?
Proof of life.  How do I know Mrs. Rico's alive?
So?
And we didn't come down here to audition.  Business auditions for us...  ...and know who we are and know they want their load run by us <u>before</u> Nicholas calls.
Then it don't work.
Where'd you go?
Havana, Cuba...?
...where you're makin' a move on the wife of Archangel de Jesus Montoya?
We're makin' moves on each other.
Yeah.  CIA-level stuff...
What's the point?  It's going down.
Eleven to seven he blows it.
Twenty on my man...
This is Agent James Fujima.
Okay.  What's up?
Who's the "we"?  There's you and there's us.  And all we got from you was bad intel.  "Low-level producer."  Yeah, right...
How will it stand up?
It's fucked up.  I'm sorry...
Break your encryption?  Hack your e- mail?  Employee databases? Somebody on the inside?
Who are you talking to?
Only African he ever "relocated" was a $2,000-an-hour Nigerian model for Gucci, and he got wounded when she took an NBA draft choice to the Super Bowl instead of him...
Yes.  What's up?
Okay.
Why?
It's all bullshit.  Jesus is out of communication in Fals de Iguazu. JosÃ© knows that...  Whatever he's going to do, he has to do it fast because he's acting on his own. And he will need a story.
Transshipment point is here at 17:00 hours on the 23rd.
Beg pardon, ma'am. I'm brand spanking new to this town, come from Houston, Texas, and hoping to get a look at the Statue of Liberty...
Don't know what line Morey's in, but myself now, fact is -- I'm a hustler.
Yeah?
I'm sorry. I thought you were -- never mind -- I've never actually been there, but let me see, you take the Seventh Avenue subway, I think, to the end of the line...
Okay. Never argue with a man.
Now take it. Go on.  Listen, where can I reach you? Cause I'm gonna make this right with you soon's I get me set up...
I'm inviting you. I mean if you're not located, I got a place. I'm inviting you, goddamit.
Well, I hope you know what you're in for. I'm a very dangerous person. Someone does me bad like you. If I caught up with you that night, there'd be one dead Ratso long about now. Hear?
Look at yourself, Joe, no offense, but frankly, you're beginning to smell. For a stud in this town that's a handicap.
Not bad -- for a cowboy -- you're okay, you're okay.
Did I say that? Did I?  It don't say nothing about you...
Tell her, Ratso.
And what?
I'm going to Florida, that's my only chance.
I'll find the money. If you just get me on the bus, that's all I ask.
Just when everything's going my way, you gotta pull a stunt like this.
I read it.
Thanks, Joe.
Gin's okay.
What you got me up here for?
Gonna be like money from home.
Instant V-goddam-D.
Sold. Let's go.
Getchmis olsun
Looks like a cheap hotel.
Dad...I'm...
About ten kilometers.
Two hundred dollars. It was my last two hundred.
What's your father do?
And you?
He wasn't even in the car?
How long?
Okay?
What time is it?
Goddamn Gastro's killing me.  Making me blind. Hey Billy!
I think I've been poisoned.
Susan - forget it. Go get us a seat on the plane. Now.
I make special tea for you, Hiyes, okay?  We've to live like brothers. We have to be in here together.
Not just any carbohydrates, mind you. It was like being on the receiving end of some kind of transcendent oral sex.  We should get a strobe on this thing. Maybe even a siren.
Show that to the station manager.  Tell him Leonard's gonna have his bubble-butt he don't have someone down here in ten.
Go left.  Go left again till you hit the fork... Then right again. You got that?
Oh, man, there you go again.
Leonard, listen.  I need to see if there's any nerve damage before we carry you back.  Look, I'm trying to help you here...
We're no leaving you!
This thing was the size of my fist, Peter!! That's off the charts!
Keep going. We'll tell you when to stop...
Honey, just leave it.
Fuck 'em.  They don't know what they're missing.
It didn't bite me.
We'll cover ourselves with this. They can mimic us-  we Goddam mimic them!
Don't touch it.  And for Godsakes, try not to sweat.  They can sense chemical changes...
Oh, come on, come on!
You go first. I'll be right below you.
Your arm, you can't...
C'mon...
Ah...
Watch your step, Siri.  Your grant could be on the line here.
What is it?
It bit you.
That's impossible.  Insects don't...
I could give you a couple of hundred pages of mine, and you could tell me what you think.
Sure.
Don't move now--wouldn't want to hurt this neck--  Well, the other afternoon I was on my way home, and there you were, leaving the Lodge, and I wondered why a literary genius would go for a drive when there was a big storm coming.
But what?
I can take it, go ahead.
It has no nobility.
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.
They had it at the store, Paul, there was a whole batch of them there. As soon as I saw it, I slammed my money down. I got the first copy.
I thought it was time you two should meet. Paul, say hello to my favorite beast in all the world, my sow, Misery.
I DON'T WANT HER SPIRIT! I want HER! And you MURDERED her!
And look what I've got for you. An electric razor so you can shave yourself now.
Work? You mean write? What in the world do you think I'd write?
You did great, except there's just one little thing--I can't work with this paper. It's Corrasable Bond, it smudges. Maybe you could go back into town and bring me some white, long-grained mimeo.
Are you sure? 'Cause if you want, I'll bring back the whole store for you.
Paul, you're dripping with perspiration, your color is very hectic--what have you been doing?
I'm sorry, Paul. This is all wrong, you'll have to do it over again.
I can't write this anymore.
To Misery.
The book is almost finished. Your legs are getting better. Soon you'll be able to walk. You'll be wanting to leave.
Paul, I know you've been out.
I'm glad you like it.
You don't know?
Work, work, work.  Virginia? When was that blizzard?
Just leave it, all right?
Oh, I like that tone.
People sure like those Misery books.
No, no, of course not. It's just that his daughter hasn't heard from him, and when he's got a book coming out, he usually keeps in touch. So when there was no word from him...
I don't think Mr. Sheldon likes for things to be out of the ordinary. Considering who he is and all, famous and all, he doesn't have airs. Drives the same car out from New York each time--'65 Mustang--said it helps him think. He was always a good guest, never made a noise, never bothered a soul. Sure hope nothing happened to him.
Answer me a couple things?
Did they win?
Great.
I thought you were over it.
I thought you were going to dinner.
Mmmm.
Nyah!
Fight a bit of a cold..
Beats fighting the flu, I'm here to tell you.
Than thirty-seven million pounds?  Not really.
She doesn't belong here, Sean.  Let her go.
Oh, Hunt, please! One can't hold Nyah responsible for her actions..
More like two-two point two million.
Ambrose obviously got these from Nekhorvich on the plane.
He should've have killed the virus in the incubation area..Nyah's exited the elevator on the same level as the lab.
No.  Just as if I'd like to.
- torque wrench.
At least you walked.
You're apologizing for me?  Quite the gentleman..
Not that it matter much but..I seem to recall you staying something like, 'I was hoping we could work together.'
Someone in possession of all the facts.  Are you telling me I have to do this?
How can you possibly?  I've got to get right on the plane.  I'm leaving now.
You don't trust me.
How's it going?  Everything okay?
Just like old times?
Have you met them?
Easy, easy, easy, shhh!
Twice.
Sean feels he hasn't done the job unless he leaves a lot of hats on the ground.
'Terrorists?'
She's got no training for this kind of thing.
Yes, I believe that's right.
But that leaves another seven or eight pints of Chimera.
Aren't you even curious?  About why she did it?
You'd like me to conduct my own debriefing.
He was quite a man.  Did he know before the end you two had succeeded?
..I'm fine..and you?
Ethan, I keep telling you there's not a chance of locating Nyah til I access the satellite and there's not a chance of doing that til I get this thing booted up and running!  How much time does she have left?
Well, the thought had occurred to me.  I needed Chimera in order to peddle Bellerophon.  For hero to be appreciated, you need a monster. Now that's not so difficult to understand, is it?  Look, time was a shot of penicillin could knock off every bloody bug in the zoo!  Not anymore!..have you any idea the R&D money it takes to float one little pissy boutique antibiotic that's barely effective against one strain of one bacterium?  If I couldn't makes money killing the microscopic little shits that are out there, you'd help me put one out there I can make on!..there it is.  I've confessed.  I, John C. McCloy, am in business to make money.  Lilly's making billions feeding Prozac to depressed dogs.  Pfizer doesn't even know where to put the money they're making on Viagra, and let me tell you that shit didn't do a thing for me even at twice the recommended dose, Jesus, who do I have to screw to get a a break!..now get me out of here, get me treated and let's go back to work!..
Kasimov, Kasimov, good that you called us.
C'mon, c'mon, tell the truth...c'mon.
Only four more cars.
And if we donÃ­t find him - weÃ­ll search the whole train again.
HeÃ­s putting on a show, Barnes.
Ethan, if you knew about Jim?..Why..
We got it.  On your feet.
You were in the car!
Who is "they?"
I sent the message to Max.  WeÃ­re on for tomorrow.
I can't tell you how sorry I am.  I know how much Jim in particular meant to you, Ethan.  Personally as well as professionally.
Yes.  I see your point.
How about if we just go quietly into the bathroom and I wash your mouth out with soap - you pathetic button down bureaucratic asshole.
Exactly, that's your job.  Tomorrow on the train, you can't let this list get out into the open.  What's the range of this thing?
You didn't tell 'em at the debriefing?
Really?  And you thought if you simply showed up I might give it to you?
The penny drops.  <u>You</u> are <u>not</u> Job.  Yes, Job is not given to quoting Scripture in his communications. And there was its tone -- aggressive but playful.  Job is not playful.  So you're something of a paradox.
Whether you like a paradox.  I want a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
It's quite out of the question.
Even so, I'm sure you could arrange an introduction.
Mm - Hmmm...
I don't have to tell you what a comfort anonymity can be in my profession -- like a warm blanket.  My deal with Job was subject to a successful boot scan.  Obviously it didn't pass muster.  Deal's off.
Simple game.  Four players.  Exfil opens the pocket --  -- cyber ops lifts the wallet.
Bank?
OK.  Taking Golitsyn's exit.  Jack, open the doors.
I don't communicate very well through a shroud.
A hundred and sixty-seven, I think it is. Take it all, if you want.  <u>After</u> this one.
Isn't he chairing the Armed Services hearing?
Not this week. This week he's flyfishing at the Oughterard Slough in County Kildare, with one of our best Irish guides.
He won't be back in a hurry?
IÃ­ve got a shadow.
A meeting tomorrow on the TGV, enroute to Paris.
ItÃ­s not working.
Who's dead?
Where you been?
Rose, pass the wine.
I don't know what you mean.
You look tired.
You did this once it didn't work out.
You've got to come. You've got to give me away.
And maybe that's why I had the Bad Luck. Maybe if you gave me away, and I got married in a church, in a wedding dress, instead of at the City Hall with strangers standing outside the door, maybe then I wouldn't had the Bad Luck I had.
What are you doing here?
You're married.
And then there is copper, which is the only pipe I use. It costs money. But it costs money because it saves money.
I'm going to marry him.
You are going to marry my brother?
When your husband get hit by the bus?
Stupid yourself.
Your blood.
I want to cut you open and crawl inside of you. I want you to swallow me.
You're mad at him, take it out on me, take your revenge on me! Take everything, leave nothing for him to marry! Hollow me out so there's nothing left but the skin over my bones. Suck me dry!
You don't get along with anybody!
Oh yes, oh yes you did! You've got those bad eyes like a gypsy! Why didn't I see it yesterday! Bad Luck! Is that all I'm ever gonna have? Why didn't I just pick up a stone and kill myself years and years ago? I'm gonna marry him!
What?
I'm telling you you can't.
Awful?
He didn't come!
No.
What?
Are you proposing marriage to me?
Right from the start we didn't do it right. Could you kneel down?
Why not?
So we'll sell the house.
I don't wanna talk about it.
Are you drunk?
No more he's not.
It was a miracle.
Then it was not a sin. But what was that second thing you said, Loretta?
I don't know.
Who was that?
That was my father-in-law, who has a wrong idea in his head. Listen, Johnny, there's a question I want to ask you. And I want you to tell me the truth if you can. Why do men chase women?
I'm sure she did.
Then why are you eating alone?
I'm not eating alone. Can I ask you a question?
Go ahead.
You're a little boy and you like to be bad.
I live in a one-bedroom apartment. What exactly does your husband do?
I feel great I got no sleep but I feel like Orlando Furioso!
Does wood sink in water?
...What?
The swallow may fly south with the sun, or the house martin or the plover seek warmer hot lands in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land.
Look! To maintain Velocity, a swallow needs to beat its wings four hundred and ninety three times every second.   right?
He knows of a cave ... a cave which no man has entered.
Well, who is your lord?
Well, I didn't vote for you.
NI!
Oh!
We shall say Ni! again to you if you do not appease us.
I command you, as King of the Britons to stand aside.
'Tis but a scratch.
You're a liar.
Victory is mine.  I thank thee O Lord that in thy ...
You are indeed brave Sir knight, but the fight is mine.
Stop that.
I am Arthur, King of the Britons.
You know my name?
I didn't know you were called Dennis.
... but a two-thirds majority ...
Shut up, will you. Shut up!
Come and see the violence inherent in the system. Help, help, I'm being repressed!
Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper.  I am not afraid.
That's easy!
Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper.  I am not afraid.
Bring out your dead!
Thanks very much.
Who's that then?
Did you kill all those guards?
Herbert.
Not ... to leave the room ... even if you come and get him.
Leaving the room.
Right.
Oh yes, of course!  I thought you meant him!  You know it seemed a bit daft me havin' to guard him when he's a guard ...
Er ... Sir Galahad... the Chaste.
Well ...
Camelot ...
Come Sir Galahad, quickly!
Well ... yes ... but I hadn't realised ...
He's come to rescue me, father.
They're all saying the word ...
What's he do?  Nibble your bum?
You don't tell Her Majesty how you feel.
I speak as I find, Archie.
She's hardly a full hamper herself.
Come on, man.  There's love and there's ...
I'm not sure I do, Archie.
Aye?  Then she's obviously not got enough to do.
So?  Someone'll send it on ahead.
Don't be an idiot!  You're in no fit state to go anywhere.
And when was the last time she put herself out for you?  Look, John, whatever she says to you now, in the end you're still a servant.
You watch your tongue.
What's your name?
Good man.  And is she all right?
Have you met Mr Lyle?  He's in sugar...?
I'm flattered you think so.
What did you say?
Whom you address.
Well, everyone's entitled to their opinion.
Brown's responsibilities are onerous enough already.  He has far too much to do without having to stay up all night waiting for you to go to bed. The smoking-room will be closed and the lights put out at twelve o'clock.
Do you?
I am a blank sheet.
You sent for me.
It's nothing.
Mr Brown.
Archie.
Yes.  That will be company for you.
What?
I am told so.
Who by?
They're ready now.
I was told you were in a fight.
Someone has to look after you.  It could've been someone.  It was before.
I stay here because I am happy.  Is that such a terrible crime?
Surely, you're not suggesting we dispense--
A fine choice, sir.
Dear oh dear.
Well, no rest for the wicked, Henry.
Just them?
Lord Clarendon arrives, by invitation, at eleven o'clock, followed at twelve by a picnic in the grounds to celebrate Princess Alice's birthday. Dispatches, as usual, at two.  The Chancellor writes to say that, by happy coincidence, he will be in Cowes for the weekend.  He asks if Your Majesty might grant him an audience.
Why?
We stayed a little longer than expected with Mr and Mrs Grant.  It was most agreeable.
Who told them that?
What do they want?
What do you mean?
You've got your ten levels, right? Here they are...  Each level has an exit, only remember, the exits aren't always what they seem.  First one's The Blood Red Sky, then you've got The Blue Desert, Tower of Ghosts, Kingdom of the Blind...  On each world you have to find a golden key and you've only got so much time to do it in.  If you're too late, The Screamer comes.
Thanks, Albert.  Think you could print up those schematics?
We're having some problems with ARCADE...
What's the question mark?
Did you play ARCADE last night?
Hello?
No, in person.  Now.
What do you mean by "weird"?
Can you turn off the game?
I'm in the middle of it...
Alex, I think you're freaking out. Greg's gone, I'll give you that.  And maybe he's in trouble.  But it's not ARCADE that's doing it...
Because I didn't know where else to go.
It's not this weird.  It'll make sense. Everything gets weird this late anyway, right?
Give me a break, Alex.  What are we going to tell them?  Excuse me, officer, but there's some sort of electronic monster loose in the phone lines.  I'd think twice about calling any of those 976 numbers...
You realize that in order to do that, we'd actually have to play the game.
Jesus Christ!
And what if something happens to you? Am I suppose to go in after you alone?!
I already have a boyfriend, Nick.
Christ...no time...
I'm okay.
Come on.  We'll hit Dante's after school, try the game out, maybe get some dinner.
Mom?  You're alive...
It means she's screwed up.
Give her a chance, will you?
What did you say?
And getting stranger. Where do I meet this Cowboy? I mean do I have to ride out to the range?
I'm just offering a place to stay.
Whatever.
One.
Number 17.
No...I need to sleep.
Well...  what do you think about then? I mean...  well what do you think about?
I don't know.
You don't remember anything else?
"So... surprise"...
It sounds kind of nice ... being somebody brand new.
Okay, so you had a dream about this place. Tell me.
Sammy thinks the Caddy had stopped along the shoulder ... man up the road said he saw two cars drag racin'...then you got that blind corner.
Yeah ... and they both use the same address.
So man, that's unheard of ... an accident like that ... who coulda foreseen that.
Not a coke or anything?
What's going on ?
Why should we trust you ?
Leave him, he's dead.
Why don't you tell us what the fuck is going on ?
Hey ! Hey ! I'm talking to you !
I'M NOT BOFFING MATTHEW !
So you're telling me you were set up ? I knew something was wrong.
We drown.
I was lured by all the money and I truly did convince myself that what I did was for justice. Since then, McCay has wanted to put anyone he can down here.
But how do you know if the people are guilty ?
I do a very thorough background check. I go through police files, personel files, anything.
So you may have been duped this whole time. Killing innocent people, that must make you feel ..., how does it feel ?
You didn't think about it did you ? I read your file. It said you had a nervous breakdown.
I wanted to let his family know....
You okay ?
Hey buddy, thanks for the help back there !
Give me one good reason why I don't plug you right here, right now ? 
That's nice.  I think I lost my wallet.
I'd get out of the water if I were you.
You okay ?
I didn't think he'd make it past Scraps.
Here. Am I ever going to get to run the controls for one these capers ?
So ?
Matthew lives on the Upper West Side, kinda posh for a temp don't you think ?
Why don't you just stop fucking around and just die !
If you want, I can fire you and have someone else who has the balls terminate these worthless people. Which will it be ?
Zachory ! My boy, how goes the carnage down on 44 ?
Of course.
I don't believe Ol' Bruce is having as much fun with this as he once did. He still insists on the "guests" being of the more nefarious type.
John, sir.
Zach, my boy ! How is tonights adventure going ?
Might I ask why you no longer work for the mob ?
What are you looking for ? A blow job ?
So who are these people with the Boss ?
Look ! Look !
What the ... ?
Really ? On a date ?
Yes.
Hi. I brought some wine.
If they're so rich, why are you working at all ?
Would that impress you ? I mean you're the kinda woman that probably has Ferrari written all over your personal ad.
Not now, Mom.
I think I'm very quickly getting over my phobia of public urination.
Are you okay ? Any holes ? I mean aside from the one's that nature gave you ?
My mother took this course with you at UCLA...&quot;The Foundations of Poetic Thought&quot;.
I'm not supposed to talk to strangers, not even nuns.
Well you know what I mean.
Don't do that, you've got the whole garage.
Oh yeah, right-between the power mower and the weed killer.
I already bought a ticket.
Bye Dad, I'll miss you.
Thanks, I needed that.
I'll be back in 137 hours.
Ask him if he needs a good tuba player.
Uh huh, a boy, you've got a new brother.
Oh, Shell, that's ridiculous, where are my needle nosed pliers?
Never heard of him. 
We have this school assignment to write about someone we never met and I chose my mother. She was born in Los Angeles and since my uncle Phil moved out here I came in to visit him and then I looked at her high school yearbook and...  and I called a few people and one guy said that she went to UCLA, another guy said that I should call Hillary Mitchell so....
I told you it was a long story.
It's Kevin, I don't want him to see me.
What's the matter?
So she had you in jail, in Russia?
Hello.
What can I do for you?
Ehh...I'm staying at the chateau and the guy who runs the garage there said that you're the best Jag people in town...so uhm.
I guess you have.
O.K. Thank you very much.
Your mother?
Make that sixty and I'm docking your allowance for two weeks.
Thanks....
Yearbooks always set you out for disappointment, I want mine to say: Nick probably won't amount to much, so don't be surprised if you never hear anything about him again. Can we go?...It smells like someone left their gym bag in here.
I don't think anybody should change their names, that way you can always find them when you need them.
I think it's cool.
This isn't just a mood ring.
Maybe it'll fit my pinkie.
What are you doing? You can't go in there!
Montgomery Clift, wait 'till I tell Shelly.
I'm afraid your feet won't fit in there.
Like what?
No problem.
Who cares? Rose, tell him we have an arrangement.
Sounds like you have a fear of commitment, Uncle Phil.
So does that mean that you sleep here every night?
Then you'll be all set.
I was commenting on your hair.
Oh, are you a hairdresser?
...It's all in the hands really. You know you have nice hands, you operate?
Assuming the baby's a &quot;Supremes&quot; fan.
They're enormous, I know.
Is there milk in them already?
Oh, but I'm not due to have the baby for another six weeks or so.
It would be fantastic.
Yeah, to play with his DOLLS.
Hey, you didn't pay me!
Okay, I know you've suffered a terrible loss, and there's really nothing anyone can do to comfort you, but I urge you to focus on the times you had with the camper, the trips you took, the sights you saw, those days are gone now, but they'll live on in your heart forever.
Oh.. Oh.. Oh no?? Oh?
The boss is watching us...
You are perfectly healthy.
Ohh, oh sure it's no big deal, you see all my former clients will eventually die, and all your clients used to be alive, so they have something in common.
This was the Reverend Porter's wife, you have her looking like a two dollar hooker.
She was raised in a funeral home, she knows a thing or two about it.
Would you like to come in and see my house? Just for a minute.
Yeah.
Want to what?
Kiss me.
Yes.
It's for Shelly's famous potato salad.
Danny that's a real _bonehead_ thing to say!
Can we see it from the back yard?
Yep, there they are... They always look the same every year...
Stop hiding Harry, you run Harry. When I first came here, the idea of working with dead people, didn't exactly thrill me, but when I saw a family lived here, I thought, &quot;if I'm living without a family, at least I can work with one, and maybe once in a while i'll be invited in for supper.&quot;
VADA!
That's a lot of money for a little girl.
Dad?
Why?
Dad, didn't you say you needed prunes REAL bad?
When?
When??
Vada, something happened to Thomas J last night, he stepped on a beehive.
In the garage.
Nothing, I'm dressing.
Hi.
It's okay. Mr. Bixler, I finished all the books for summer reading.
No. Well, guess i'll go home and finish off War &amp; Peace.
I wrote a poem too.
Why do you think she says that?
Hi.
Can we look around in your camper?
I would.
Have you ever tried any?
Hey, I thought I recognized you two, hi Vada.
I don't think that that roller coaster agreed with your bad stomach. You know Vada you have to watch what you eat here, I remember one time I went to a carnival with my cousins David and Frank, and they both ate hot dogs, and the next day they came down with nephritis.
I won, I won!!!
NO!
Well he just left, what's wrong?
How old are you?
Thomas J?
I'm allergic to it.
I knew he wouldn't come.
I'm gonna be an acrobat when I grow up.
It'll bleed.
If I do it, can we go?
Hey look at this!
What?
What do you want? My mom will skin me alive if she finds I'm out here.
What do you want it for anyway?
Got it!
Wow, was it a decoder ring?
Then go home, baby.
No, I'm hiding out.
Well when you get older, you just have to.
Uh huh.
No.
Well, let's spit on it.
I should look different.
Which is everyone you couldn't get in.
Needs salt.
You like her.
Tell him you love him.  With all your heart.
Digger and George are with family in the Hamptons until Monday morning.  Brevity is even more in order than usual.
It depends.  If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento, we could start there. Or Phoenix.  Or depending on Indiana- Clevel...
A trademark move, don't touch it.
Gold dog collars? They don't have dogs.
Yeah, well, lots of couples are imcompat...
I had this crank call?  From some guy who thinks he saw her? I said, what would a bride be doin', on her wedding...
Under the circumstances.  Charmed to know you, Jules.
Julianne, reading my son-in-law's mail, is not something...
I thought Michael was picking me up.
And she's all wrong for me!
Please come, please.
What's the sec...
Every day.  She makes the bed.
What, leaving school...
I mean Walter owns the Sox, cable sports... most girls in her spot would be angling to get Daddy to offer you some juicy gig right here in t...
I've been thinking a lot the last couple days.  About us, actually.
Well.  There's a lot of memories to choose from...
And I was thinking this could be our last time.  Alone.  Together. You know?
I wouldn't know.  I never had that many first thoughts.
So we heard it... like, right that... that first...
No accents today.
It's no big deal, she just gave you the wrong keys that's s...
This thing means that much to y...
What happened?
She denied it.  Said I was crazy and paranoid.
Michael...
This is her family and her fault.
I was so confused, so conflicted, so... unstable.
... your one chance for true happiness?
Actually.  Lower.  I am the fungus that feeds on pond scum.  Lower. The layer of mucous that cruds up the fung...
Almost three.
Course, if it's later rather than sooner, I'd hate to be you at six o'clock.  You've got a lot of explaining to...
The kiss.  May be hard.  For you to explain.  Because the only fear she really has, is...
And to m...
Fine.  I'm an insensitive, chauvinist asshole, and you're well rid of m...
Reverend Dyer, this is Kimberly's somewhat butch maid of honor...
Well, that just happened that time.
What do you have to buy?
No.
I called Connie and she said not to worry, She'll fill in for you.
Oh, Barnett, I'm so sorry.
Honey, it's okay... How do you feel now?
You going today?
Not a thing, Barnett, really. I need a little information. But, ah, it can wait.
Nothing; Barnett. It's my job.
How much?
Need to have you check these out before he goes on that Walker benefit.
Yes. I was in my Sophomore year at Harvard.
What is a turkey shoot.
I didn't think it would. She's calling herself L.A. Joan this- week. Last week it was Dakota. Guess if you have to change your name a state's as good as anything.
Wrecks.
Mom?
Oh, well, I knew that before you- even left. I told you, 'Kenny, that old Nash won't make it down the road.'  But you had to go.
Next you'll be sick.
Bet the sheets are grey.
Does their hair fall out?
I've been a Little dyspeptic.
Okay. I'll be talking to you.
When I was little, in church.
Yes, it is --
How long have you been with them?
Are you a close friend of Haven's?
No, mostly his wife's. She's in Paris, France, right now. My husband Delbert is real friendly with him. Delbert's in law. Does work for him.
I'm not sure. Where?
Yes.
Oh.
How old are you?
All I need is fifteen minutes a night.
What?
Yes.
What for?
Where are you going?
Come on back to bed.
I'm Opal.
Why?
Pleasure
You go to school together?
Well, I really think he's got a chance.
Oh yea -- There has never been a better time for something new.
Where are you from?
You always live there?
Is that good?
If you're serious. Being serious is real important.
You think it will?
When you study the martial arts, they give out belts that come in different colors to signify what level you're at in your training. Am I correct on that point?
What was the color of Tim's belt?
Jeet Kune Do...Now I did some research on that form of fighting, and I found out that Jeet Kune Do was a style developed by Bruce Lee. Did you know that?
Point of fact, weren't Tim's hands registered as lethal weapons?
Thank you, sir.
The public loves you Jack...You don't mind if I call you Jack, do you?
...one night I was asleep, and a noise wakes me up. I thought, 'Oh shit, somebody's broken in.' I didn't own a gun, so I go into the living room with a fucking umbrella. Okay, it turned out to be nothing. God made the noise. Who knows?
How come you never talk?
Yeah. Ya see, I ordered that special.
How is it?
The episode we did on Mickey and Mallory was one of our most popular ones.
Yes.
Yeah, it's pretty hard to beat the king.
Mickey, how do you feel about cross- examining Grace Mulberry?
Okay now, before we get started here, there's a few things we have to get clear about.
Where's it parked?
Wait! You can't kill me. Mickey and Mallory always leave somebody alive to tell the tale.
Let's make a little music, Colorada.
Roger, enough with the fucking donuts! What did I tell you. Stop bothering Mickey, and get behind your nagra.
Wayne Gayle.
They're real Goddamn good. They'll be there for when ya need 'em. Where are they?
By taking away our legs. Now we have to fight harder to get ahead than anyone else you'll find in this gym. Probably the whole city. They gave us the fighting spirit. Before this happened I was content. Now I'm pissed off. Now I'm half a man and I've got to work like the devil to get whole again.
How's everything coming, Mr. Gayle?
It sure is.
Well, just what the hell do you expect me to do?
Wayne, if it was anybody else---
What are we talking about?
Could we go with you and film it?
It sure is.
Fill her up?
Who're you tellin' to get, boy?! You watch it, or there'll be some dyin' done 'round here!
Want to talk to you.
I hear you're tryin' to organize this place!
I still don't know what you're talkin' about.
Uh-huh. Well, this ain't the railroad. Now what's all this talk about stickin' together?
What d'you think?
Thanks.
His profession?
Okay.
No. I'm new in town.
Oh yeah?
In Birmingham.
No.
You don't think much of yourself, do you?
Hell!
Well, they seem just like everyone else.
Well, I don't get on so well most places.
That's why you come back, huh?
What d'you mean?
Well, either we're gonna hit the hay or get married. Now you don't want to hit the hay, and I don' want to get married.
You have some very primitive ideas, don't you?
At first it was real strange. Hell, Japan is a long ways from Alabama. Really got under my skin, though. Almost didn't come back.
Four.
What?
Hey, watch out! Guess you want a house full of pickaninnies too, huh?
You still didn't answer my question.
How would you like to have a baby, Duff?
Don't look so scared.
We can always do that, Duff.
I don't think that'll happen.
Okay.
Like a home, for one thing.
You gonna sit at home the rest of your life? Jesus!
I'm Duff.
I asked you somethin', boy!
Jesus, I told you to watch it!
What did you say, boy?!
How come you all ain't sendin' them to the same school?
Oh yeah?
Yeah. All a colored woman wants is your money.
Wouldn't do for one of your people to sue at a time like this.
Better now.  Where 'you at?
I'm sorry, Danny. Time's up. I'11 do the girl, then me. I don't give a fuck.
My man's coming to get my ass out of here. That's good enough for me.
What are you doing in here?
We'll match your rate just prior to your... accident. One half in advance.
I'll think you'll find everything in working order. Molly's just having a little fun.
There are fifteen toxin sacs bonded to the lining of your main arteries. They're dissolving, Case... slowly, but they're definitely dissolving. You have just long enough to do the job.
Anything rated higher than a P.C.'s got a hard-wired suicide switch. It'll self- destruct.
I cannot tell a lie. Sorry.
Could be your A.I.'s calling card.
Yeah, well it's working.
That's nice, but we can't dodge this kind of heat for long.
Ah, Herr Case. And how is the artiste tonight?
I don't have a girl.
You're pleasant tonight.
Yeah. That was me.
What elders?
Maelcom... Do you think there's a hell for computers?
Those guys couldn't even find their own dicks with tweezers and a magnifying glass.  Tell you what, Bro. I'll make you a deal. I help you nail this A.I., you gotta do me one favour.
The run is tomorrow night, Dixie. Can you crack its ice pattern?
Take a look. Son of a bitch won't feel a thing until it's too late.
Wait... You hear that?
I had to limit your options.
I hope you can show more than you did when you let the Yakuza butcher Linda Lee.
Why should I want to meet him.
What's my end?
... a friend of mine's gonna get herself killed. I need my clip.
Since when do sprawl doctors know more about nerve rehab than the Japanese?
Couple of months.
The first fun's bound to be rough. It that read out fluctuates more than ten points... just pull this out. But if the EEG flatlines, don't touch anything.
The point is, if you unplug me when I'm flatlines, I'm history. I got no way back.
Surviving, darling. It's my specialty. Only this time I'm doing it my style. I've beaten him, you know.
Yeah - isn't it amazing that those guys are our same age? I mean, they just seem so much younger, you know.
Just so you know, I think they recalled these cars in 1974.
Petty good.
What's that?
I had a lunch break so I thought I'd come by and see you. Your teacher is a fox!  Why don't we discuss that after class. But the burning is totally normal.  Oh look. Class is over already.
The girls threw them at me in the locker room.
Hi!
That'll teach me to wear white after Labor Day.
Hey Josie- who did Archie date Betty or Veronica?
Well, excuse me for caring about words.
They don't have to be in the office Christmas show?
You don't think I can grab bulls' balls?
But I don't want it straightened out.
Uhh, no.
Rufus.  But I don't even know where you live.
God, I can't do this.
No it's not. Guys name their penises.
Okaaaay....  That car's going to bankrupt you.
See!
I'm not going to college, Jos. And I'm not playing anymore baseball. This is my life.
How can you just give up like that? You had a real shot at playing college ball and you let one case of mono stop everything. Don't you want more? To move out of Mom and Dad's? Pay your own bills?
You can't just "borrow" my car for a couple of months! That's like ten years in Bambi life!
Do you remember high school?
Are mom and dad here?
And a gymnast!
Not the happiest of souls.  "Art is a form of catharsis, and love is a permanent flop."
Hey, Josie, hold on.  You've been hiding something from me.
That's what makes you interesting.  As a teacher.
Wait, I was going to tell you--
But now you don't have to--
Yes.
Billy Prince is asking you to prom.
Why?
Kirsten, that bran muffin has like 75 fat grams.
Well, a ball player.
<i>                      Jack said we should work together.</i>
You're mine, you know.  I made you.
I'm grown up now.  I have to leave some time.
I can't help it.
Oh, God, Jesse - I know you're there! Stop him!
I'll kill you now.
You got a problem with me, Grady?
What are you doing here?
You're fucked in the head.
Yeah, yeah, sure.
I think it's sad...
Look, you got electricity in your body, right?
What is this place?
I wish you'd talk to me.  We can figure it out, you know.  We can figure it out together.
Huh?
All of them.
I'm serious.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to get to the club.
The maid packed a suitcase.  Teresa!  Teresa?
What?
If Simms catches you in here after lights out, she'll chew my ass ragged.
Do you still...see each other?
You like gymnastics?
You did it the other night.
Freddy?
They sedated me.  We're stuck here till it wears off.
Can't be good news coming from you.
The whole wing's devoted ot this program.  That's your office.
A little basic, but nice.
Fucked up chromosomes, man.  Think about it.  Their parents all dropped acid in the Sixties.
But nightmares are the common thread?
I've had some experience with pattern nightmares.
You're late.
All right.  Then let's eliminate the symptom for the time being.
I can't believe I just did that.
I'm running out of answers. A patient sleepwalks out of a security ward up to a tower with no access.  A girl, alone in a room, dies by jumping six feet straight up into a television set. Nothing makes sense anymore.
The truth.
What are we going to do?
The question is, what happened to Freddy's body?
Who is he?
Okay, straight talk only in here.
Mary Helena.
I could've saved them.
A young girl on the staff was accidentally locked in here over the holidays.  The inmates managed to keep her hidden for days.  She was raped...hundreds of times. When they found her, she was barely alive...and with child.
My God.
That girl was Amanda Krueger.  Her child --
I'm Will Stanton, and um...I've had a little accident, as you can see.
Uh, fourteen.
Hi.
I forgot my bag.
Right.  No one.  I mean, I'll tell myself sometimes but... don't worry -- I won't believe it.
You played it pretty cool here, waiting for three days to call.
Ahm -- well -- we would have liked to -- but it was difficult, obviously, being set in space.
Well, it was nice to meet you. Surreal but nice.
You'll have to prove it.  This is a great brownie and I'm going to fight for it.  State your claim.
And the pregnancy thing -- is that to do with the accident?
Busy tomorrow?
No, I didn't.
There's no 'unless.'  No one has said "whoopsidaisies" for fifty years and even then it was only little girls with blonde ringlets.
It's a disease I've got -- it's a clinical thing.  I'm taking pills and having injections -- it won't last long.
She left me.
No, that's fine.  It's not often one has the opportunity to adios the plates of a major Hollywood star.  It was a thrill for me.  How is he?
I don't know.  It got to the point where I couldn't remember any of the reasons I loved him.  And you... and love?
Yes -- start in L.A. on Tuesday.
Would you like me to take you through your lines?
'Very well, captain -- I'll pass that on straightaway.'
Damn.  'And Wainwright...'
Yup.
You have a stunt bottom?
No seriously.  I mean, they're just breasts.  Every second person in the world has got them...
But... they're odd-looking.  They're for milk.  Your mum's got them.  You must have seen a thousand of them -- what's the fuss about?
How do you think I'm doing?
That's spectacularly unfair.
Now stop.  Stop.  I beg you -- calm down. Have a cup of tea.
This is certainly... ah...
You disappeared.
Thank you.  Shall I...
... can I just say 'no' to your kind request and leave it at that?
Thank you, Bernie.  Hey -- nice surprise, or nasty surprise?
Liar.  She hates surprises.  What are you ordering?
What's your name?
Miracles do happen.
Does the girl have a name?
He's cooking guinea fowl?
Do you want to stay?
Bernie.
If anyone gets in our way -- we have small nuclear devices.
Right, right.  Ahm -- did you enjoy making the film?
But Ringo Starr doesn't look anything like Topol.
Right -- want another one?
I think you have forgotten...  what an unusual situation you have here -- to find someone you actually love, who'll love you -- the chances are... always miniscule.  Look at me -- not counting the American -- I've only loved two girls in my whole life, both total disasters.
There's an understatement.  There are dead people on better form.
Ahm, look this is a very odd situation.  I'm a friend of Anna Scott's -- and she rang me at home the day before yesterday -- and left a message saying she's staying with you...
No, sir.
That's right -- I'm at last going out on a date with the great Janine and I just want to be sure I've picked the right t-shirt.
Yes -- she might think you don't have true love on your mind.
Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.
There never will be, you know, unless you actually clean your clothes.
Two?  That's it?
Right.  No one else?
Well, it was genuinely bizarre... she said, hi -- it's Anna -- and then she said, call me at the Ritz -- and then gave herself a completely different name.
What?
You're welcome.  Did you find them?
Oh my God...  Hello.
Yes.
And you get on very well.
Spike.  For God's sake -- she's in trouble -- get a grip.
I suppose I might have told one or two people down the pub.
I was in luh-love with her.
N-n-n-n-duh-duh-duh-pl-pl-pl-pl-muh muh-muh...
Pardon me, ma'am, can I ask you somethin'?
That's all right, Miss Pilbow, if Mister McMurphy does not wish to take his medication orally, he may...
Please understand, the schedule has been set up for a delicately balanced reason that would be thrown into turmoil by a switch of routines.
Let me pose a question to the group: do any of you feel that Mister McMurphy is perhaps imposing his personal desires on you too much?
I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, I count only eight.
Welcome back.
Yes, Miss Ratched?
Please see to Mister Bromden.
Yeah, that'll do for openers!
A bus?
'K-Kay, M-Mack!
Hey, Cheswick! Wake up!
It's the questions she asks.
What? What?
And if you persist in your ways, they can always ship you over to Medical Surgery.
Is that your sense of humor or are you tryin' to say somethin'?
What's the use! Hooee! It'd do you birds some good just to get a little exercise lifting your arms to vote!
Twenty-five dollars.
So why are you talking to him?
It doesn't help him.
Ya owe me twenty-five bucks.
Time in!  Hold it! Time out!  I said Harding out!
I'm the coach!
Hey, Harding, wake me in an hour.
No!
Right!
Jesus God...
Doc, what can I tell ya?
How are you feeling?
I'm afraid not.
'Kay, Mac!
Yeah, we'll miss breakfast!
Well, you boys finish it up an' climb back into your beds. 'Kay?
Okay, Mack!  Whoowe, Candy girl, are we in an insane asylum or ain't we?
Hit me!
Yes, sir, it's a mighty nice fall day...
I'm sure you will.
Huh?
Hey, Sam, bet ya two bucks ya lose.
Ya fuckin' coon, you're not on the ward now!
We got your black ass now, Washington, wanna bet another twenty?
I want those men put back to bed, Mister Turkle!
I thought so.
No, she wasn't my sister.
You didn't have that with you before.  Prima non l'aveva con se.
My friend has lost her fucking mind...
No, really.  What's she doing?
No.
We found each other, didn't we?
Let's face it.  Sooner or later we all die.
Ask her if she knows how I might reach him?  If she has a telephone number?
Yeah, but, what if this guy lived a billion, trillion years ago? Like, what if he was a cave man, and now he's dead?
Don't worry, it's a long story, but I know who he is.  I know where to find him.
Lots of history.  For example, did you know, according to legend, this coastline used to harbor Sirens?
Why can't you just tell me?
Yes?!  To be married, I suppose.
He's safe.
What?
Fine.  Okay.  Forget me.  Leave me out of it.  But don't go throwing your life away on somebody you don't love.
The guy at the hotel told me he always wears a gold medallion, and usually has a book or magazine with him.
Please.  I need to know.
Where are you going?  Just-- out of curiosity...
Nice dress.
What?...
Say, I saw where they had motor boats for rent down in the harbor. Why don't we all go for an evening cruise around the bay?
No.  I mean yes, I'm not.  I decided to call it off.  Well, actually, it was kind of mutual.
Reptilian swine.  There's no such thing.  Reptiles aren't swine.
Yes.  I'm crazy.  You have driven me crazy.  No one in their right mind would go to this much trouble to win over someone as insane as you.  Did it ever, even for one second, occur to you how much work it was to set all this up?  How many arrangements had to be made? How many players had to be coordinated?
Very funny.
Really?...
Aren't you going to tell me who you are?
Sure.
Really?
Is everything okay?
I wish you didn't have to go so early.
Look how big it makes me look.  I look like an Alp.
But what?
Oh, I don't know.  I guess it's just not quite the way I always thought it was going to be.  You know, like in the movies.
It was my New Year's resolution to overcome it.
How hard can it be?  I'll land there, I'll go to his hotel, I'll introduce myself, and--
Yes.  Cathy Lee Crosby stayed here.
Just once more, so you'll be sure to know what to look for.
So?
So what's in a name?  I wanna join him.  I don't see why we can't join him.
Oh my God.  Where?
Faith.  So far you've trailed the man halfway around the globe.  At this point, I don't think another fifteen feet is gonna tip the scales.
So, you've had a little bad luck.
No.  No, you go ahead.
You sure you'll be okay?
I'm sure.  And Kate, thank you for coming.  Thank you for being such a good friend.
It means you're a completely worthless excuse for a human being, and the fates have all conspired to make you miserable.
No one's perfect, Kate.
Maybe I can change him.
Maybe if I kiss him I'll feel it.
Kate.
Giovanni, I want to thank you.
No, why?
And we didn't have to bring another present?
Not only is it tacky, it's exploitation.
We're all desperate for the money, doll.  That's what made this country great.  Back me up on this Candy, am I right?
Don't call me doll, Larry.  I hate it when you call me doll.
What?  You know him?
It was an emergency.  I only lied that night because it was the only way I knew to stop her.  I knew if I didn't, I'd never see her again.
And then I saw her.  And all I know is, when I looked in her eyes I saw something... light.  And life and passion and yearning.  And something else I can't even put my finger on, something I'd never seen before--
That's the guy you've been waiting for all these years?
Thanks.
He just got a call from "Mr. Upstairs." Something's gone wrong. He's plenty hot.
If I talk too loud it's the fault of the nuns.
And what in blazes have the nuns got to do with it?
What gives with our boy tonight, Charley? He ain't himself.
When he got up and chased them they thought it was a dead man coming after them.
After what we been hearing about your brother, I thought your throat'd be kind of dry.
This girl and the Father got their hooks in him so deep he doesn't know which end is up anymore.
So do I, Charley. For your sake.
You know, the boys are getting rather interested in your future.
Sure, that's all right when you're a kid, but you'll be pushing thirty pretty soon, slugger. It's time you got some ambition.
Yeahâ€ yeahâ€ I guess I doâ€ but there's a lot more to this whole thing than I thought, Charley.
Don't say that!
I tell you, Charley, I haven't made up my mind!
It wasn't him!  It was you, Charley. You and Johnny. Like the night the two of youse come in the dressing room and says, "Kid, this ain't your nightâ€ we're going for the price on Wilson." It ain't my night. I'd of taken Wilson apart that night! I was readyâ€ remember the early rounds throwing them combinations. So what happensâ€ This bum Wilson he gets the title shotâ€ outdoors in the ballpark! â€ and what do I getâ€ a couple of bucks and a one-way ticket to Palookaville.  It was you, Charley. You was my brother. You should of looked out for me. Instead of making me take them dives for the short-end money.
Why Edie, Iâ€
They're waiting for him to walk in.
I'll get home all right now.
Aah, he's a bottlebaby, he talks to himself, the joke of the neighborhood.
A teacher! Dong!!!  You know I admire brains. Take my brother Charley. He's very brainy. Very.
Man, you were a mess!
I'd better go in.
You don't mind yourself at all, do you.  Joey used to race pigeons.
I don't know.
No thanks... .
I went pretty good for a while, didn't I, Al? Butâ€ I didn't stay in shapeâ€ andâ€  â€”I had to take a few dives.
A dive? You mean, into the water?
Gee, thoughts! Alla time thoughts!  You really believe that drool?
Hisâ€ racket?
And if you don't?
Iâ€ I'd like to, Edie, butâ€  â€”there's nothin' I can do. Edie feels subdued, ashamed at breaking down. She rises, and in a low voice saysâ€
All right, all right.. I shouldn't 've asked you.
What are you crying for?
Okay, get in hot water. But don't come hollerin' to me when you get burned.
It's true.
Edie... Edie... ..
You?
I don't want to hurt Charleyâ€ I don't want to hurt you...
Thatâ€  â€”word again! Why do you keep saying conscience, conscience... .
Get away from me.
I'll take it out of their skulls.
Edie.
Pop, I'm not ready to go back yet.
I'm not trying to tell you he's Little Lord Fauntleroy.
You are likeâ€
Edie. The Commission. Your subpoena. I know you got a subpoena.
Your gun.
Give me that gun.
Father, one thing you got to understand. On the dock we've always been D 'n D.
You still call it ratting?
Down to the wire?
Yeah. My own bloodâ€ and they sell me out for a lousy betâ€ I had it in me to hit the top andâ€  Boy, if I wanted to, the things I could tell you about them guysâ€ 
Looping right! I never swung wild. I was strictly a short puncherâ€ hooksâ€ over 'n underâ€  â€ whop-whop!
Raise a hand to me and... .
... .and you'll tell Johnny Friendly.
Jimmy, suppose I knew something, say a mug somebody put on somebody... .  You think I should turn him in?
Yeahâ€ us Golden Warriors.  You're a good kid, Jimmy, a good tough kid. We stick together, huh, kid?
No advice. Just whiskey.
You ought to go home and take care of thatâ€
Hey, Skinsâ€  --get away with that sheet metal all right?
Stow the receipt. I'll take the cash.
Forty-five bills.
Iâ€ I was just on my way up, Johnny.
I thought you were gonna keep an eye on that church meeting.
Oh, he did. Half an hour later a certain Timothy J. Nolan went into secret session with the Commission and he did all the talking.
You want to know somethin'â€?
You know what I mean. Leave her alone.
Go on, beat it!
Yeah, yeahâ€ Here's half a buck, go have yourself a ball.
I can't believe itâ€ a small fortune.   You can't buy meâ€ you're still a bum!  'Bye, Edie. Lord have mercy on Joey. 
You see, Kayo, the good Lord watches over us after all.
You think one bottle's enough for all them toasts?
Leave her alone, you fiend!
Leave her alone, I tell you!
But there're so many wonderful things to write about, Bob.
Don't let them hear you.
The ropes are coming loose.
Nothing is worth your life.
My guess is if we don't take the chance pretty soon, we're not going to have much life left anyway.
Yes I feel it in my bones.
I should hope not.  I hate you!
That sudden?
Yes, that sudden.  If it weren't for you we wouldn't be hunting for an old cemetery on a night like this.  It's all your fault.
A situation easily remedied.
As I said, a worshipper of snakes, and of smoke, and flames.
Yes, yes yes I know all that.
I suppose most of the others will have to wait for their judgement until after the next full moon.
I understand, Master
Oh, if there is only time!
The time...is short.
Have we in some way made you angry, Master?
Then it is some service you desire of us.
Ahh, good.  Then I will see them.  Dismiss the rest.
No. No! No!
Did you do something to get us into trouble again?
Didn't you tell me one-time calls aren't monitored?
What happened to Mandrake the Magician?
What're you talking about?
You do the sawing of the box in half trick with you inside?
But you know what I'm talking about, don't you?  About Glenn, don't you, and the second car?
Why not?
I talk to the guy you work for, Emil. He tole me your number and where you live.  See, I'm looking for an assistant and would like to speak to you.
I'm not dressed.
We may as well leave her, we're leaving the car and we gotta leave her some place anyway, what's the difference where?
There's something about a nice hot bath, transforms a person.  It's not just about opening up your pores, know what I mean?  There's just something about the heat and the wet that's calming you know?  Settles me in a way that I really can't articulate.
I know exactly what you mean.  It's just a feeling.  You know, I could go for some wine tonight.
Longer we hang around down here, Jack, better chance there is either Glenn's gonna fuck up the whole score, or we gonna get busted, or both.
You at least bring the gun?
I guess Adele's in good hands.
Let's go to Detroit.
Whatta you think?
I think Glenn opened his big mouth and now we got us another partner.
I think she's after Glenn.  The girl still with you?
Forget about my sister.  If Karen Sisco's tailing Glenn, we're fucked. Tomorrow night at the fights we all get picked up.
You know how I felt about her.
You know they gonna set us up.
You ever wear one of these?
You remember Buddy, don't you, Richard?
We made it, didn't we?
I'm going back inside.
No, you dump the van, meet me at the airport. I'll take one of Ripley's cars.
That's nice of you to offer, Karen, but I got all the help I can use right now.  Instead, let's talk about how you got the bump on your head.
There's a couple of points I keep wondering about have to do with the two guys that grabbed you.  Buddy is it?  And this fella Jack Foley.  I swear the man must've robbed two hundred banks in his time.
When I was seeing Carl Tillman, I didn't know he robbed banks.
And what happened to Carl?
Is that what you would've done?
Shut up.
Daniel.  Listen --
Where are you?  I been trying to reach you.
I'm at Adele Delisi's.
I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest.  Put the gun on the table.  I mean, now.
Daniel Burdon, please.  Karen Sisco.
Why you think is today?
Guy named Maurice Miller, also known as Snoopy, a former prizefighter.
Christ, I know Snoopy Miller.  He's a fuckin' wackjob thinks he's Sugar Ray Leonard.  Hangs out with a couple other Grade-A nutcases over on the West side.
Yeah, I got a problem.  This is the dumbest fucking shakedown in the history of dump shakedowns.  Three hundred bucks for a pillow?
Look, Snoop, I don't know what Glenn promised you or what you think you're gonna get, but the deal is me and Buddy get half of whatever we take from Ripley, understand?  How you and Glenn cut up the rest is up to you.
There isn't any.  All this shit you got in here.  What is all this stuff anyway?  Handcuffs, chains... what's this can?
Tell you the truth, I don't know.  I started when I was eighteen, driving for my Uncle Cully and his partner, Gus.  They go into a bank this one time in Slidell, Gus jumps the counter to get the tellers and breaks his leg. All three of us ended up in Angola.
I believe you would have.  Another fall, I did seven years at Lompoc.  And I don't mean the place next door where some of Nixon's people went.
Uh-huh.
Oh, you mean of Bonnie and Clyde?  Hm. You ever see pictures of him, the way he wore his hat?  You could tell he had that don't-give-a-shit air about him.
Yeah, I liked her in that movie about TV...
<i>Network</i>.  Yeah, she was good.
Peter Finch.
You're sure easy to talk to.  I wonder -- say we met under different circumstances and got to talking, say you were in a bar and I came up to you -- I wonder what would happen.
Another one Faye Dunaway was in I liked, <i>Three Days of the Condor</i>.
I'm just worried maybe I'm not old enough for you.
Think I could have them back?
Why not?
You like taking risks.
You kept touching me, feeling my thigh.
You know I saw you on the street.
You were going to see her?
What're you now, a desperado?  Put the guns down.
Who you talkin' to, Studs?  Me, or Buddy.  I can't tell, you got those shades on.
My point is, that's probably what you're gonna end up with.
You think he's lying?
Studs.  Man, I haven't heard that since Lompoc.  What's going on?
You're in civilization now, man, ease up.
I'd like you to go wait in the car. How's that?  Take her with you and put her in back.
Really?  Well, I uhhh...
You're the one with balls, Dick, say something like that to someone like Glenn.  Or maybe you just forgot where you were for a minute.
Have they got Midge up there?
The flight?
Ten, you count the prison hospital in Ohio I walked away from.
She did, huh.
Cheaper I guess, take us both down in one van.
I got a big score lined up up north. They wouldn't even know about it, it wasn't for me.  I could do it right now myself, except it's so fucking cold up there in January--
I remember you now.  Shit.
What's going on, Glenn?
He's supposed to be, but he hasn't shown up yet, which is a good thing for him.
You want to get out of here, run, it'll warm you up.
I wanna talk to you about a job.
Gimme another hint.
What-- when?
That was some shit, huh?
Why'd he have to do that to that girl?
No.  You gonna stay close to me from now on.  So you don't disappear on me.
I can tell.
Flyweight.
I'm looking for Maurice.
He said he stayed with Maurice.
Your dog was killed?
Was a she, name Tuffy.
Can't.  I gotta drive out to Glades, then I'm meeting Ray Nicolet at ten.
He's still married though, huh?
What'd I say?
I want to bust his ass, put him in shackles.
My married boyfriend - setting him up with that news story so you could talk about infidelity.  I couldn't believe it.
He waved to you?
A'ight, this time we gotta get the motherfuckin' trajectory right...  Okay, on three:  One... Two...
Excuse me.  Snoopy?  Did we settle the fish thing?
Are those <i>my</i> suits?
Midge.
What, good-lookin' sumbitch?
Are you sure they're here?
Are all the Yanks as anxious as you are to get yourself killed, Lieutenant?
Yes Sir.
Oh yeah.  I liked it so much I'm cutting you out of the squadron.
Hale-what?
Ever hear of mai-tai's?  Comes in a big...pot.  Like...like...
Shit, he's puking on my feet!
Earl!  You said the planes were ready but -- but what?
Good shooting, Rafe!
I don't mean how'd you do the paperwork, I mean how the hell did you do it without letting me in on it?
I have to talk to Evelyn.  And I want you to meet her.
I'm saying now you do know.  So it's time for you to fuck off.
Auxiliary field at Haleiwa, ten miles north of here.
They're all over us!
Maybe just trying to measure up.
It's shorter than our practice runway.
Colonel...we're all going.  Whether you make it or not.
What do you get for winning?
There's one thing I have to say.  I'm going away.
Rafe... No.  You forgive me.
It must of been a convincing letter.
We have a fighter screen up, in case we are attacked, Admiral.
The Chinese are sending out search parties to try to find the crews before the Jap patrols do, if any of the planes make it.
What's it going to be, Elizabeth? Seventyâ€”five? Eighty?
What's Peggy Sue going to do at your lodge meeting?
Grandpa, if you had a chance to do it all again, what would you do?
I hope so. At least I got to see you and Grandma.  Has it ever worked before?
How do you like my hair?
Why are you so nervous? What is the matter with you today?
We did for a long time. We just got married too young, and ended up blaming each other for missing out on things.
Oh, it's not so bad. I have two wonderful kids, my own business.  Still, knowing what I know now, if I had the chance to do it all over again, I'd sure do things a lot differently.
He is kind of cute, isn't he?
After Charlie told Walter that he broke up with you because he wanted to play the field, Walter decided he should do the same thing.
Peggy Sue!
I'm still waiting for the mortgage check.
I call this the staccato. 
I probably meant it when I said it.  Doesn't Lucky Chuckie want to come out?
Nothing.. Selling is selling.
Yeah, I know. Girls mature faster than guys. But last night, I was the one who put on the brakes. And you know why?
And why do you always refer to yourself in the third person, like Napoleon? How come it always turns into an argument with you?
What are you talking about? Who's Janet?
Does this mean you like me again?
Will you take me back to my grandparents?
Come back to me.
First of all, Richard is not a creep. He happens to be an exceptional person. If any of you gave him half a chance, you'd find that out.
Oh! You did that on purpose! I hate you. Go gargle with razor blades!
Take a long walk on a short pier.
If you believe it, darling, then I believe. Being young can be just as confusing as being old. The things that happened to me fifty years ago are more on my mind than what happened yesterday.
He's a fisherman! The most overrated writer of the century. I mean, he's the perfect American author â€ fat, violent, drunk...
Don't you get along with your parents?
The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club.
That was quite an evening. Bourgeois, phony, decadent, stupid.
Utah? I thought you'd be going to New York or Paris. What's in Utah?
Ssh. He's great.
Young lady, you're drunk!
It's not Charlie. It's me.
Peggy, let me ask you something.  You're not... expecting are you?
Jack, take it easy. She gave blood at school today. Maybe she's just a little lightâ€”headed.
Oh yeah. Charlie. How am I going to handle him?
Sort of.
What about?
Who was that man?
It was nobody. Ah... he's a poll, taker. I'm thinking of voting Democrat this year. But don't mention it to your father. How was school today?
Maddy's party.
I don't feel very festive.
I'm just happy to see you.
Don't eat the red ones.
I remember when you got that locket, too. You were so excited I think you showed it to the whole school.
What's up?
Don't be silly, I'm the best in the county.
The only time people like Dolores used to pay any attention to me was to laugh at me or insult me. That guy, Doug Snell, who shook my hand when we walked in, he used to call me a fourâ€”eyed worm.
You're a sweet man, Richard.
What a great kite.
You can till it with whatever you want. From illusions to memory, from experience to innocence, from happiness to the entire universes
Absolutely. People, dogs, elephants.
But when did you leave? Are you here until then? Were you there until now? What direction are you going in? Are you a moving point on an infinite line extending into the past? Can anyone do it?
That's why I was getting a divorce..  What I really think is that I had a heart attack at the reunion and died.
What are you doing?
Yep. It's going to be a law.  I broke up with Charlie last night.
It was an unfair fight. He didn't have a chance. I'm taking a real gamble. I loved him for a long, long time.
I couldn't help it â€”â I loved him.
Hey! Do you have any idea how much those beakers cost? I usually charge for hypnosis.
It's all, gone wrong, nothing's working out.
I came to say goodbye.
Goodbye? Where're you going? What about our partnership? I'm making real progress with the microchip.
...the pathologist... he said that you had reported a similar incident... with a cat...
I hear you moved into town.
That's Renee alright.
How long ago did this guy retire?
Geoff, this is crazy. Zowie didn't die.
He pissed me off.
Is this a good spot?
Why not?
Come on, that's just a bullshit story. You said so yourself...
What was that all about? You think he's trying to scare us?
Do you think everyone that came back would be like Gus?
How long have you been here?
Are we interrupting, Andy?
What's wrong with my face? You want to know what's wrong with my face? I've got a skin condition. Next question, Bob? No more questions? Fine. Now can you help me find the complaint?
You're right, I probably just misfiled...
Thanks, you guys.
It could be parasites, an infection...
You're going to the office?!
You're leaving the hospital? You're going into the office looking like that? Are you insane?
Drew!
Fuck you. This shit's probably not doing me any good anyway.
I'm not going to close the--
Maybe you should think about it.
Thanks, Charles.
Longstreet's interested in the Harrisburg deal.
... meanwhile, I'd like to prepare you for a colonoscopy, so we can take a look inside.
New baby?
Look. I know I have a case. If you don't want to take it for personal reasons...
Arline decision. Supreme Court.
What do you want?
There's a possibility I won't be around for the end of this trial.
Opera?
I'll look over the Q and A.
I love the law. I know the law. I excel at practicing it. It's the only thing I've ever wanted to do.
Do you take risks?
But you <u>were</u> having anonymous sex in porno theaters in 1984 and 1985?
That happened once. People weren't talking about AIDS then, the way we are now. Or safe sex.
You'd <u>heard</u> of AIDS in 1984, 85?
While you were employed at Wyant Wheeler, you did everything you could to make sure no one knew you were an active homosexual, correct?
Hi, Mom. How do you feel on your fortieth anniversary?
I said my earrings <u>are</u> American. They're African-American.
We object, Your Honor. It would unfairly influence the jury.
The HIV virus can only be transmitted through the exchange of bodily fluids, namely blood and semen.
It doesn't travel through the air, by breathing, or touching, right?
I might.
Would you like to have a drink with me? I just finished a game, I could use a beer.  I don't pick up people in drug stores every day.
You have a problem with gays, Joe.
How many do you know?
Your Aunt Teresa is gay? That beautiful, sensuous woman is a... <u>lesbian</u>?
Two men making love... ? Now tell me again... <u>why</u> is that disgusting?
I'll see you in an hour, max.
So during those long voyages, months at a time, out to sea, no women in sight, a hundred, hardworking, robust, young men, in the prime of their life, at the peak of their natural appetites, desires, their god- given, hormonal <u>instincts</u>... Anything going on?
Attorney for the plaintiff?
With all due respect, Your Honor... We don't live in this courtroom, do we?
This would be a good time to break for the day...
... to suit their personal desires, and the rest of us have to live with it.
Audrey? Oh, Audrey....
You mean...tonight? With all those things still out there?
As fast as you can.
I can't....I can't....
But they...they could still be....
There....
Like the light is scalding it.
Promise me. Swear to me you won't --
...I don't play that...I don't play that so just try again. C'mon, Riddick, tell me a better lie....
Let's just be sure.
You're not a real cop, are you? Just some mercenary who goes around talkin' about the law like --
This does not help us, Johns.
He's dead. Cap'n's dead. Christ, I was looking right at him when --
They're afraid of our light. That means we don't have to be so afraid of them.
And you're certain you can find the way back? Even in the dark?
So just like that. Wave your little wand and he's one of us now.
Well, just a skiff. Disposable, really.
Here's the deal. You work without the chains, without the bit -- without the shivs. You help us get off this rock....
Are you fuckin' kidding me?
Said "looks clear."
Ain't all of us gonna make it.
What's one more to you? Like <u>this</u> is the one that sends you to Hell?
Yes. I have to agree. From all you've found so far, his position's as good as yours.
That was different. We thought you were .... inferior.
Now, just a minute --
I don't. And I'm not going to try.
That was before Dr. Zaius and half the Academy said the idea was heresy.
No, thank you'. I won't get into that battle.
This place is dirty, doctor.
Ridiculous. That answer is a contradiction in terms. Tell us, Bright Eyes, why do men have no souls? What is the proof that a divine spark exists in the simian brain?
You could get hurt doing that, Doctor.
Did you see that? It's remarkable!
Huh?
What signal?
It's no use ... there she goes.
Because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for -- they're dust.
Prove it. If we can't get back, it's still just a theory.
There's only one reality left. We're here and it's now. You get ahold of that and hang on tight, or you might as well be dead.
Straighten me out on something. Why did you come along at all? You volunteered. Why?  I'll tell you. They nominated you for the Big One and you couldn't turn it down. Not without losing your All-American standing
Okay. You read me well enough. Why can't I read you?
I told you not to bring the other one.
One is in a museum!
Certainly not.	You're a mutant.
Because you're not unique. There was the one you call Landon --
Then there is another jungle?
Dr. Zira -- you state here that a ship from outer space sank in an inland sea of our eastern desert.
Let them talk, Mr President. Let them talk.
Hey Taylor, you don't know it but I saved your ass today. I killed a shit-eating dog. 
Say I can dig it. Smoke that shit everything kinda gets weird y'know?  Y'hear that story the gooks is putting chemicals in the grass so's we become 'pacifists' so's we don fight  Where the hell's everybody, they'se gettin high that's what - bunch of hopheads, they think they special...
Youse so fucked up man.
Come on you can do better than that!
You lame Taylor?
Yeah.
Shit, too bad we in base camp anyway.
You okay man? Neck botherin' you?
Yo getting there Taylor. You be cool now and I'll introduce you 'round to some of the 'heads'.
Three years, Jesus, he's crazy as Barnes...
You been smoking too much shit babe. Gotta control that. Takes a man down... I remember when you first come out to the bush, you was straight as a...
Hey that's great King, that's great... you take it on home for me, you tell 'em King... got your address right? You know where you can reach men, man. Anytime!
They don't know shit Barnes, and chances are we gonna run into something.
So what am I going to do! Get one of my guys zapped so some fuckface fresh from the World can get his beauty fucking sleep!
You know what I'm talking about!
Whatcha doing in the underworld Taylor?
I know Barnes six months and I'll tell ya something - that man is MEAN, red in his soul like a dick on a dog.
I didn't like it.
Squad? I didn't know we was still referring to this platoon in terms of squads sir. 
I have a darned good idea you're name isn't Betty Mayfield at all.
How about taking to Uncle Larry into the old firm? He's a useful guy to have on your side.
What's the matter, baby? Don't you like being kissed?
I'm afraid there's nothing more tonight, Miss. Unless you charter a plane.
It might be worth a Martini to you.
Whatever you say.
Much too late.
What's funny about that? If you pick up people like Larry Mitchell other people are bound to get funny ideas about you. The world is full of Larry Mitchells.
Let's not pretend Mitchell meant anything to either of us.
Certainly not to me.
That's the second round I've lost tonight.  That fellow hurt me.
So have I.
If you meant it, you wouldn't show it to me, Betty.  Or am I supposed to deliver it to dear Inspector Killaine?
There's a lot of water between Vancouver and the U.S.A. This note is a suicide note.  After you're gone where would they look for you?  Why would they look for you? Darkness, and open water, and a fast cabin cruiser.  And I have a pocket full of money.  And if I helped you, I'd be committing a crime, or so they tell me.
If they had any reason to.  Why make it tough for themselves?  Why go to all that trouble?  Here's an open book.  Close it.  No reason to keep it open.  She was a nice girl, anyway.  And perhaps she didn't kill him on purpose.  Perhaps she didn't kill the other one. You never know.  Give her the benefit of the doubt.  Leave her stay where she is.  Close the book. Finis.
This must have cost a fortune.
Killaine's wise.  We can't wait any longer.  Here, put this on.  But stay out of sight until we clear the harbor.  I'll tell you when. 
See anything?
I thought you had to be back to the hotel.  To leave my--my note.
I told you my father died in jail. He stole a fortune.  Most of it pretty dirty money.  I don't care to have that known.
In a way.
That man that was following us last night--he didn't come back this morning.  I'm beginning to wonder about him, too.  Was he really following me--or you?
You-killed-him?
I guess I'm a little screwy.  Maybe I could believe it.  Should I try?
Don't go soft on me, baby.  I've got your note in my pocket.  You wrote it, all by your own self. And I have to use it.  It has to be found in exactly the right place.
If it has to be--do you mind if I do it myself?  Oh, I don't mean with the gun. This is no trick.  When I wrote that note you have in your pocket-- that was no trick either.  It's not so hard for me as you think. I'm not crying about it, I've been skating close to it for quite some time.  The water is cold down there--  But so is everything else.  And there's you.
Yes, Miss.
Beer?  Well, all right.
I don't know her.. or particularly want to.
You probably know the type. You find them in hotels and resorts all over the world. They always have clothes, and money, and usually have had three or four husbands. They dress and enamel themselves with great care. They worry a great deal about those little lines at the corner of the eyes.. And they demonstrate their incompetence at the art of living bet getting mixed up with people like Larry Mitchell.  Tell me about yourself, Miss Mayfield.
I'm sorry, that's all there is.
Stop saying you're sorry. I want information, not regrets.
An unhappy marriage hardly seems a sufficient reason for that.
But not in the investigation of a major crime, I hope.
Is it a crime?
Nobody can help me. You, least of all.
This isn't a very good place to talk.
I might be able to save you.  If I knew enough.
What will they do to you?
I'm still asking. What do you want?
Name it.
You guessed it. The card's phony. I got plenty of 'em. Different names, different jobs. I work out of San Francisco. Go anywhere, do anything. All it takes is the folding.
That's a nice hard knee you've got, Goble. How'd you like to trade it for a broken neck?
I stick around and wait for the five hundred.
Until he comes. He's a nice guy. You've met him.
That's what I like about cocktail parties. Everyone is so perfectly natural.
Hardly. Who's the girl?
Near his right hand. About a foot away. Perhaps more. Good heavens, one doesn't use a tape measure.
How are you two getting along?
"Money is a sort of sixth sense that gives meaning to all the others." Very appealing, especially to a poor man.
And old man Clarendon?  He had a motive, too.  Margo and her money.
Mitchell was killed down here.  How could Clarendon get in to do it?  Or Margo for that matter.
Romeo in reverse.  Uh-uh.  No sale, Killaine.
No more for me, thanks.  Remember what I said.  I can't interfere with the law.
Lay off, can't you?
Want to walk out... or get thrown out?
Good afternoon, Mr. Campbell.
A little something on account perhaps?
So much less refined than frizzling them in the chair.
Passkey?
And now that he's safe from all other women, you can go on loving him.
You could have got in that room, just as you got in here. How do I know you didn't kill Larry?
I needn't keep you any longer, Mr. Clarendon.
I've met her.
Maybe we've been pretty dumb--
Was that about the right angle?
Well.  What about it?
I've handled it.  Mitchell's handed it.  If I wipe it off, no suicide. If I take it out and lose it, no suicide.  If I leave it here....no suicide.
So?
And she did give him the chance, the way it worked out.
I am a fool.
Not if it clears the air.
No doubt about that one.
Are you a policeman or a soft-headed nincompoop?
"Superintendent J. Mckechnie, Vancouver Police Department. Vancouver B.c. Replaying To Your E.P. teletype classification No. 2684 incomplete.  We advise identification possible.  Elizabeth Kinsolving, arrested Greenwater, North Carolina, January 8, 1948, on a charge of murder.  Signed, FBI., Washington, D.C. H. Cleary, Inspector in charge."  Have ye any comment, Killaine?
But you still think she's innocent.
What are my orders, sir?
It's against the law to cross the border with a gun. The Canadian police might like to know about this.
Right.
You're very attractive, my dear. And you look very unsophisticated.
She'll be here next weekend.  Why don't you come too, James?  I'll                       * show you the marshes properly.  If you're lucky you might even see the first of the geese arriving from Siberia.
Well, I'd hate to be a nuisance.
Freshman and sophomores...
You know the lingo.  Jolly good. So your language will have to be simple, not stupid, mind, but simple, very, very simple, and always remember it's an American readership.
I quite liked it.  I wasn't as enthusiastic as everyone else.
I thought it was tremendous.
You don't like flashbacks because your mother's a historian.
Did she talk about me?
Might?
He's making plans for Brighton. He thought we could travel down together.
BlasÃ© and epicene.
I'm off.  Let's meet.  You promised to tell me about Norfolk.
Still in love?
What about the Cromwells?
Wait...and with talks at the United Nations still making little progress, tension and anxiety settled on MPs of all parties in Westminster.  Speaking on the Jimmy Young Show earlier today, Mrs Thatcher said the prospects of a peaceful solution did not look encouraging.  What is it?
Not bad.
Hello, Jimmy.
And Joe Ramage - do you remember him?  He comes and helps out in the shop.
The bed's all made up if you want to stay.
Ploughman's Lunch.  Traditional English fare.
Darling Susan.
Something happened.  You got nuked in the last quarter.
What's their program?
Thanks for stepping in.
The only way to win out here is to surrender.  You have to feel what the wave is doing, accept its energy, get in sync.  Just feel it all moving in the blackness... you don't need to see.
I did.  What's the matter?  Don't trust me?
Where's Roach?
Wild ride, huh?
Sir?
All the food groups?  Avoiding sugar?  Caffeine?  I see to it that my people maintain cardiovascular fitness.  We stay off hard liquor, cigarettes...
Babes.
That's the point, isn't it?
Harp, let me tell you something.  I was an agent in this bureau when your mommy was still wiping your shinny pink ass, and you know one thing I learned in all those years that you still haven't?
Forget about it, kid.  They're ghosts.  Let the goddamn yuppie Mormon affirmative action assholes handle it.  See I'm almost 55... so I must be senile, right?  They better get me out before I start pissing myself in public.  Drooling. It would look bad for the Bureau, right?
... Four months.  June to October. Mmmm...same the year before.
Big zippo so far.  How about you?
... Felony B and E, three months in juvey.  Better.  Felony assault. Postgraduate work at Chino. Excellent.  I'm lovin' it.  What about the brother?  Great!  Another model citizen. These guys really fit the profile.
Did he rob it?
They took a left at the next light!
What is it?  You all of a sudden got this bug you had to go surfing? This is a line, right?
I came out here from Ohio a month ago.  Never saw the ocean before.  I didn't think it would effect me so much.  Like I'm drawn to it, or something.  I want to do what you do.  It's the truth.
Bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies. I hope you're not buying into this banzai-bullshit like the rest of Bodhi's moonies.
Jesus Christ, Johnny -- you've been using me!  Your jacket's on the floor in the bathroom -- this goddamn thing's half out of the pocket... Oh God, it's all part of some case, isn't it?
Tyler, put the gun down.
Hey!  Uh, how do I get back in?
She's too valuable. She's got to know their whole network. The whole set up. We take her with us.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
No way, Dutch. I'm going. You get these people and get the hell out of here.
Put him in his poncho and liner and carry him back. We'll bury him in the morning.
We've got most of the flares, frags. and two claymores just outside. Nothin's comin' close to here without trippin' on somethin'.
I'm sorry, Bull. It's never easy. He was a good soldier.
You lift off in three hours.  There's one other thing.
There's something else, Major...
What's he got?
I dunno.  Do thigh high, leather boots go with a cocktail dress?
We're on the verge of closing a large navy contract.  Double is ridiculous but we can assure you a healthy profit on your shares.  We would give you a promissory note...
I like your hat.
No.
I don't question the legality of what you do.  It's your morality that makes me sick.  I will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you.
What?  You gonna tell me you're lost?
No, you look like a hooker.
What's your name?
If you're making fun of me, I don't like it.
What's your name, lover.
Vivian --
I fucked the debate team in high school.  Tsk.  I had a grampa. He liked ties on Sundays.  You mind if I take a swim in your bathtub before I hit it?
Of course.  How much?
It's very tasteful.  I think you'll especially like the zipper in the crotch.  I'm -- joking.
Whether I liked him or not is irrelevant.  It's business. There's no emotion involved in business... if you want to survive.
Why not?
What about dinner?
Clean the slut up, take her out, huh?!  What are you trying to prove!?  I'm not a piece of meat for you to offer to your friends!
Well, it's true.  Just pay me what you owe me and I'm gone.
Huh?
But don't they have it in English?
If you'd gone on about how much you liked it, I'm not sure I'd have believed you.
Yes.  The man made a business decision.
You're packing.
I didn't think so.
Barnard Thomas, manager of the hotel.
I want to.
Edward, did you hear me?
Someone's loaning it to him. Get on it right away.
Excuse me for saying this but what is wrong with you this week? First, you go soft on the pension funds.  Now, you're giving him the chance to get away?  As of two minutes ago, you are committed to the tune of over fifty million dollars --
Why do you want to know?
This is no time to disappear. We're in too far.
Bill?  Stop panicking.  Kross isn't going anywhere and I don't need to spend the rest of the day watching his stock go down.  I'll be in the office tomorrow.
Did I wake you?
And I don't like what we've become.  I'll cover any losses you have on this one.  Now get out, you asshole!
I kissed him, Kit.  On the mouth.
It was great.
He wants to set me up in a place, give me some money.
All I'm doing is feeling lousy about it.  I don't know what to do.  What do I do, Kit?
I leave extras, miss.
I'm just going to my room.
I got a dress.
I rather hoped you'd be wearing it.
Hmmm... I vonder vich. 
I like steak.
Yes.  Something... conservative.
I don't think it would fit you.
Do you remember me?
Yeah.  Sure.  Why not.  Call me at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.
Get out!
If we surrender, and I return with you, will you promise not to hurt this man?
He is a sailor on the pirate ship "Revenge." Promise to return him to his ship.
Every ship but the four you sent.
Yes, I am a silly girl, for not having seen sooner that you were nothing but a coward with a heart full of fear.
And what is that worth, the promise of a woman? You're very funny, Highness.
Does it bother you to hear?
And what am I?
But what if something happens to you?
Who's Guilder?
I thought I was going faster.
You don't look so good.  You don't smell so good either.
Tilt his head back. Open his mouth.
Where did we put that wheelbarrow the Albino had?
What is it?
-- well, when does it get good?
What?
Because I can stop now if you want.
See? Didn't I tell you she'd never marry that rotten Humperdinck?
Westley's only faking, right?
You want me to read this or not?
Many of the thieves will resist. My regular enforcers will be inadequate.
Form a Brute Squad then. I want the Thieves' Forest emptied before I wed.
No.  To the pain.
Who won? How did it end?
The loser ran off alone.  The winner followed those footprints toward Guilder!
I could never cause you grief; consider our wedding off.  You returned this Westley to his ship?
Who are you? -- Are we enemies? Why am I on this wall? -- Where's Buttercup? --
What? What?
Thank you for everything.
I was eleven years old. When I was strong enough, I dedicated my life to the study of fencing. So the next time we meet, I will not fail. I will go up to the sixfingered man and say, "Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to kill you.
Get used to disappointment.
You know what a hurry we're in.
What, Humperdinck? Humperdinck. Humperdinck. Ooo-ooo, Humperdinck
Yeah, an hour.
Who are you?  What do you want? Why are you loitering in my hallway? Speak, dummy, speak!  Why don't you speak?
You have exactly ten seconds to change that disgusting look of pity into one of enormous respect.  One ... Two ...
Do the books!  Do the books!
Look at that.  A white Rolls Royce. That's it baby, when you got it, flaunt it.
Where?  What?
But that's cheating!
Help!
Assume away!
You've done it yourself, only you did it on a very small scale.
So what?  What did it get me?  I'm wearing a cardboard belt.
See?  You could have raised a million dollars, put on a sixty thousand dollar flop and kept the rest.
Aha, aha, aha, aha, aha, aha!!  So, in order for the scheme to work, we'd have to find a sure fire flop.
You're going to jump on me.
Don't touch me!  Don't touch me!
What kind now, Leo?
But if something should... God forbid... go wrong, at least we could give them some of their money back.  It would look better in court.
Bloom, Bloom, maybe it's not true.
No way out.  No way out.  What?  Who?
I vas never a member of the Nazi party.  I am not responsible.  I only followed orders.  Who are you?
Mr. Liebkind, relax, relax, we're not from the government.  We came here to talk to you about your play.
My play?  You mean, "Springtime For ... " you know who?
We loved it.  We thought it was a masterpiece.  That's why we're here. We want to produce it on Broadway.
No kidding?
Really, I never dreamed ...
Franz, don't you see, Hitler was a man of his time.  This is a man of his time.
Franz, trust me.  I promise I won't let you down.
You mean you had the slow fuse in your pocket all the time and you forgot to put it on?
Vhy do you always call me kraut? Kraut is cabbage!  Do ve call you hot dogs?  Ve call you Yanks not franks!
Feeling better?
Thursday.  Thursday.  We'll play Thursday.  We'll play the Contessa and the chauffeur.
Oh, the best one.
I can't take my eyes off you.  How can I drive when you drive me mad. Mad.
Oooh.  I love it.  Hold me, touch me.
Like clockwork.
Oh, it's fine.  Fine.  Good.  Good. Bye.  Bye.
Of Siegfried...
Heil you know who!
Oh joy of joys!  Oh, dream of dreams!  I can't believe it.  Birds, birds, do you hear?  Otto, Bertz, Heintz, Hans, Wolfgang, do you hear?  Ve are going to clear the Fuhrer's name.  Fly, fly, spread the words.
No good, baby, no good.  You heard my orders.  Nobody retreats. Attack!  Attack!
Who can we attack?  They're all too big.
Where's Goebbels?  Where's my little Joe?
We won.
Oh. I thought... you said you'd been to so many in two days...  What was it you wanted to ask?
We have reason to believe she came this way... might have stopped in this area...  Did she stop here?
How early?
Of which morning?
You said she was sitting "back there," or standing rather...
And when she left, she never came back.
I do mind. If it don't jell, it ain't aspic!  This ain't jelling.
Someone is sitting in that window.
I'm not a fool! And I'm not capable of being fooled! Not even by women!
You came up here on a hunch, Miss Crane? Nothing more? No phone call... from him, or from your sister herself?
Well... heck, this is the first time I ever saw the customer high-pressure the salesman!  I'd figure roughly...  ...your car plus five hundred.
Yes, Mr. Lowery.
You better run out to the house. She may be... unable to answer the phone...
Here?
What's the matter?
I was getting to that!
What do you know about it?
No. The man whose money she... he talked so loud and fast, and I... I should've called the police.
No.
She haven't even called you?
Sam. He said an hour. Or less.
It's been three.
Are we just going to go on sitting here?
Whenever I start contemplating the panic button, your back straightens up and your eyes get that God-looks- out-for-everybody look and... I feel better.
Yes.
That wouldn't be a wise thing to do.
Stay here.
Where could he have gone?
Well?
I wonder so many things about her now.  Why she never told me about you...  Funny, when you think there's an answer to everything, you think you know all the answers.
Hospital clean.
Bates never denied Mary was here.
What do I do with my free afternoon, walk you to the airport?
I'm fed up with sweating for people who aren't there. I sweat to pay off my father's debts... and he's in his grave... I sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony, and she's living on the other side of the world somewhere.
I thought I'd gotten off the main...
The bathroom.
You're not going to go out again and drive up to that diner, are you?
You're very... kind.
What are you running away from?
To a private island, like you?
No, not like me.
Of course not! Am I acting as if... something's wrong?
I'm sorry.
Why?
We have a problem.
We thought, if you didn't mind, we'd go out to the motel with you.
Why don't you call Norman and let him say just what happened, if he give the man a hot lead and he did just scooted off... it'll make the girl feel better, Albert.
Recluse. Kinder word.
Barefaced.
I'll take you to...
Yes.
My mother is not dead!
...Forty thousand dollars!
Was that all?
Yeah, between the gangsters and the autos, we won't need another war to carry off the population.
You mean he doesn't work for you?
So--friendly or otherwise--?
What' s the idea [of wanting so many] do you sell them [to the doctor]?
Oh, I see. Cats' fur.
Oh, just the basement. Some day I intend to build an experimental laboratory down there. It will save me from intrusion.
You here again?
Dr. Meirschultz, please.
That spoke to you?
The child!
You killed him!  Come on with the rest of it. You killed him!
I don't have any affairs. What do you mean?
Ouch! Eat? You can do a solo if you don't step on it. I'm going to bow out on you.
I think so.
No -- I -- wanted to speak to Ralph. We had a silly argument last night and I said something unkind.
Oh, you children, you happy children. You've quarreled and now you're going to be friends again. And that is as it should be. Never let any stupid misunderstandings come between you.
But it was really my fault.
Well, ain't that a shame. Nice little chappie that wouldn't harm a fly ... everybody picking on the little fellow.
No, there's another point I want to iron out.
Now don't that call for an extra!
About the Gale girl, I mean. Where do we go from there? What of it?
What do you mean?
Almost certain.
Go on, little girl, take your troubles somewhere else. I don't feel like talking to you.
You used to go to Worth's place a whole lot. What makes you sure it wasn't there?
No kiddin'.
Do you know George Winton?
Don't they? He's down at The Tombs right now.
He's not a stag hound. His name is Kelly and he's a police dog.
Gee, that's great. After the bad opening that night the old boy was pretty blue. This will pep him up. Have you told him about it?
My lawyers will be on the job in a little while, and I warn you people anything you print about me you've got to prove. Dad won't stand for--
Hmmm. Why didn't you tell that to the police?
No.  Why didn't I take her out somewhere? But she was laughing and seemed so happy.
You go in for dangerous things.
My partner believes that I should build a horror chamber, immortalizing the hideous crimes and criminals of London. At such times Marie Antoinette has reassured me, she has promised me recognition for the devotion I gave to her.
Is that a fact?
That doesn't seem so bad to me. What is wrong with it?
That is unfortunate. They will have to wait.
I'd know him anywhere.
What was her name?
Why am I doing this?
Well, I got to see her.
They were just bad men, that's all.
Actually, I am, though.
Well, are you satisfied now? Can we just lie and talk, huh?
I'm curious to see what it's like. I'm very curious, Rose.
Yeah, but satisfaction brought him back. Can I?
Well, you're sweet, but you don't really love me.
Rose, are you all right? Are you sick or something?
Don't worry, Rose, I won't tell a soul.
You're going to get yourself up and go out?
Did your Momma really give you castor oil?
Rose, you must know who the fellow is.
Oh, he's so kind, so gentle inside, and so unhappy with that rich wife who doesn't understand him, her being a Southerner and everything, and what a bedside manner he has got -- so gentle and kind beneath the professor way he acts!
You don't know the bedside manner that man has got. Why, it does me good just to see him sit there all solemn and go pokin' in his bag like he's gonna cure me, which he did of course. And even more important he loves me, like a patient I mean, the other day he got tears in his eyes just listenin' to my heart beat.
Of course not!
I never saw anything like it. How did she pick him up so fast?
Yeah, he's still up there.
Daddy says Rose is calm as lettuce. Do you believe that, Doll?
It's pitiful. Neither one of them know.
I think she's gonna kiss him.
They're discussing it.
He kissed her.
Chattanooga. I had St. Louis, Missouri.
It isn't that she hasn't got any sense, Doll. Her basic intelligence is probably above average, maybe quite a bit above average.
Not for long, boy. I've outstayed my welcome already.
All right, Daddy. We have our drink, we're out on the patio, you have prepared me for it. Rose's cancer has come back, hasn't it?
Nobody lives forever, boy. Who'd want to?
Go ahead, Doctor, I think I am following you.
Please do.
Slow, hon. But at least I can concentrate now that Rose is here.
Well, I'll admit I don't see any flies on her yet.
Be nice to Rose. She's never had a real home.
What's the matter, hon? Is anything wrong?
Who doesn't have such thoughts?  We'd better get going.
Forgive my crudity, darlin'. All I'm saying is that a girl who would wear clothes like that is going to get in trouble sooner or later.
Honey, Dr. Martinson isn't a rascal, he's one of the finest physicians in Glenville. He studied at Johns Hopkins University.
I don't care where the polecat studied.
She can't get a job, it's a depression. And we can't just throw her out on the street.
Honey, Rose was born on a farm and has terrible memories of farm life. Now I don't think --
I don't give a hoot in hell's hollow what it means to her! She can't stay in this house forever! I fired her, damn it!
Is anything wrong?
Why, sure, always got time to get you a half-a-cup, and one of these days I'm gonna get you a whole cup and see what happens.
Is this ill right?
Strange voices, Rose?
Good morning, Rose. And how do you feel today?
Wonderful. Except I can touch the place back there with my tongue, I wouldn't even know I had that tooth pulled.
Boy, for four or five days there I didn't think I'd live. But I'm my old self again!
Mr. Hillyer, I know it was bad and I hadn't ought to of done it. But I'm only a human girl and I... I ain't always perfect. I promise I won't let him in the house no more, I promise. Won't you and Mrs. Hillyer forgive me?
Tennessee?
I'm not cryin' because of me, I'm cryin' because of somebody else.
Well, I... I... ah-h, let's see...
Well, actually, we have a little black boy named Her---t who lives in the garage. He does it for me.
Well, her people were very poor. She says she was often hungry as a child, and I'm sure the food she ate was pretty awful, not a balanced diet at all.
We make our own lives, Madam. As for malignancy, I don't think so, it's very unlikely. I probably shouldn't have even mentioned that possibility to her.
Are you going to get your degree soon?
Well, I think it's charming, Rose.  But don't you think... ah, the skirt is a little tight?
Never again, never again...
You look very pretty in it, Rose. Really, you do.
You're not gonna see him again.
Incestuous.
If I tell you, how do I know you won't just club me and take it back?
Filthy kids go to kindergarten too. What are you saying, anyhow?
I can work this.
Make a hole, Billy-Boy.
Yeah, but if we don't sit, they'll take our badges.
Remember those two uniform cops who been giving us such a hard time... ?
The booze.
Why do I always have to sit in back?
It's just the way things are, kiddo.
You been wearing rubbers, Billy-Boy?
No, we're stealing.
You live like a pig.
Our resignations.
And, what... what am I forgetting? Oh, yes... the transvestite junkie whose bullet riddled body came blasting through the front doors of the precinct house!
Don't you condescend to tell me how or why to honor Independence Day, and don't tell me I'm overreacting when I'm trying to bust the guy responsible for half the filthy junk coming into this city!
What can we do for you, officers? What new, mindless harassments have you planned this morning?
Pardon me... my mistake.  Taking your thoughts in hand, huh... ?
Hold your horses, sweetpea.  We need Butch Cassidy alive, remember?
Alright, flesh-peddler, let's see empty hands!
Dead.
Hey-Ho... !  Maybe we're not alone in this thing after all.
You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.
I can't kill my own father.
It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders.
Leia!
I'm sorry.
Proper?!
We're coming!
Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right?
Your father?
I know. Somehow...I've always known.
I will not fight you.
Yoda, I must know.
I see.  So this wasn't simply a chance meeting.  You came here with a purpose.
He was a Science Teacher at Denton High.
Janet.
Yes.
What was that bang?
We must have a blow-out.
Oh....Say something.
Brad...
Maybe we could try it this way.
Great scott - Scotty - Dr Everett Scott.
You did right.
Ssssh.  Brad's probably asleep by now. Do you want him to see you like this?
What guy
Oh no no no no.
What's funny?
Some people are very shy by nature.
No, I don't belong here.
...I've never been in a man's apartment before.
I should leave.
-- The legs.
Rocky, do you realize everybody in this country knows your face, and after the fight everybody in the world is going to.
Oh, Rocky -- you worked so hard.
Einstein flunked out of school... twice.
...Paulie. Stop now!
I want 'im outta here --  Don't think I'm good enough to work for Gazzo?  That's what I think of bums like you an' Gazzo!  You're goin' up an' don't care enough to throw Paulie some crumbs!  I give ya meat, an' I give ya my sister, too!
You busted?!
Too old, dull fighter.  Bobby Judge is a good boy.
...That boy damn near broke my arm.
I'll carry him 'till the third.
My side.
No doctor!
One more round.
Rocky Balboa -- His record's poor --
He was big, an' very nasty so I destroyed him in a hurry -- Now I'm gettin' ready for Mac Lee Green next month.
The Bicentennial Heavyweight Championship of the World is gonna be held in the only place it can be held -- Philadelphia! -- the nation's cradle -- January First -- the first major event of our two hundredth year.
Me an' my wife are goin' home 'cause we miss our children an' can't go no more time without seein' them.
I don't like ya face.
Don't like yours neither.
Kiss my ass.
Hey, the rink is empty 'cause we're closed -- ya ain't allowed in here so do me a favor an' not stay here.
That's it, I'm broke.
I know the juice is climbin' -- I been workin' six months just to pay the damn interest.
No, two yards from Snyder, an' a grand from Cappoli.
Buddy's in a bad mood -- prostate problems.
Buddy's got a thing against ya, Rock. Some people just hate for no reason, y'know.
Ya gettin 150 grand killer. Ya got any plans for it? Whatta ya think? Ya like to put it on the street, make it work for ya?
Rocky, do you have any representation? A manager?
Absolutely -- Sparrin' with the Champ would be an honor -- y'know what?
...Screw you.
I like 'em. If you don't you can f --
'Cause that's the way guys are -- They laugh when ya talk dirty. They think ya cute for a while, but then ya getta reputation an' watch out. Nobody's ever gonna take ya serious. Ya get no respect... I gotta use a bad word -- Whore. You'll end up maybe becomin' a whore.
Ya hope I don't keep acting like a whore or I'll turn into one, right?
Goodnight, Rocky.
...What?
I was talkin' with ya man, Mike. -- Hey, how come I been put outta my locker?
Twenty-five, thirty -- What's the difference? -- It took me two months to learn the combination of that locker.
...No.
Ya puttin' me on?
I done it all. I've done an' seen everything'. Believe what I'm tellin' ya -- Ya shoulda seen the night in Brooklyn, I smacked 'Ginny' Russo outta the ring, September 14, 1923 -- same night Firpo knocked Dempsey outta the ring. But who got the Press? He did. He had a manager -- September 14, 1923.
Please, kid.
See how fast he is -- damn!
Ya nose is broke.
Damn! How's it look?
How you holdin' up, kid?
I don't care what they say, you're a winner.
...What kinda dog is this again?
Forget her. You could do better than my sister.
Every mornin', every night I pass by -- I smile. I say jokes. Nothin'. She looks at me.
My sister's a friggin' loser.
I'm thirty myself.
An' you're dyin' alone, too.
I'll do okay.
Hey, who cared about me yesterday, huh? Nobody -- I think I'm gonna train myself.
How ya feelin'?
Yo, what's with you? -- It was suppose to be private.
Outta my house I want ya!!
I'll tear his head off.
Yeah, I had to go slummin'.  See, a friend of mine's bein' framed.
My problem is I come here to drink in peace.  So if you don't mind...
So where is it then?
That's Marvin Acme, the gag king.
Yeah, Eddie, it's not like you got an ad in the Yellow Pages.
Maybe they just took it out of his pocket.
Eddie, you still got it.  Hey, tomorrow maybe I'll go down to probate court and see who's sniffin' around Acme's estate?
Are you gonna call him, Eddie?
A freeway, Mr. Valiant, is eight lanes of asphalt running uninterrupted from L.A. to Pasadena.  Pasadena to Hollywood.  Hollywood to Santa Monica. Someday everyone will be in cars driving happily, non-stop from one end of the L.A. Basin to another.
Earl... it's me, Valiant.
Yeah, I'll bet you would.  You gotta have the rabbit to make the scam work.
Where is he?
When I opened up the blue envelope, all that was inside was a blank piece of paper.
He was blowin' his lines, all right. So what?
How much do you know about show business, Valiant?
Here's the problem...  "Seen cooing over calamari with notsonew Sugar Daddy was Jessica Rabbit... wife of Maroon star, Roger".  His wife's a tramp, but he thinks she's Betty Crocker.  The doubt's eatin' him up.
The job's gonna cost you a hundred bucks.
When will I hear from you?
Does this help?
Me.
Yeah, a Toon.  It was the guy who killed Bambi's mother.
I'll get it.
You know, Eddie, I'm not as much of a chump, and a patsy, a yokel as you think.
Yeah?
Boo! Ah, ha ha. Ooh. Boo! Ha ha ha.
Then I defy you, stars! JULIET! JULIET! I will hence tonight.
Your looks are pale and wild and do import some misadventure.
Where the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home to-night?
Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
Is the day so young?
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
By giving liberty unto thine eyes; Examine other beauties. Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
Forbear this outrage, good Mercutio.
Uncle, this is that villain Romeo, a Montague, our foe.
'Tis he.
Such mortal drugs I have, but Verona's law is death to any that utters them.
Young son, it argues a distemper'd head so soon to bid good marrow to thy bed: or if not so so, then here I hit it right, our Romeo hath not seen his bed tonight.
That's my good son: but where hast thou been
Madam, in happy time what day is that?
O sweet my mother cast me not away. Delay this marriage for a month, a week. Or if you do not make the bridal bed in that dim  monument where Tybalt lies.
Geth thee to be and rest, for thou has need.
I uh, by and by I come--But if thou mean'st not well, I do beseech thee--
But all this did I know before. What says he of our marriage? what of that?
Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?
Ahhh!
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
I doubt it not. Trust me, love, all these woes shall serve for sweet discourses in our times to come. Adieu.
A man, young lady! Lady, such a man As all the world- -why, he's a man of wax.
Nay, bigger; women grow by men.
Young hearts run free. Never be caught up, caught up like Rosaline and thee. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
Not I, Not I believe me: you have dancing shoes With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
Is love a tender thing? It is too rough, Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
That dreamers often lie.
That's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams.
I will follow you.
A Plague o' both your houses.
OH, and but one word with one of us? Couple it with something. Make it a word and a...a blow.
Do you really think so?
Coordinate all you want, but make sure whatever you do gets cleared through me.  Are we in sync on this, Vincent?
You go shoot me if you want, Vincent, but you'll be dead before I hit the ground.
So what's the deal?
When we're done with this, I want to do for that one myself.
Plastic fucking surgeon?  You think I'm going to fix this, Deirdre lass?  It's the mark of the patriot, and I'll wear it like a badge.  As for those who done it to me, I'll take my pound of flesh before this is all over.
You were a soldier, were you?
I feel as if I've wandered onto the set of Enter The Dragon.  Could you teach me to do that?
Part of me says I should just look at this as a perk.  You know, a bonus.  But then I remember you're you -- Deirdre who used to belong to the IRA -- and it occurs to me that deceit and subterfuge come very naturally to you.
And when I consider that, I have to wonder if you don't have some ulterior motive for being here, with me, right now.
Where do you get off saying word one? All the time pretending to be one of us, it's the same thing we were doing, Seamus and myself.  And here you are so high and mighty, like you're so different from the rest of us.
I didn't say I was.
I use my cell phone to get computer access to the telecommunications satellite used by our target.  I trace his cell phone signature and use it to pin point his location as he moves through Nice, relaying that information to you.
I'm touched, really, that they'd send someone of your caliber.  It's nice to know that they didn't make the mistake of underestimating me twice.
Here's yours.
Edvard said the same thing about you before he died.
Don't talk to me unless you tell me what I want to hear, understand?!?  You have no choice in this, don't think about winning, think about staying alive.  I want the item, and if you don't give it to me, I'm gonna kill you.
It was a mistake, it shouldn't have happened.
How so?
There is one other thing...
Yes, Sam's tough alright.
Some, thanks.  Enough to move on, for now.
Perhaps forged is a better word.  Like steel.  Like a sword.  You're a modern Samurai.  I've spent my life around extraordinary men -- men like Vincent. But I've never seen anyone like you.  I'm afraid Vincent will die if he goes with you.
Not for long.
I'm just worried about your health, Larry.  You could stand to shed a few pounds.
After we stop the target car I get out and use the heavy artillery to kill the driver and his bodyguard.
You should learn a little patience.
It's consider a virtue in some corners of the world.
I didn't know that you spoke French.
What'd you say to him?
Not at all.  Similar, but not the same.
I've wondered that myself.  None of this answers my question, though...  Why bring me?
But how did you know I would have the presence of mind to pull my weapon when I did?
I haven't.  Not like that.  How do you get used to it?
Not exactly.
You're with Interpol -- you're a cop.
We?  There is no we in my world now, Vincent, just me.
The address of the Russian production company.  Just in case we need to find them.
Do what?
Business keeps you on the road?
No you don't, and you know it.
Do we need anything else?
Why not?
That's a good question.
Let's get him out of here...
What happened to it?
It's the Irish tape we want.
What I've heard so far, it's all a lot of talk.  I wasn't so sure what to make of it at first, cause, like I said, the Irish and the Russians are an unlikely mix.
I gotta try and overcharge him, he has to moan about the price, we settle somewhere in the middle.
Whatsamatter with you?  Aren't you concerned about all of this?
Cash and Carry, you know, FDR, World War two...
Well someone's gonna find them.
Why?
We would never have to worry about money -- ever again, Jesus!
Suppose someone knows about the money?  They're bound to ask questions.
It's going to go bigger than that. Could you stare someone straight in the face and lie about it?
I'll worry about that when it happens and if it happens, and it's not gonna happen!
That's right!
I don't want to hear about miracles and God and all that!  We tried to murder someone to cover our asses!
Well, we didn't know that at the time.
It's the right thing to do.
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!
Shit!  We're gonna have to get rid of him.  I'm not letting some gangbanger ruin my life.  We can't risk it.
He's probably made copies.  He's not going to give them up to us.
How long is it going to take?!
You don't know if he was really gonna --
Oh Jesus...
What are you talking about?
It's NOT too late!
Why don't you get to the point.
All right, Jesse, we'll play it your way, under one condition.
Ok...I'll wait.  For now. But I'm going to need a little advance, to oil the wheels, so to speak.
I understand your logic, Booth, but I don't think...two thousand's going to raise any eyebrows, do you?
Two thousand...
None of us like it!
I was beginning to think you weren't going to show.  That can't be all of it.
Whoa, Earl!
Well, not that I wouldn't sugar bun but Earl's in a bind.  They're going to take his car.
Has he?
OK.
And I'd end up a widow in two ways.  Let's forget it.  I'll just be a little more careful next time.
He started digging through my closet, something he never does.
I'm going to quit.  That's what has to happen first.  Then we're going to tell him.
I don't know, Booth.
Things just got a little screwed up, that's all.
Yeah.
I have a better plan.  You want to hear it?
That's news to me.  So it's over at Jesse's office?
Sheriff Hogan --
Some of it.  Denning only handled a small portion of the total, but it looks like this was one of his bills.
What the hell is that, some kind of porno store or something?
Lingerie...
I have an anniversary coming up, thought I'd buy her something special.
I don't suppose you've seen her.
C?
I'm just not very good...with all of this stuff.
Damn itâ€™s hot in here...
I'm at a payphone in Vegas.  What's up?
I'll do my best...that doesn't give me much time.
No.  Something wrong with you Dwayne?
Hey where's the hot pad?
Don't you want to hear about my day?
Well you're not getting, either.
I don't suppose you'll tell us where the tape is.
Easy to purchase, hard to detect. Too much potassium can kill a man.  Just have to...pick a discreet spot.
At least around here it does.
Anything in it?
Is it true, Carter?  Are you in Hong Kong right now?
I got my sources.
What?
The S.S. Minow Johnson.  Funny, the name on the back was "Red Dragon."
You see, no bomb.  Now stay away before I throw you both in jail for obstruction.
Blend in?  I'm two feet taller than everyone here.  Where you going?
Carter, get off that stage!
I knew you were lying.
Man, are you crazy?  You think that scares me?  I'm from  L.A.  We invented gangs.  We were having gang wars before anybody even thought about it.  We get royalties from other gangs.  Now gimme your badge and gun and I'll show you how it's done.
No.  You are a civilian.  In China, I am Michael Jackson, and you are Toto.
I'm sorry.
I'm a dangerous man.  You're not gonna ruin my massage because of some midget in a house coat.
It's my job!
You.
What, leave you alone so he can cap you?
Why the hell should you believe him?  He had us beat up.  Naked.  That's nasty shit.
You thought the "Customs Agents get blown up" and "smuggling" and "Ricky Tan" and you put it all together and came up with a five year old case. That's why you didn't tell me what we were doing...
Maybe.  But not like Asians.  We never panic.
It's your turn!
There's people up here!
Let me see it again?
Well we're not friends.
See you in the next world.
I think we should stop talking.
You thinking about that girl that dumped you?
No mu-shu.
They'll probably torture us first, shock our privates, then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the head.
That looks exactly like my Uncle Darrell.
Lee, what the hell are you doing?
No, Carter.  I can't take this.
This money is evidence.
I could use a little vacation.
I don't know if the Fu-Cang-Long paid you to get rid of Tan, or whether it was a pure vendetta killing -- but you're off this case.  I don't ever want to see you again, you got that?
Just trying to make it look real.
How do I know I can trust you?
I'm asking for real now -- will you help the Secret Service?
The Praying Mantis school, in Bejing?
Nobody can protect me.  I'll make a deal with you, Lee.  But only iff you'll get me out of Hong Kong.
You don't move, you understand?!  You don't move!
He stole my wheel!
We are both full of shit.
I am afraid I don't understand the importance of this information.
What?
It was a man I was after in Hong Kong.
That's not how it goes.
No, no.  It's not good-God you all! It's Good-God, ya'll.  Ya'll!
No, fish is a PM food.
This is my territory now.  You are my responsibility.
No, wait.  I don't have it.  You have it.
Oh no, I dropped it.
Yeah...beautiful. What would you call that paper there? Kind of a...Robin egg blue color?
They put you in charge?
In Charge.  Just me'n him.  No interference.  They don't even want to hear from us until we're done.  I love the F.B.I.  I love the F.B.I.
Well...listen, if you need any help, you know, back up, call me, OK?
Yeah, if you're Superfly.
Sir, he's just gonna get in my way. If I'm gonna handle this situation...
Hey, hey, you start touching me there, I'm gonna start movin'! Word up, mother...
She's fine.
Hello.
Han?
I do.
Yes sir, me too. The State Department has authorized release of the funds. We'll have to make the first drop at 7.  As soon as they pick up the money, we've got Å’em.
Bob -- are you making friends with this man?
Yes, yes, I'm sure I only did you good, Maggie.
Only respectful things.  What did we have in common back then... What kind of music did you like... Did you ruin my life when you left me standing at the altar...
God... Of course.  I'm sorry -- I mean, I'm...  Brian -- I've got to go.  The man's a lunatic, but I know exactly where he's going next.
"Make the shot."
Fully.  I like her.  She has wit.
No, that's what makes you unemployed.
Well -- I'm sorry, I'm really sorry, Ellie.
"Paid vindication"  That's what I call justice.
No, I'm paying for the dress.  Do you think she's still gonna run?
You're coming here?
Of course we are.  Of course.
Get this man a Kamikaze.
I don't know.  I'm working on it.  I was on the wrong track.
Unbelievable, she got to you.
Sorry, no.  I just got one.
And you are?
Looking for Maggie.
This game is pretty important to him. He made all-stars in high school, you know.
Well, wedding cake freezes.  This we know.
That's fair.
I take it the desk clerk is one of your many admirers.
My magazine doesn't pay because for stories.  It's not what you call ethical.
Oh, but making up the facts as you go along is ethical?  Actually, I meant you.  You probably got severance or expenses or both.  I'll take your check. No credit cards.
Too much.
I don't know, give me a minute.  Are you all right with this?
That's right.  You're so lost you don't even know how you like your eggs.
I'd rather not.
About a minute...?
Okay.  So... what, uh... What just happened?  Just now?  Jus then?  In there?
I think so... When I was walking down the aisle?  I was  walking toward somebody who didn't have any idea who I really was.  And it was only half the other person's fault, because I had done everything to convince him that I was exactly what he wanted.  So it was good that I didn't go through with it because it would have been a lie, but you -- you knew the real me.
Thank you.  Do you think I flirt with Cory?
No.  I'm weird.  Weird and mysterious are two different things.
But I'm weird.
Grandma!
I'm just finishing up, too.
Just stop it.  Don't say another word like that.
There's no why, Annie.  I'm just not up for it.  I never said I was.
Tell me he's living in squalor. Tell me everything he has is being repossessed, including his filthy, dented mobile home.
He's got a houseboat.
Nope.
That doesn't make any sense.
When you get back, I'll be gone --
Beautiful view, isn't it?
Actually, he sounded nice.
They knew it.  Time, distance, nothing could separate them. Because they knew.  It was right.  It was real.  It was...
It sounds like the name of a mattress store --
You are.  You're losing your mind.  What about Walter?
What?
Is this crazy?
You were standing in the middle of the street?
You don't know who she was, Annie --
So I mailed your letter.
We're going to the Rainbow Room and the symphony tomorrow night.
No, I know that part --
Howard.
Thank you, Tom.  I feel so much better just having blown this off.
I notice these things are back in fashion.  Oh, honey.  He's a lovely man, Annie.
Magic.  It was magic.
Mom!
Of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department, so don't be worried if it takes a while --
Sure you do.
Magic.
I'm not selling anything.  Your son called and asked for advice on how to find you a new wife.
Who is this?
Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of Network America.
I'm not mad at you.  Okay, I'm not mad at you.
Have you had any relationship since?
I don't think I could really describe it.
It's not that late in Seattle.
Where's your mom?
I'm sure he won't be angry once he realizes how concerned you are about him.
Okay, but if I get yelled at, I'm never gonna listen to this show again.
It is easier to be killed by a terrorist --
Hey, my plate is full.
Seventy... eight.
This is the best movie I've ever seen in my life.
I have forty-two.  So that would definitely cover taxicabs, I think.
Dad?  About last night?
Does red pepper go under R or P?
I forgot to mention.  Jed called --
Oklahoma.  Do you know where that is?
It doesn't.  They ask you.
If you get a new wife, I guess you'll have sex with her, huh?
I miss her.  What do you think happens to someone after they die?
The heels on these shoes are very large.  Why have I never noticed this? The heels on these shoes are grotesque.
It's a sign.
It's a short word.
Was Mom an adjustment?
Fine.  I won't say anything. You can marry Count Dracula.
What's wrong with Annie?
Shut up?  Shut up???  Mom never did that.  Mom never said shut up to me.  Mom never yelled at me.
Hi.
Eventually, in a few months, you'll start seeing women, you'll meet someone.
You did?
He's ten.
Absolutely.  When I come back, maybe the two of us should spend some time together, on our own.  What do you think?
I told you it would happen. It's bound to happen when a man works alone!
Naturally. You think I parked here for a cup of coffee?
You're welcome to one.
I've tried everything but shootin' 'em down.
You want 'em all arrested?
It's the paymaster from Moscow -- with our gold.
Hear you had a little trouble, Quintero. Defective fuse?  Well, you're all in one piece. So what's the beef?
I checked the drift just before he blasted. It was all clear ... The man must have been asleep or something.
He can't drink this milk. It'll make him sick. He's on a formula.  I was a fool! I shouldn't have kept him with me.
So they had a little taste of what its like to be a woman ... and they run away.
Forgive me ... for saying you never thought of me.
They say I am no good to you.
Over my dead body.
I don't want your dead body. I don't want you back in jail either.
But it's yours. I won't let them ...
She's the organizer's, wife. She's got to be there.
You weren't waiting for me.
Alone?
Aah! They've got other mines. You don't see the larger picture.  They've got millions. Millions. They can outlast us, and they know it.
Aw, cut it out, Ruth.
Go on. Spill it.
No. New York.
Where's your mama?
But Papa -- you need all the help you can get.
But you've got me doing everything. Mama never used to make me dry the ...
RamÃ³n ... listen for the love of God ...
My kids don't have enough to eat!
You think my kids have enough to eat, you rat?
Are you Australian?
Yeah, but he was in silhouette.
Did you see his hair color?
Who wouldn't?
Why? The guys is ready to deal now.
I guess I don't have a hell of a lot of choice.
Then leave.
You don't understand.
Turns out I'm allergic to steel-toed boots. Go figure.  By the way, I'm not looking for a matching set.  Where's Quincey?
Just a fucked-up guy who played beautiful music.
: What are you up to?
What do you want from me, Colette?
I don't want anything. Why are you so suspicious?
It gets me through the day.
You've got a comeback for everything, don't you, Danny? You use 'em like some sort of shield.
It's not that easy. I just got a raise. I need the money.
Who is it?
You've got to deal with this sooner or later, Tom. You can't keep hiding.
I know a guy.
Nice day
Why's that?
Business.  I need to leave town and I find myself in dire need of some cash.
What?
Fuuuuuck
Jimmy, where do you find these people?
What the hell is that?
That was my idea.
Not bad.
But I just met you.
Come on, guys ...
CAN I PULL MY FUCKING DICK OUT?!
This is bullshit.  You didn't say anything about anybody else being here.
God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker.
I was getting to it.
When?
This chink have a name?
Bullshit. He's a liar.
I'm afraid so, Danny.
Yeah.  What about him?
We know what's going on.
What'd you do, piss your pants?
Nervous?
And you've got wiener breath.
Why didn't you just ask for directions back there?
First you want me to ask for directions, then you don't.  Which is it?
But that's okay, Liz, you're the one with the steady job, you pay all the bills. I'm just an unemployed musician.  You have every right.
We're in business.
Report.
Resistance?
He's the last of four brothers, the other three were killed in action. This is straight from the Chief of Staff.
You writin' a book or somethin'?
Fuck Private James Ryan, fuck him, just fuck the goddamned son-of-a- bitch.
So, that's Ryan.
Yes, sir.
Captain, my feet are most uncomfortable.  If I'd 'a known we was gonna have to walk all the way to Ramelle, I never would 'a volunteered for this here mission.
In the shadow by those two trees.
Watching.
Sorry, sir, fresh out of trucks, how 'bout a '38 Ford Roadster, hard-top, red with black interior.
I wasn't made for this.
Upham, you've got to learn the difference between whining and griping.  You can't just rely on natural ability, you've got to study and practice.
But, sir...
Worked, didn't it?
What about Talbot?
You ever going to open those letters? Miller keeps his eyes on the maps.
You think they'll be alright?
They're fine.  As long as they can gripe, they'll be alright.
HOLD YOUR FIRE!
Yeah, Vecchio, I couldn't remember his name, he was a good kid, remember how he used to walk on his hands and sing that song about the man on flying trapeze?
She's the best poker player you ever saw.  My father used to go to these Saturday night games and lose his shirt.  Finally, my mother gave him an ultimatum, either she gets a regular seat at the table or she locks him in every Saturday night. He squawked and so did his buddies but after a while they gave in and from the first night she sat down, she never lost.  She could read those cocky bastards like they were playing open hands.  And he bluffs?  He had sixteen levels of bullshit.  Her eyes, the tone of her voice, her bets, her jokes, the way she sipped her coffee, she was a master.  She won more money on shit hands than anyone in the history of the game. Every Saturday night, my father would lose two, three hundred bucks and she'd win it all back and then some. And I'd stand there, glued to her shoulder, from the time I was five years old, watching every hand, every move, studying how she did it.  That's why I'm such a good officer, I can look at a man's face and tell you exactly what he's holding, and if it's a shit hand, I know just what cards to deal him.
And what about your own hand?
Oh, yeah?
And how do you bluff yourself?
That's the rub.  I liked Wade.  Who's Ryan?  If they're both standing in front of me and I have to shoot one or the other, how do I choose?  Look at my hand, there it goes again.
What do you think?
No, I'm not, Kaback is, honest.  Or what about Faulkner?  Or that little guy with the glasses?
Captain, I gotta tell you, the irony of this mission is fucking killing me.
I should be on my way to Caen, sir. It's like Beethoven, the guy's one of the greatest composers ever lived and he goes deaf.  Go figure, I mean, who'd he piss off?  And here I am, the Beethoven of ladies foundation garments, one step away from Caen, the center of the known lingerie universe and instead, I'm going to Ramelle to save some fucking private who's probably already dead.
Well, maybe not the Captain, but the rest of us have mothers.
I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA.  HERE WE COME.  Cover me.
What deal?
Sir, if the Krauts are holding this bridge when division shows up, our guys are going to be sitting ducks.
Yes, Private.
So, where are you from?
But everybody's heard of him, he won the Congressional Medal of Honor, he saved a dozen men.
On guard, glancing back.  Pissed off.
We believe that your father operates in a large pool of cash that comes from phoney billings, phoney patients.  We've been investigating him for five years.  We believe that when they die, he takes their money.
What's the profile?
Jesus.  What, I live in a palace, right?  I have guests here.
The, uh, Cynthia Branson estate was worth how much?  Because her family...
Why can't you be his uncle and not his playmate?
I was hilarious once, wasn't I?
No, no, don't go in there.
Alright, alright, alright, calm down, alright, calm down. Nothing's different.
Lloyd, send her flowers, write her a letter.  Something.
The world is full of guys.  Be a man.  Don't be a guy.
Lloyd, it's us.
That was a mistake.  The rain on my car is a baptism.  The new me.  Iceman, power Lloyd.  My assault on the world begins now. Believe in myself, answer to no one... You probably got it all figured out, Corey.  If you start out depressed, everything's kind of a pleasant surprise.
I just had a phone call.
No, no, just listen.  You won the Wreath  fellowship.
Lloyd was such a gentleman.  He was funny and nervous and strange, and I met people that I never would have met before, then I blew it.  I called him basic.  Can you believe I did that?
You've always called before, always.  Now I'm not asking what you did, I just want to know that you're alright.
I'm fine.
Dad, maybe I shouldn't go with all that's happening to you.
It doesn't feel right to me.  I, I don't even have the right luggage yet.
'I like him'?  Diane, I'm talking about being honest with people, being decent...
Sweetheart, no.  Don't be ridiculous.
Swear to god, I need to know the truth.
Alright, alright.  Go ahead.  When I'm old, give me someone like me, but go ahead.
No, I will.  I don't want to leave something out because I know I can say anything to you.  You're a liar, and a thief.
Yeah?
Quick question - do you know who I am?
Are you busy on Friday?
Well, not monumentally.
Hmmm....
Well...
Pardon me?
What are these?
That's cool then.
It's just you and your dad, right?
You know what?
What?
Job?  Being a great date.
Me?  Sure I do.
Yeah.  With potential.
I don't know.  I'm happy.
Check your mail tomorrow.  I sent you a letter, a letter.
Your letter came yesterday.
No, we don't have to say it.
Yeah.
Okay, how much time do you need?  I mean, you know, I mean you'll be leaving in a little while, so that's answered some questions. 
Yeah you do.
You shared it with a dick.
No I didn't.
No.
Just my dad.
I'm sorry.
I love you.
Okay.
Why don't I just get your phone number, that's usually how it works.
Yeah Lloyd.  What are your plans for the future?
No, really.
"You can't know the horrible disappointment I feel..."
Joe.  Joe.  She's written sixty-five songs.  They're all about you.  They're all about pain.
How ya doin' Miss Evans?
Lloyd, everybody in that party put something down on their record except you.
Yeah.
I called her up.
I'm Lloyd Dobler.
You know Diane Court?
Maybe we'll come by tomorrow, help you clear up or something.
Later for you, Luke.
There are some things that are unclear. We need to talk.
You know, they told me you were going to be trouble - Czurda and Scherner.
Do you have any idea what's involved? The paperwork alone?  Forget you got to build it all, getting the fucking permits, that's enough to drive you crazy.  Then the engineers show up.  They stand around and they argue about drainage - I'm telling you, you'll want to shoot somebody, I've been through it, I know.
Where are the guards?
So I'm responsible for the weather?
This is not my problem.
That's great.
I'm having a drink, come on in, we'll have a drink.
What others?
Once the war ends, forget it, but for now it's great, you could make a fortune. Don't you think?
Yes.
You try to be fair to people, they walk out the door;  I've never understood that.  What's next?
You think I don't know what you're doing? You're so quiet all the time?  I know.
And killing.
Four hundred, four fifty -
There's a rumor you've been going around miscalibrating the machines.  I don't think that's a good idea.
File a grievance with the Economic Office, it's your right.
He's stealing from you, Oskar.
The killer was trying to get to her. That sorority girl was a distraction.
Yes.
That's okay.
"Drink with your brain." That's our motto. Who are you calling for?
I did that.
Did it?
It helped me realize one thing.
Now, Gale, you were so instrumental in my freedom. You're not having character doubts now, are you?
Already did. He's the perfect suspect, don't you think?
Parents are always responsible. It all starts in the home.
But youâ€™ll never get away with it.
Lemme take you home.
My screwed up life shouldn't have to bleed onto my friends.
Why?
He seemed harmless.
I read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly. Hook, line...
A verdict and premiere all on the same day. I love it.
Weâ€™re hoping for the death penalty. I have this whole DEAD MAN WALKING swan song exit planned.
And we didnâ€™t want to do that, Sid. We wanted to give you your moneyâ€™s worth.
We have a surprise guest star waiting in the wings.
We had to have financing.
Miss Weathers.
Oh Dewey, I'm sorry.
Meaning?
What are we looking for?
Can we turn the light on?
This is all too familiar.
Dewey, there's no such place.
No, wait...
What?
I donâ€™t know.
It's okay. Look, Hallie, I'll meet you outside.
You're not allowed to ask that.
It's all about sisterhood. Everybody thinks its about partying and blowjobs but...
..we only promote safe rubbered sex.
SHOWGIRLS. Absolutely frightening. What's yours? Wait, let me guess. THE HOUSE ON SORORITY ROW? FINAL EXAM. GRADUATION DAY? THE DORM THAT DRIPPED BLOOD? SPLATTER UNIVERSITY? Am I close?
You ass.
Sid? Jesus, where's Hallie? I've been here all night.
Listen to me. We've got to get help. The Killer's here.
Thanks for the movie, Randy.
Wait, wait. Don't hang up.
I swear to God if you lay a finger on her I'll fucking kill you!
It's CICI! Cici's the name of the character she plays in the movie!
So is that why you're here? Is that why you're holding me from my show, to tell me about some brutal homicide I'm not even involved in?
I go to the police station and do my job, and you go back to being Gale Weathers.
Can't arrest ghosts.  But the best way to stop being haunted is to be with people.  You're here, you're not hiding, you've done the right thing, Miss Prescott.
Because, that means that we're dealing with an ordinary, flesh and blood killer.  And I know how to handle guys like that.
Detective Kincaid?
What Rielly?
Nice to finally meet you, Sidney.
I can see nothing's changed.
Dewey my God I thought you were dead.
Dewey, personal lives and pasts aside, this is about Sidney. We need to know where she is.
Uh-huh. Another News clipping. Another one about Sid's mom. Dewey, whether we like it  or not it looks like we're going to have to  go back into our past.
Why would the police come to you?
It was fucking '60 Minutes II'!  I couldn't say no!  I could've been the next Diane Sawyer!
Dewey, you're not just here because of that second rate K-Mart, straight-to-video version of me, are you?
I already removed it.  I think someone on the film was trying to find Sid, and that's the only reason I came here. To make do a little private investigating of my own and make sure no one here was planning anything.
I've got my suspicions but still, nothing  you say can ever make me take my eyes off one person.
Jennifer needs me.
I happen to work for the police god dammit!
Gale, your engine's still running.
Thank you.
Do you want us to come with you?
What's your point?
It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Roman.
You! How can I ever get any fame playing you!
God damn you Gale Weathers! Don't you see? The killer is choosing  his victims as they die in the script! Ben Damon's character was the first one to get offed. So was his girlfriend - but she wasn't cast yet so his real girlfriend was killed - then Sarah Darling's Candy, and now me!
Being Gale Weathers.  What the hell are you doing?
You know in the movies, I play you as being much smarter.
Oh my God Karen you scared the shit out of me! What are you doing here?
Wait a second Sid. Don't you go jumping the gun. You haven't seen the best part.  With the aides of the computer revolution of y2kI've been able to steal your voice.  Ain't it cool? Listen to what the police are gonna find next to your lifeless, mutilated body.
What character?  I'm Candy, the chick who gets killed second.  I'm only in two scenes!
This is Candy.  Hang on, let me get some clothes. See!  I don't' understand why I have to start the scene in the shower!  The whole shower things been done, 'Vertigo' hello!  And I mean, my boyfriend just died, why am I showering?
Roman that's not the line.
Let them try. You'll never find me. I've already gotten away with murder before. For instance, Maureen Prescott.
Who is this?
Yes.
She'd have been so happy, Sidney, to know we'd be together.
Alright I'm here, now show your  face so we can finish this.
Laura I think I just killed somebody.
Uh-huh I'm sure. I've killed someone! OH MY GOD I'VE ACTUALLY KILLED SOMEONE!
Duh... that's quick.
Dude. What are you doing here?
Think about it. On the off chance I get caught -- a motive like that could divide a jury for years, don't you think?. You took my mother, so I took yours. Big sympathy factor. Maternal abandonment causes serious deviant behavior. It certainly fucked you up. It made you have sex with a psychopath.
It's on the table.
Yes, sir.
I'm sorry. Don't hate me.
I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house.
Understand what? That I got a girlfriend who would rather accuse me of being a psychopathic killer than touch me.
It's been a year since she died.
So...
I'm gonna rip you up bitch. Just like your slut whore mother.
Yes.
Hello.
I only eat popcorn at the movies.
Do you like scary movies?
I'm two seconds from calling the police.
I swear it. And he's big and plays football and will beat the shit out of you.
Please don't hurt him.
But you're doing so well.
Productive. So they're closing down the school?
Really? You small town guys are good. And have you located Sidney's father?
Evening, ma'am.
Keeping an eye on things. Checking the place out.
Ma'am, I am the Deputy of this town.
I like it. It's... sexy.
Nah... it's just this town's way of not taking me serious.
God, look at this place, it's THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN.
I see you as a young Meg Ryan myself.
It's Deputy Riley today, Sid.
How is she?
He'd have to be crazy. Where's Sidney?
She's with my sister. Should I bring her in?
Hold off for now. Just stay close to her.
She'll be with her friends over at Stu Maker's tonight.
Jesus...
Casey? Where are you honey? Call the police, goddamnit.
When did that ever stop you? You can't sit on this. This is huge.
If I'm gonna blow this up -- I need hard proof.
The control board's glitched. You know we can't carry a live picture.
Off the record. No cameras.
Many times.
Do you like scary movies, Sidney?
So where are you?
I heard screaming.
You're absolutely right. I'm the first to admit it. If this were a scary movie, I'd be the prime suspect.
What's Leatherface doing here?
There are certain rules that one must abide by in order to successfully survive a horror movie. For instance: 1. You can never have sex. The minute you get a little nookie -- you're as good as gone. Sex always equals death. 2. Never drink or do drugs. The sin factor. It's an extension of number one. And 3. Never, ever, ever, under any circumstances, say "I'll be right back."
You heard Billy -- shut the fuck up.
Oh God! You don't know? Casey Becker and Steve Forrest were killed last night.
Thanks, Tatum.
Do you really think Billy did it?
Take a message.
If they were having an affair how come that Cotton couldn't prove it in court?
And you believe it?
How does that get you in the mood with Stu?
Is this not cool or what? Hey, Sid, what happened?
What about the trace on his bank account and the guns?  There must be something to connect him with a past.
How you feeling?
Thank you.  Tell them, thank you.
I guess... decide for yourself.  I don't know what it says.  I'm going to go.
What?  What?
Put it down.  Put it on the ground.
What do you mean?
Delusions of grandeur.
You're going to be remembered, and it's all because of me.  And, the only reason I'm here right now is because I wanted to be.
And, I remember breaking your nose.  You're only alive because I didn't kill you.
All this effort you've made to get transferred, it's the first question that pops into my head.
I wasn't standing around guarding the local Taco Bell.  I've worked homicide for five and a half years.
I'm declining this case.  I want us reassigned.
It's too soon for him.
I read.  Remember reading?
I'm certain.  He was the biggest defense lawyer around.  Infamous, actually.
Right.  But there, pride comes first, not gluttony.  The sins are in a different order.
What?
All we do is pick up the pieces.  We take all the evidence, and all the pictures and samples.  We write everything down and note what time things happened...
I'm, sorry, but even the most promising clues usually lead only to other clues. I've seen so many corpses rolled away... unrevenged.
I've seen the same.  I'm not the country hick you seem to think I am.
He doesn't have the desire somehow.  Our killer seems to have more purpose.  More purpose than Victor could ever conceive of.
I think Hemingway wrote somewhere... I can't remember where, but he wrote that in order to live in a place like this, you have to have the ability to kill.  I think he meant you truly must be able to do it, not just faking it, too survive.
How do those cockroaches get here so quick?
They pay cops for the inside scoop, and they pay well.
This quote... his first words to us.  I looked it up.  It's from Milton's Paradise Lost.  "Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to light... "
What are you talking about?
No dates indicated, placed on the shelves in no discernible order.  It's just his mind poured out on paper.  I don't think it's going to give us any specifics.
You tell me, then... you walk into an apartment, and a man has beaten his wife to death, or the wife murdered the husband, and you have to wash the blood off their children.  You put the killer in jail.  Who won?
Where's the victory?
What is it?
You have a strange way about you... I mean interesting.  I'm sorry.  It's really none of my business.  It's just nice to meet a man who talks like that.  If David saw that paper, he'd say you're a fag.  That's how he is.
You have to put blinders on sometimes. Most times.
Well, I got up one morning and went to work... just like any other day, except it was my first since hearing about the baby. And, I... I felt this fear and anxiety washing over me.  I looked around, and I thought, how can we raise a child surrounded by all this?  How can a child grow up here?  So, that night, I told her I didn't want us to have it, and over the next few weeks, I convinced her it was wrong.  I mean... I wore her down, slowly.
Did the wife confess?
Crime of passion.
Yes.  Look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here.
How's California?
But Mose Harper said...
This 'un come a long way 'fore he died.
No sir...pleasure.
You can forget that...  Wouldn't be legal anyway.
He cometh forth like a...
Now son, it's a bitter thing to say, but there's more than your sister at stake here.
If there's anything I can do, sir...
Hold on, son...Who's this Colonel Greenhill you're talking about?
JOINT action?
My name's Edwards...I'm looking for my niece...she was in that camp when you attacked...
Say it. We're beat!
And you think we got a chance to find her?
Jorgensen's been runnin' his cattle with my own...
Sorta like 'roundabout' -- like a man says he's goin' one place when he means to go just the reverse...
Oh...
Futterman?
Let's go...I think I stumbled onto somethin'...
What I heard back there was that a band o' hostile Nawyeckas came through this way less'n two weeks ago...
You got yourself a <U>wife</U>, sonny!
Why didn't he make his move back there?
Not no more.
Well, we only got the one lead -- Scar...And where we begin to look, I don't know...
I'd be obliged if you'd get to the point, ma'am.
You ever see it before...like mebbe on a dress Debbie wore?
Oh, all right! Well...Martin says...
From the beginning...
I'm a woman, Martie...  We wash and mend your dirty clothes all our lives...When you're little we even wash <U>you</U>....How a man can ever make out to get bashful in front of a woman I'll never know...
Don't cry, Laurie...I understand how it is...I'll just go 'way...
I have to cut his windpipe...
Ellen, move aside...
They say it's fantastic.  At least that's what I read in a men's magazine.  So who are the two lucky ones?
I mean the armchair!
You?
Is everything alright?  Aren't you feeling well?
"Events commonly interpreted as haunting apparitions often result from psychic disharmonies or undigested traumatic ordeals..."
This house, the whole damned area around here is one mass grave... Now you might call me crazy, but there is something negative about the place.
It's important - he knows the last chapter.
I guess it's too lonely for most folks.  It's time for me to get going. It's been a pleasure meeting you.
Do yourself a favor:  Don't ask.
I've killed my husband!
You are a gentleman.
Oh, Thomas! She has cut my strings! I am unmanned, unmended, and unmade, like a puppet in a box.
Romeo. Wit, swordsman, lover.
I have a wonderful new play!
But I have to pay the actors and the authors.
Of course not!
But nothing is happening.
She is always Aphrodite.
Mr. Henslowe, will you lend me fifty pounds?
By God, I wish I knew.
How will it?
I have a new one nearly done, and better. The Massacre at Paris.
"But new struck nine."
Be good to her, my lord!
But Silvia I did not care for much. His fingers were red from fighting and he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons. Stage love will never be true love while the law of the land has our heroines played by pipsqueak boys in petticoats! Oh, when can we see another?
Lord Wessex, as I foretold, has lost his wife in the play- house--go make your farewell and send her out. It's time to settle accounts.  How much was the wager?
"I know not."
I have lost my gift.
Are you to be my muse, ROSALINE?
I am, Master Shakespeare.
Oh my lady, my love!
I must. Look-- how pale the window.
Oh--no, no!
I found something in my sleep. The Friar who married them will take up their destinies.
Lord Wessex. You have been waiting.
Do you intend to marry, my lord?
Good morning, my lord!
Take off your hat.
She loves me, Thomas!
Does she say so?
Constantly. Without doubt. And plays the lute, she has a natural ear. And her bosom--did I mention her bosom?
I think the lady is wise to keep your love at a distance. For what lady could live up to it close to, when her eyes and lips and voice may be no more beautiful than mine? Besides, can a lady born to wealth and noble marriage love happily with a Bankside poet and player?
"Poet?"
You are on my ground.
All right, just a few questions.
I'm only asking you both to think about it.
Do I? What? What? What are you talking about?
Is this necessary?
What? Yes, that's fine.
You're not eating.
You looking for me?
It doesn't neccessarily matter. They don't even know who those people are, and even if they did, they have nothing to connect them with us, nothing at all.
They can know all they like, it won't do them the slightest bit of good --
Sex lines? Is that it? Triple X-rated interactive fantasy? Old habits die hard.
I bought the tickets. One for her and one for me. It was my idea.
Cover it?
This is just an informal discussion.
Well, Cameron, are you comfortable?
Yes, thanks.
For the flat.
Aroused and inflamed.
In a moment he's going to tell he could have been someone --
A miserable, burnt-out, empty shell of a -- Alex pauses, looks at his drink, then at Juliet.
No.
David, I promise we will. Keep him happy.
Who was it?
Will you calm down.
Exactly. Now I've been thinking --
We could put it somewhere.
No.
Aren't you going to answer it?
No, definitely not. And that's that. I refuse to discuss it further.
What?
I see.
Who said there were four?
Loks like you had a break-in up here as well.
Yes.
Are you all right?
Two hundred.
What do we do here, David?
Here.
There's a whole wide world out there, and it all needs to be accounted for, doesn't it?
Yeah, here, I mean, where else?
A priest who dies.
Yes, I mean, who wants to read about another dead priest? It's about some other guy, some guy who's not a priest, who doesn't die. You see, it's better already.
A little bit. Is that good or bad?
Shall I answer it?
No. I haven't seen them.
Diseases.
She's a very groovy girl. That's the problem.
Maybe... why do you ask?
What're you looking for?
She's got a...
I don't know.
I'll be back in a while.
I don't want to talk about it...
I've never been treated that way, and I'm not going to start now.
What're you doing later?
No, I know.
Comb my hair out later, honey.
Why didn't you come alone? Lester invited you. Did you have to bring her?
That headboard.
You're rude. I mean, you're very rude.
No, baby. Now look, that girl that called -- I have to talk to her, she'll do something.
No.
I guess so.
Okay.
Chopped liver?
C'mon, are you or aren't you?
In fact, I don't think I've ever been to a beauty parlor in my whole life.
I am not!
Right.
Right, that's right.
Yes, Buffums.
What!
Look, Norman, I'm not the shampoo girl.
-- Listen, I'm supposed to take Jill to El Cholo tonight. She's really going to be pissed if I don't.
-- Maybe she'll come with us. If I tell her how important it is to me, I don't think she'll mind. Do you?
You don't seem very sure.
Great.
Bernstein... seemed to think I hated men.
Can I count on that? I just want to see Lester with me and that cunt in the same room tonight.
Now, baby... if I told you about her... then you couldn't count on me not telling anymore... could you?
George...
-- you'll be the prettiest thing in the room -- light's green...
No, I blew it, I blew it with Lester.
I've got to leave?
What's too late about it? Look, we're not dead, are we? That's the only thing that's too late.
I can't just let him stand by the door...
Do you know what that Lillian Bercovici just did?
If I have to touch her again, I'll throw up!
-- oh -- sweetheart...
-- you shouldn't do me like that...
I have to see you.
Let me come, too.  Please don't leave me alone.
I've had these dumb dreams lately.
I just... who what?
I don't know. I can't remember. It was just in my dream.
How are you, baby?
Great, great, fantastic. Fantastic. Incredible. Incredible, really incredible.
How?
George.
Oh, great, listen, baby, I gotta get back, okay?
Honey, have they offered you the job?
No, but I think they might.
Your advice!
I want your feelings about it.
I know, honey.
Television or movies?
Didn't you, baby?
I just want to know, that's all.
Baby, don't do this --
-- please, baby --
What? What? What? What? What?
Did you?
George, if you keep this up I'm going to scream.
You need a cut.
They're not?
I wish my son knew what he wanted to do.
Well anyway...
Yeah.  How long have you been here?
What do they look like?...
I wanna know your thinking, I wanna know how someone like you thinks. Did you think you could get away with it, did you think you could put something over on me? Does a guy like you get his kicks sneaking around behind people's backs and taking advantage of them? Maybe that's your idea of being anti Establishment!
Oh, are you kidding, man? She hates her.
No thanks.
Oh, by the way, I think you oughta know -- Lorna thinks she's got the clap.
What?

What do you mean?
Okay.
Well, commercials. I read for a soap the other day.
A soap?
I was too old.
What was it, somebody's daughter?
Yes.
Oh, hi, I mean hello, we've met.
I called to tell you I was sending one over but the line was busy, you're always on the phone.
So I can't talk to some broken down actor, what do you think, I'm going to tell him I'm screwing Lester Karpf!
It's very logical, it's the most logical thing in the world. You wouldn't feel this confined if we could go out with people and have dinner, and a little conversation and so forth...
Aren't you going to have one?
Lester, this is my friend Jill and this is Johnny Pope.
Who are they?
Does she know about us?
Fine.
I think you're crazy. Don't look over, it's Lenny Silverman.
So what's your point?
We don't think marriage is important.
How much?
-- I was in the kitchen doing the dishes and George was out in Long Beach doing a show...
-- uhh-huhh...
... my friend doesn't like it here either.
-- no.
I don't think so.
-- there's not much room --
Gee... that's wonderful, Jill.
Please don't misunderstand... I'd really like to go.
How's it going, Doc?
Dad?
No, Dad.
I'm not supposed to.
Maybe he showed me something.
Room 237?
Yeah.
Sure, Danny, it will be lots of fun.
Oh what a Maze.  Isn't it beautiful.
I didn't think it was going to be this big, did you?
Mommy... Mommy...!
No.
Where does he go?
Advocaat is it?
Grady?
Ah ha, it's coming off now, sir.
I'd be glad to do that, sir.  Oh why don't you call me back in about eh twenty minutes?
Thank you very much.  I'll do that.
Don't let it get you down Mrs. Torrance - it's big but it still ain't nothing but a kitchen... a lot of the stuff you'll never have to touch.
Pleased to meet you.
What'll it be?
and it will then take me time to get back to where I was, understand?
Yes.
I had... I had the most terrible nightmare I ever had.  It's the most horrible dream I ever had.
And you didn't see anything at all?
I...
Why?
Wendy give me the bat.
Give me the bat.
Physically, it's not a very demanding job.  The only thing that can get a bit trying up here during the winter is eh... the tremendous sense of isolation.
can of itself be a problem.
The police eh... they thought that it was what the old-timers used to call cabin-fever, a kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur when people are
Good.  Glad you made it before they shut down the kitchen.  Is your family having a look around?
Oh...well this is our gold ballroom.
The moon's not down yet...
I don't want your money. You're a booger.
Don't tell me what I have to do and what I don't, booger-brains.
Please, Uncle Al.
You booger.
Rattling. Rustling.
Mom-!
I'll give you the telephone numbers of my ex-wives, dear boy- they'll be interested to hear that.
She and dad are out back lighting the barbecue. Jane's walking around like she's King Shit of Turd Mountain. Like always.
Yeah, Winesburg, Ohio, was never like that... but I got something that just might cheer you up.
You got a pilot's license, Marty?
You want to know what I think?
Well... it's a lot easier to swallow without the hair and the foaming jaws. Also, I checked on the otic solution. It was counter brand. No prescription needed.
You're not going to let it go, are you?
The kid is eleven years old and already he sounds like a Jesuit. A French Jesuit.
Okay, so maybe I'm a nun -- so, you want to ask me something?  You want to listen, for once in your little lives? You want to pay some attention?
How are you doing.
Yeah, right to the cops.  No way.
Okay, Christy -- strip.
You are so damn sexy.
You bastard!
We can still see each other.  Just like always.  It's a different kind of sin. Smaller.
No... it's fine.
Is that why you came up here, Christy? To thank me?
She's afraid.  Come on, tell the boys you're afraid.
Oh, girls.
Yes, Betty?
Well, it all comes back, in just a jiffy.  I'm working on a wall-hanging, of the convent.
To sell, of course.  I hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's.  We need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money.
Mary Clarence.  Goose.  We're completely self-supporting.  Like all convents. Like yours.
Hold on.
Two days.  An hour or so.
Right, right, cross with the left, spin and turn!
JUST SING!
What?
I... I brought you something.
A cigarette?
She won't?  Why not?
Mary Clarence!
I don't want to mess anyone up...
Yes, prayer is the answer, and prayers free  We're going to give free prayers to everyone who drives up to this house.
I WAS DOWNHEARTED
Very well.
The reason?
I joined this convent some thirty years ago.  At that time, the world knew some measure of peace.  And hope.  Our order was a beacon of hospitality, to families, to children, to a neighborhood filled with promise.  And, as the years have passed, I have watched that promise destroyed.  Drugs.  Gangs.  Spandex.  And. so I have made this convent an oasis, a retreat from horror. And now that horror has invaded these sacred walls.
What's a concubine?
The vow of obedience.
My what?
Useless distractions.
What's wrong with my life?
Do your recall the words of Saint Peter, in Ecciesiastes 1:27?  He spoke unto a wastrel youth.  He said, "Take up thy task, and know ye the path of contentment."
I don't believe we have anything to say to each other.
You may stay.  But I shall restrict your activities to but a single task.
You will sing, and you will sleep,' that is your schedule until you depart.  As almost no one attends Mass, you will be unable to cause further damage.
What do you mean?
You sent for me?
What?
Then I guess you're stuck.  Life sentence.  No parole.
You have evidenced great maturity, Mary Robert.  We shall have a serious discussion.
What about me, Reverend Mother?  I think you were right.  I'm just a bad influence.  Sister show biz.
A what? When are you qonna wake up?
He didn't do you a favor.
Jesus, what do you think this is -- Wheel of Fortune?  Let me spell it out for you.  You have to hide like you don't even exist.  You have to get so far hidden away that you never see sunlight.
But I'm going insane!  All these people do is pray and work, work and pray!  I don't get it -- when's the weekend? They have gruel, Eddie, that's what they call food!  Gruel -- it's like Alpo for nuns! I sleep in a cell, on a board, and I pray five times a days  Do you know what I pray for, Eddie, do you have any idea? Check your crotch, Eddie --anything fall off yet?  Get me outta her!
Keeping our witnesses alive.  We hide them, but there's a leak in the department, and they end up dead.
What'd she say?
You blew it -- big time.  She doesn't want you back.
So what am I supposed to do in the meantime?
I really can't talk about it now.  The place is packed.  SRO.  I've got a show to do.
I have?
You don't get it!  It's a big thing for them, it's like... Caesar's Palace. Prime-time.  They're singing for the Cardinals.  It's like... "Star Search." If first prize was a trip to the Vatican. They've worked really hard, they deserve this.
People throw stones.  They call me names.  I mean, really.
Jesus.  Data-base hoods.  It's a wonderful world.  Beloved daughter missing.  Reward of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Please find our adored angel, we miss her so.  Dead or alive.
It's a bluff, Vince.
So that guy in the bar was right?  She's like... some kind of nun?
It should be here any minute.
Reverend Mother?
But, Bishop...
We haven't heard your name yet, friend.
They spend two days in chains.
No bleeding.
Bring him.
Stains of blood.
I have everything... last testaments... birth certificates, death certificates... deeds.
Maybe you should take this.
Damn... damn... damn...
Just a moment... if I may.  It is possible this man was murdered.
I could determine if he were dead <u>before</u> he went into the Hudson.
Very few, if any.
These "methods" of yours... there has been no practical application.
Not for lack of trying.
I manage fine alone.
What is the common thread between these victims?
How could he?
The Western Woods.
No, I couldn't...
True enough.
Then, who murdered the Old Crone?  And why?
Someone left last night.  Looked like they headed to the square, but I lost them in the forest.
And it now belongs to you, according to Baltus.  I heard him say it.
In test... what?
Often in such cases, property which has gone intestate legally passes to whomever the deceased was indebted to. And, who in this town is owed a great many debts?
There are no other doors.  This is as far as she could have gone.
What now?  Where is she?
Perhaps it is because your suitor's hands were recently very nearly wrapped around my throat.
He has proposed to me twice.
I've read a great deal about your New York City.  Do be a dear and tell me all about it.  Sounds like an extraordinary place to live a life.
Not all think it is the Horseman. Many say witches come from the Western Woods to steal skulls for their cauldrons.  Some believe a person in this very town kneels before Lucifer, offering death as tribute.  And, still others believe none of it.
I have had them since childhood.  I cannot remember what from.
Yes, but listen.  The illusion is easily explained.  The eye retains each image, till they combine.  And yet, some would call this toy magic.
You promised justice.
Why would you do such a thing?
You falter with your answer because you strive without putting the whole of your heart into it.  Can't you see? You'll bring dignity to the dead even if you have to chop them into little pieces to do it.
Allow me some time.  I have spent every hour in the company of others. I need to be alone.
What?
What happened to your mother?  Is she still alive?
Blood.
The loans give the land to your father. It does not matter survivors are still on their farms.  They could be thrown off... tomorrow... a year from now.
Katrina...
Yes, actually.
Do you know... I think those are the first words I have heard from you my entire time here.
There was not much blood, was there?
Van Ripper, turn the coach about!
May I see my mother?
I like them french-fried potaters.
They give me fifty dollars when they turned me loose. I spent up some of it on ridin' the bus and eatin' french-fried potaters.
Good to see you, Bill. How's everybody doin'?
Well, I've got a roomful of work for him to do. Can't get Scooter to do any of it.
You know better than that. We're on duty. Catch me in that Camaro next week one night.
What?
Well, it's on! We're gonna rock. Linda, call Vaughan. Tell him to get over here. I'd like him to be here. I owe him a good time.
Okay ladies and gentlemen  or both. It's come to the time in our show when we like to introduce the band. Over here on lead guitar Mr. Randy Horsefeathers. Come on hit a hot lick, Randy.  Well, come on, y'all are supposed to clap now. Come on! 
Don't tell me what to do.
How'd your baptizin' go?
Hey, Vaughan, you know what I heard? I heard you been puttin' it to Albert Sellers that works over at the funeral home.
I know Albert. We're friends.
I ain't never used no hatchet that I remember.
How does a feller go about gettin' ahold of the police?
What's you last name?
I did live there in the state hospital.
Yeah. What you doin' by here?
You told me to come by.
How do you know?
Yeah, I remember you a-tellin' me that.
'Cause he didn't have enough money to take care of us the way he wanted to. That's what the letter said. He got laid off from work and had to just work odd jobs. I thought he took care of us fine.  Karl, did you really kill somebody?
I growed up and got taught it ain't right to kill nobody.
You want to go with me?
Hit was right thoughty of her.
What do you mean?
I didn't know till here while back a year or two ago when I spent the night with Ronnie Smart one time. He said just tug on your peter and think about your mama. I tried it, but I felt funny thinkin' about my mama. So, I switched over to thinkin' about his mama and then what he told me would happen, happened. It sure tingles, don't it?
It was alive?
I've studied about it. The Bible says not to or you end up goin' to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades.
I know you could of scored them three touchdowns by yourself instead of throwing 'em over to me.
Karl, I ain't tryin' to say nothin' bad about you, but why don't you stop Doyle when he gets that away? You're older than him. You're strong, too. My daddy wouldn't let him do that to me and Mama.
Okay. I give you my word. Is ever'thing gonna be okay? Are you all right?
How come Karl won't eat here with us?
Did Karl go to bed?
Mama?
I like walkin' quite a bit from time to time.
I'm ye oldest boy name Karl.
I ain't got nothing but them books.
I never was no good with history.
Karl, you up?
Yes sir.
Tolerable, I reckon.
Two fellers was on a bridge a takin' a leak and one feller says the water was cold and the other said it was deep water. One of 'em came from Arkansas, I believe.
Do you reckon you can make me some biscuits?
Mustard's good on 'em to me.
Karl, why don't you and Melinda go take a walk. It's nice out.
We sure like havin' you.
It's been here seventeen years. Did you live here before or something?
Is that right?  Are you going to be staying here long?
I reckon not.
Okay.
What about you, Karl? Do you want to stay here?
Let's just go, Marsha.
Nice to meet you. I'm Marsha Dwiggins and this is Theresa Evans. She's here to take the pictures.
I think there must have been a little mix up. I told your sponsor or teacher or whatever he is, there couldn't be any pictures. It's s'posed to be just a little story or article or something, isn't that right?
I don't know what to tell you. I'm sorry. I made myself pretty clear I thought. He probably got busy and wasn't thinking. I know how that is. I used to teach shop and eighth grade science.
I don't think so. Just period, I think. She told him... God gave them the ugliest creation he could think of. Karl has an entire book -- a notebook. On every page it says "Franklin Chapter 1 Verse number 1." He wrote that a few years ago after he'd learned to write. His father's name was Franklin.
I didn't mean that.
It's coming along. At the rate he's going, he'll have a story finished by the end of the summer.
Will that be cash or charge?
And the bookstore? Have you been working there long?
What else. Of course, what else? And what are you writing about for your thesis?
I get off for lunch in ten minutes. Can I treat you to a hamburger?
What's the difference?
The boys and I were just having a philosophical discussion about women and cigars. Some interesting connections there, don't you think?
I didn't know you took pictures.
I don't know, it just came to me. It's my corner, after all. It's just one little part of the world, but things happen there, too, just like everywhere else. It's a record of my little spot.
It's kind of overwhelming.
Hey, Auggie, I've just been thinking. You wouldn't need some help around the store, would you? Some summer help while Vinnie's gone?
He's crazy.
Nice machine, Auggie. Where'd you find it?
Two, right?
Fine.  Or it was until a couple of days ago. A guy from The New York Times called and asked me to write a Christmas story. They want to publish it on Christmas Day.
So. Are we ready?
She probably died.
What do you mean?
No I'm not. I look like shit. And so do you, Ruby. You look just awful.  What's with the patch, anyway? What'd you do with that old blue marble -- hock it for a bottle of gin?
I don't want to talk about it.  If you really want to know. I lost it. And I'm not sorry I did. That eye was cursed, Auggie, and it never gave me nothing but grief.
Help, huh? And I don't suppose this help has anything to do with money, does it?
It means "happiness."
It was over with Bill before you ever came home. Maybe you don't remember it now, but you were pretty hot to see me back then.
Get in, Auggie. I've got something to show you.
You what?
That I wasn't bullshitting you, sweetheart. At least you'll know I've been telling the truth.
Wait till you see her, Auggie.
And what's that supposed to mean?
So you're just going to give up and go home?
Dream on, Auggie. She'll be lucky to make it to her nineteenth birthday.
No you're not.
Fuck this angel shit. Just take the dough, Ruby. But no bawling, okay? I can't stand people who blubber.
Okay. I think everything's set.  You've got the number for Cape Cod, right? Just in case something goes wrong.
Lovely.
Tobacco today, sex tomorrow. In three or four years, it'll probably be against the law to smile at strangers.
Speaking of which, are you still going ahead with that deal on the Montecristos?
They come in, they go out. I've got it planned to the last detail.
A job?  I definitely wouldn't turn down a job.
It'll never be finished.
When I tell you it's open. It's open when I tell you it's open!
The refrigerator?
What does that mean?
The damn lock's broken again.  And so you just barge in on strangers, is that what you do? Is that your game?
Thomas Cole. Thomas Jefferson Cole. My nephew.
He goes to John Jay High School in Brooklyn.
Why don't you pick some other spot? It gives a man the creeps to be stared at all morning.
I don't know what you look like, boy. As far as I can tell, you sprouted up like a mushroom in this spot last night.  You live in this town -- or on your way from here to there?
It'll cost you five bucks.
I'll tell you what. You want to work. I'll give you a job. Nothing permanent, mind you, but that upstairs room over there  -- the one above the office -- is a hell of a mess. It looks like they've been throwing junk in there for twenty years, and it's time it got cleaned up.
Is there a benefits package, or are you hiring me on a freelance basis?
I don't know. I try. Every day I keep on trying, but it's no easy task for a man to change his nature.  I'm off the booze, though. Haven't had a drop in six years. And now I've got me a wife. Doreen. Best damned woman I've ever known.  And a little boy, too. Cyrus Junior.  So things have definitely improved since I got fitted with this hook. If I can just turn this goddamn garage around, I'll be in pretty good shape.
Be nice, sweetie. We're just here to help you.
Yeah? And why is that?
Okay, joke about it. I don't give a shit.
Of course there's gonna be a war. You think they'd send five hundred thousand troops over there just to lie in the sun? I mean, there's plenty of beach, but not a hell of a lot of water. Half a million soldiers. It ain't no seaside holiday, you can bet on that.
Tick-tock, tick-tock.
Watch out, man. You'll get yourself killed like that.
No harm done. Everything's okay now.  I've got to be going.
Look, kid, it's okay with me. You don't have to play games. If you want a hamburger or something, go ahead and order it.
You don't know me from a hole in the wall.
Here and there. Around.
Uh-huh. One of those cozy bed and breakfast places, probably.
This is the first house I've been in without a TV.
I used to have one, but it broke a couple of years ago and I never got around to replacing it.  I'd just as soon not have one anyway. I hate those damn things.
I didn't ask to come here. You invited me, remember?  If you want me to leave, all you have to do is say so.
It looks like they've met in this apartment.
Let's not get too idealistic.
You work too hard, you know that?
Once a story gets hold of you, it's hard to let go.  Besides, I'm making up for lost time.
The inspiration.
Hey, hey. Happy birthday. Why didn't you tell me?
Here we are.  Rembrandt's drawings. Edward Hopper. Van Gogh's letters.
Yeah, I picked it up.
And started to run.
Good thinking.
You have one hell of a knack for getting into trouble, don't you?  So how much does it come to?
So you robbed the robbers, and now the robbers are after you.
It was more complicated than that. There was a reason.
Well?
Hi, kid.
Hot coffee or iced coffee?
Do you have real iced coffee, or do you just pour hot coffee over some ice cubes?
Yes, please.
And the blood could <u>not</u> have belonged to defendant.  Seeing that his type is O negative.
Bits of blood and wood.  What else would there be?
No bits of bone, no particles of scalp, no strands of hair?
That he'd keep an eye on Miyamoto. Watch out for him.
We hear how Carl...passed away. Only a few hours later.
You thought the deceased might... break his promise?
Because the facts could be misconstrued as murder.
We were afraid.  Silence seemed better.  To come forward seemed like a mistake.
It's just Pearl Harbor.  People are a little crazy, right n...
Did you write that column?
And the next one...?
So if defendant had tied up to deceased's boat.  With that last one.  Would those cleats have lined up?
You bet.  And if Miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off, he coulda left this line behind on Carl's boat.
But isn't the <u>truth</u> that there are <u>several</u> other ways to explain <u>each</u> of these twelve pieces.
And I wouldn't blame these good people if they were a mite resent- ful.  At a tactic that insults their intelligence.
Mr. Jurgensen.  Did he offer to <u>buy</u> the seven acres from you?
And then your stroke came this summer.  And you put your property on the market, I believe you said September 7.  Which, remember, is <u>eight</u> days before Carl Heine died. And who comes Spetember 7, wanting to buy?
Here now, what are you fixin' to do?
Well, why does it?
Still lashed to the mast.
Maybe...?
Maybe Carl picks up something about the freighter on his radio, which is now working.  Same report Milholland heard.  And <u>that</u> makes him get the lantern fast.  Before the freighter's wake can bang it around.
Cigarette?
See you replaced a mooring line, lately.  This one's new.
White or black?
Maybe the assailant straightened the cabin.  And forgot the cup.
Didn't think about it at the time. So no, it didn't strike me odd.
Does it now?
He's done some on-the-spot refit- ting.  You could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the D-6.
Even though a D-6 is too big, and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in.  Which makes it a peculiar choice. For a spare.
Can I say something, here?
...He used to say, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."
Melton, on the double!  Up a chain!                                   MELTON  Sir!     MELTON takes a few easy strides, gracefully catches a chain mid- stride, and smarts up, climbing easily and twice as fast as TODD.     CHURCH, SLOAN, and RUBRICK crane their necks as the two men struggle upward toward the rafters.     Three quarters of the way up, MELTON comes even with TODD, then passes him. MEKUM, watching, smirks.     CHURCH is watching too, and he's still not satisfied.  His brow is knit, something's bothering him.     ANGLE HIGH ABOVE, AMONG THE GIRDERS     Stonefaced, MELTON is resting an a "platform" on the chain, sixty feet up, beneath the girders, swaying gently.     His stony gaze is on the next chain where TODD is arriving at a "platform" on an adjacent chain...only three feet away.     Their eyes meet, TODD and MELTON alone together sixty feet up, three feet apart.  Neither man blinks, neither man flinches, neither man reveals anything at all...     LOW ANGLE, LOOKING UP     CHURCH considers the men high above, then to MEKUM.                                   CHURCH                    What about...spirit?
Are these your bags?
Forget it, doll.  After all, you work here - I work here - and believe you me, it's nice to have you with the organization.
Why?
Funny?  In what way?
Those two musicians from the garage!
How can you be so selfish?  We owe back rent - we're in four eighty-nine bucks to Moe's Delicatessen - we're being sued by three Chinese lawyers because our check bounced at the laundry - we've borrowed money from every girl in the line -
You're right, Joe.
Look at those odds - ten to one. If he wins, we can pay everybody.
Well, that solves one problem.  We don't have to worry about who to pay first.
Of course, the landlady is going to lock us out - Moe said no more knackwurst on credit - and we can't borrow any more from the girls, because they're on their way to jail -
With me?
Don't you remember?  He has this bad tooth - it got impacted - the whole jaw swole up -
You mean it's a girls' band?
I feel so naked.  Like everybody's looking at me.
Who are we kidding?  Look at that - look how she moves - it's like jello on springs - they must have some sort of a built-in motor. I tell you it's a whole different sex.
Bye, Sugar.  We been playing with the wrong bands.
But suppose I lose?  Suppose it's an emergency?
Male and female - the moth and the flame - I ought to slug you!
What happened?
I got pinched in the elevator.
I'm tired of being a flag.  I want to be a bull again.  Lets get out of here, Joe. Let's blow.
So you got pinched in the elevator. So what?  Would you rather be picking lead out of your navel?
You know - the old shell game.
Yes, Mr. Fielding - you'll pick her up after the show in your motorboat - goodbye - what's that you said?  Oh - zowie! I'll give her the message. 
You got it made, kid.  Fielding wants you to have a little cold pheasant with him on his yacht -
With ME?
Come on, you can do better than that. Give him teeth - the whole personality.
Hi, Jerry.  Everything under control?
Have I got things to tell you!
Oh.
That's some nerve!
Joe, if we get out of this hotel alive, you know what we're going to do? We're going to sell the bracelet, and grab a boat to South America and hide out in one of those banana republics -  The way I figure is, if we eat nothing but bananas, we can live there for fifty years - maybe a hundred years - that is, if we get out of the hotel alive.  Did we forget anything?
Hello, my dearest darling.  So good to hear your voice again.
Wait a minute - my bracelet.  What happened to my bracelet?
I'm not crowding you, am I?
That's ridiculous.
Isn't that ridiculous?
I'm a girl, I'm a girl, I'm a girl -
I'm a very sick girl.
What do you think you're doing?
You should have seen me before I went on a diet.
We don't have to run.
Well, I'll come back later.
What do you mean, maybe?  I saw the way he looked at you.  He'll be there for sure.
Did he get fresh?
He's going to South America to marry some other girl - that's what they call high finance.
Brand new.
How did those holes get there?
Yes.  For a whole year.
I was it.
- you got to be blonde -
We could dye our hair.
Hello, Mr. Morris? This is Poliakoff, in Chicago. Say, you wouldn't have a couple of girl musicians available? A sax player and a base?
If there is one thing I admire, it's a girl with a shapely ankle.
Me too.  Bye now.
Mama is keeping score.  Frankly, she's getting rather annoyed with me
Oh, of course.  which of these instruments do you play?
You know something, Mr. Fielding? You're dynamite!
Another bridesmaid?
Why not?
We'll adopt some.
This is her roommate.  Daphne can't talk right now.  Is it anything urgent?
Wait a minute.  Where do you think you're going?
Oh?
Why?
I'm not doing anything.  I just thought I'd go home and have some cold pizza -
What are you - a couple of comedians? Get out of here!  Long distance?  Get me the William Morris Agency in New York.
Have you ever been with a male band?
Rough?
I'll say.
Especially tenor sax.  I don't know what it is, but they just curdle me.  All they have to do is play eight bars of "Come to Me My Melancholy Baby" - and my spine turns to custard, and I get goose-pimply all over - and I come to them.
Every time!
You don't know what they're like. You fall for them and you love 'em - you think it's going to be the biggest thing since the Graf Zeppelin - and the next thing you know they're borrowing money from you and spending it on other dames and betting on the horses -
You know I'm going to be twenty-five in June?
Yeah.  With money like Rockefeller, and shoulders like Johnny Weismuller -
What's happened?
Saxophone player?
I don't think so.
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
They do indeed.  Daddy threatened to cut me off without a cent, but I don't care. It was such a bore - coming-out parties, cotillions -
It's been delightful meeting you both.
Guess!
Do you mind riding backwards? It may take a little longer -
My dad is more interested in railroads. Baltimore and Ohio.  Which is the port and which is the starboard?
Love it.  Which way?
Oh - a member of the herring family.
A herring?  Isn't it amazing how they get those big fish into those little glass jars?
It's the crews' night off.
Have you tried?
How can you think about food at a time like this?
Is it that hopeless?
Have you ever tried American girls?
Is that anything?
What is it?
Oh, no.  I'm off that stuff - for good.
You see, we have those oil interests in Venezuela - and I just got a cable from Dad - the board of directors decided on a merger.
Quite a while.  As a matter of fact, I'm not coming back at all.
Oh - that kind of a merger.  Is she young? Pretty?
Do yourself a favor - go back where the millionaires are - the sweet end of the lollipop - not the cole slaw in the face and the old socks and the squeezed-out tube of toothpaste -
Better bring the check now - in case the joint gets raided.
Quit kidding.  You did that vulcanizing job on Toothpick Charlie - and we know it.
I already told you.
Hello, Charlie.  Long time no see.
Just dropped in to pay my respects.
Did Kat tell you she dumped you because of your funky breath?
What for?
She blames Tony Pee-Pants Pinterello for everything. The fall of the British Empire, the Cold War, the internet.
I was pretty hard on her last night.  And now sheâ€™s getting married.
Other than, heâ€™s shagging your exgirlfriend?
Ah, a philosopher.
No, tell me.
Whoa, Jeffrey. Slow down. You and me, weâ€™re the past. Iâ€™m not sure if you noticed, but Iâ€™m here with someone else.
Itâ€™s called character. God, youâ€™re predictable.
Kat, wait. I donâ€™t want you hating me. Weâ€™ve never had this talk. You know how crap I am at this.
Not for a dog.
Sorry. Iâ€™m a little nervous. I never thought something like this would happen to me.
Is this for last night?
But nothing did.
He was about to un-stick me!  I paid you to help me get closure.
Besides, you hired me for my discretion.
You didnâ€™t have to do that.
I always wondered what happened with us.
Sheâ€™s drunk. -er than me. But I didnâ€™t really dump you, did I?
I am now, sir.
Best thing about being a dad is when your kid starts kicking your ass--
Thank you, Miss Johnson.
You got a pretty house, Miss Johnson!
Dr. William E. B. Dubois. 
But you did all you could, David. Not many little boys could've gone on such a journey as you did.
How was your sister after you pulled her out of the water?
We didn't find Sounder yet.
Goodnight, Daddy...
Where's everybody?
Wheeew! This is some hard work, but it beats goin' to jail.
When's that?
Sunday...
Who is they?
No mam -- I looked all over.
What is it, David Lee?
I can do it, Mama -- you know that. In the Bible stories you read to us, everybody's always goin' on a long journey. Jacob goes into a strange land where his uncle is and he don't even know where he lives, but he finds him. Everybody finds what they supposed to find.
Did you find your father?
Don't pout now, David, it's a long trip.
Rebecca, you jest the one I wanta see.
That's one dollar an' twenty cents.
You sure you feel up to it, Nathan?
To the commissary to get this boy some clothes! I'm gon' get everybody somethin'!
Shore thing -- next week sometime, and as soon as I git the day, I'll ride out and let you know 'bout it.
Of COURSE!! Ice cream!!
BECAUSE IT'S EVIL!!
Patient 453 here has been fitted with the new v-chip...
Notice that nothing happens.  Now say 'Montana.'
OW!! That HURT GOD DAMMI-
That's right, Mr. Garrison. The environment is what surrounds us. It is what we live and breathe.
They're burning all the Canadian stuff cause of the war.
Fuck that!  AGAGH!!
Okay.
Who the hell made up that law?!
This is all cause of your mom, Kyle. She's such a bitch-  AGH!! I mean - she's such a... meanie.
Tell 'em we'll have pie and punch.
More people will come if they think there'll be pie and punch!
Mom...
Ugh... You guys, seriously... I'm having Cheesy Poof withdrawal...
Mph mph.
Mph rmph rm rmph rmph rm!
Yeah, I guess.
Gwpaapa. Gwpaapa.
Oh, brother.
Dude, I found the clitoris! I think I can get Wendy to like me now!
Whew, I'm sure glad that's over.
What did my son say, Principal Victoria? Did he say the S word?
No, it was worse than that...
My mother sent YOU a letter? What's it say?
YOU'D fuck your uncle!
HA HA HA! You burned yourself to death by lighting the fart! HA HA HA!!
Hello, Conan!
Phillip, this is worse than that trip to Quebec City when I fell asleep in that disco.
Did you hear that, Terrance? I farted!
Yeah!  YEAH!!!  Man I'm getting so HOT!!!
Help you? You've destroyed my life and now you want me to help you?!  You're always making me feel like a piece of shit.
Ow, you're hurting me!
Stan... I think you and I need some time apart.
Sure, Stan! How did you know I loved ice cream?
You don't have watches?
Check.
Jesus, come on!
Anna Koros. She sensually extends her hand, Warren shakes it -
So, what brings you out here?  Pleasure cruise?
Well, it was nice meeting you. Enjoy the rest of the trip.
Weren't you down in the dining room?
And what are they doing now, Mac?
I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.
Well, everything's running smoother than a baby's ass.
Why, didn't they say?
That's very pragmatic of you, Barnes.
Well, maybe I will.  You sure you don't want anything?
If anyone can hear me please respond!
Barnes, can you hear me, are you all right?
It's time we lock coordinates.
This ship is going down in a blaze of glory!
Well blaze your ass out of there! You've completely altered your trajectory, are we linking up or not?!
Yeah, I guess money don't buy class.
Well, more power to you.  Me, I start to bug out after too much time out here.
We don't.
It depends on the condition of the ship.  If I could get to one of the suit compartments I could check the exterior air locks for a possible entry.
Seen one like it before?
Why can't we?
We could send Mac.  If he can retrieve one suit, we could go back for the other.
I don't know what we're facing.
Taylor?
Don't worry about what will happen, just concentrate on what is happening.  You'll live longer.
What's that?
What?  What are you talking about?
I'm in the bridge.
I'll do my best.
Hopefully sooner than later.
What the hell are you doing?
I'm going back for Taylor!
Homesick?  It's only been two days!
That will not be necessary.  You can simply speak to me.  I understand most languages fluently.
Yeah but the ship's mainframe doesn't. I need you to tell it something.
Now Mac, can you tell me the status of this deck?
Hey, cut it out Sid, that tickles. I'm serious! You guys are related, right?
Hey, ain't I seen you on the tour?
Hey, you still here?
Buzz Burger, side of 'cues. You haven't introduced me to your fan.
You're a bullshit artist, that's what you are. You got no right to be here! Theo yanks the trophy away from Buzz.
I'm your blood.
I was beaten on a shot named after my own dad. The moment passes. Theo turns and climbs into his car. He looks up at Buzz.
Thanks, kid.  Where are you goin' now?
Hello, mom?
Uh...over easy.
What did your dad tell you to do to Buzz? Theo scrambles up the lane on hands and knees. Junior catches him, grabbing his ankles.
He told me to play Blue-Face with Buzz. I like games.
We're having a party for you, boy. Cake and shish-k-bob, just like you love. Junior cringes away from the light.
Weird, comes into alleys and doesn't bowl.
I heard you've been having a little trouble with the Congress.  Theo pulls his eyes off Sheila. Kastle walks Theo past pairs of bowlers.
You might say I'm at the top of their shit list.
Maybe I can help you.  Try a lighter ball, Penelope - you'll get hurt with that big ball, honey.  I've seen tapes of you bowling on the circuit. You got Fazeli blood running through you. Your pop was a genuine talent in his day.
What's with the bad air between you two, Mr. Kastle?
Profits down there, philanthropy up here.  Besides, it beats the pants off bingo.
You need a sponsor; I have influence. I could sponsor you.
You already have a partner Mr. Kastle. Sheila walks over as the sleazeballs' car pulls out of the driveway.
That's why Mom ran away, because you had to control everything!
Fantastic! What talent.
132, 154.
Who wants to know?  Zeus!
Uh...over easy.
Business.
The mental hospital.
Whoa.
The ladies in Akron call them thigh- ticklers.
I'd rather you didn't.
Ha! And what do you have to do for him?
Do you talk with your mom?
I bet you get to meet a lot of eligible bowlers.
More than you could afford.
It wouldn't bother you if Buzz was in danger, would it?
I'm sure you wouldn't care if he needed your help, right?
I can't tell you, Theo.
I can't - I can't do it.  He's my brother.
You should.
Where are you going?
When I'm with you Sheila, I don't even think about bowling. Theo takes Sheila in his arms and kisses her passionately. She stops him and looks around nervously.
You think I'm dumping you to get back into bowling. Well who's dumping who?
You bet. For five bucks, I'll even throw in the tongue.
There's heat coming the door.
I said back away.
I am not leaving without him.  Do you hear me?  We come down as a team, we leave as a team.
Norman!
A squid?  The size of a whale?  I don't think so.  Target acquired.  Sixty yards.
Sure.  Each time it started fires inside the habitat.
What was that?
Increase positive pressure!
How deep is he?
What team?
Like "Thou shall not kill"?
You mean, what's in that thing is immortal?
Look, the ships are clearing out. They're taking us topside in a matter of minutes.  Someone can check him out there, if it's that imprtant.
A while back, Beth and I -- we worked at the same university.  She was assisting a chemist there -- I forget his name -- doing research, experiments.  She was also living with him.  Yeah, I know.  And when she finished her work, he kicked her out, broke off the relationship, and published five papers -- all her work -- without any thank you or acknowledgement.
If something should happen to us, the Navy will at least have partial records of what happened.
Yes, I do.  Whatever's out there, I think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier.
Bullshit.  What's out there isn't alien.  It's an animal.
What?
To conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere.
Gimme a report, I want --
She's not gonna know.
Ted, get her away from the door.
We had considered it.
That's quite a secret.
Do yourself a favor, Norman.  Are you listening?  Don't tell anyone what you just told me.
What are they?
Calm down, Beth.  Alright?
Don't do this.
Forget the sub.
We must've had it delivered then.
When did the messages start?  The animals outside start showing up? After Harry came out of the sphere.
Which I told Barnes was attacking --
And that's the part of Harry that's being manifested.
Ulcers.
Tranquilizer.  Causes drowsiness.
Bingo.
Antihistamine.  For bites.
I'll just boost the doses.
You ever given an injection before.
I'm sorry.
Where are you?
You know what I mean.
Are you manifesting them?
C'mon -- what?
Am I lying?  Are you sure?  Are you absolutely sure I'm lying?  Then explain to me about the jellyfish.  Earlier.  Why did we see jellyfish?  Harry doesn't fear jellyfish.  You do.  They're your fear, aren't they?
You remember before you picked him up -- when you looked up at the sphere, you remember that -- when the sphere opened?  That's right.  But you can't remember going inside, can you?  No, of course not.  Harry couldn't either, could he?  "Like everything's on the tip of my tongue", he said.
But I have to, Norman.
Well, what's your theory?
All that banging and pounding.  I don't know.  We should think about making a good first impression.
Jerry.  Right.  I said Jerry, didn't I?
Why are you looking at me like that?
No idea.  We have no surface support. It transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater.
Fine.  I'm fine.
I'm completely serious.  There is something very important missing from that spacecraft.  You know what that is?
I don't follow you.
So, <u>we know</u>.  We know it went through a black hole.  We saw it.  Norman -- when we'd get to the surface, we'd tell someone about the black hole, wouldn't we?  It'd go in some report like some big discovery.  So in fifty years when they build that ship, they'd make precautions for a black hole.  <u>But they didn't</u>.  The called it an Unknown Entry Event.
Am I?
You were all supposed to leave.  You weren't supposed to stay down here.
Norman?
Don't do this.  Don't psychoanalyze me.  I hate squid.  Period.  Just like you hate jellyfish.
Did I?
I can't breathe...  Am I... clear?
You didn't say that about the food?
Navy transmission.  They're sent from Wisconsin.
Think about it.
Meaning?
See?  No code.  What'd I say?
It's over, sir, The storm has cleared.
Any other bags, Dr. Johnson?
You mean a picture?
Squint harder.
Try this one.
What was it?
You seen my suitcase?
Don't be so supportive, honey.
We have to find he rebels... What we're carrying belongs to them.
Who's going to pay me then?
You have your father's style.  You've done very well.
Darth Vader is on this system.  I can feel him.  I can feel the Kiber Crystal.
You saw through me?
Luke, I'm coming along to do what I can, but I'm tired and I'm depending on you to get us through.
Don't you have a Kiber crystal?
That's where my father was killed.
Do the Sith know the ways of the Force?
Like Bogan weather, or bogan times. I thought that was just a saying.
Are you sure you don't need it?
But she is the only link between us and the hidden bases.
I can't do it.  I'll get hit.
See, once you let yourself go you can do it.  You'll get it.
You go after the princess. I am an old man and would be of little help.  I must try to find the Crystal.
Who's the pilot?
Between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, the entire city is going to know we're here.
I noticed you were having some problems, Blue Five... I thought I'd help.
No!...
I am Luke Starkiller at your service.
Are there medical facilities on Yavin?
But you promised!  I've saved enough money and now you have the extra help ... you promised!
That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning...
Let him have it.  You're winning anyway.  It doesn't make any difference.
I read you sir.
You're back.  What happened?  Never mind.  What's going on?
Are you safe?
Are you there, sir?  We're going...
Thank you, sir.  Your kindness is greatly appreciated, but if it's at all possible, Artoo and I would like to remain in your service.
You got some guts for a rich kid. I guess you and me could be buddies.
Funny how they always want to be your friends after they kick your guts out.
It's what I deserve.
Mobile Infantery rules !
We'll take this high ground. Lookouts there and therte and up there. If the bugs come upstairs in this neighbor-hood, we'll be the first to know.
The Roughnecks are always ready, sir.
You always told me you couldn't do human...
I'm all ears.
It's amazing, us running into each other like this. Maybe it's fate.
Or...?
No, I replotted the course. It's more efficient this way.
She got a command... and she thinks we oughta team up officially and crew for her. She thinks we're good together.
Fleet encourages marriages among flight officers. You'd probably get a promotion out of it.
I thought I was dead. Lucky for me you jokers showed up, eh ?
Zander, what are you doing ?
Well, if your dad doesn't like me, how come we're such good friends ?
No, I mean if he can get in, maybe I have a chance.
He's nothing like you.
I love you, Carmen.
Shhhh...!
What happened to your hair ?
What do you think ? Everyone did it when we got our wings. You don't like it, do you ?
Should I be ?
...I'm sorry.
You look so... I don't know, you look like you've really been in it.
Almost got knocked out of the sky over Big K.
Pilot Trainee Ibanez reporting for duty, ma'am.
Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen...
It stinks, you goin.
C'mon...
No, you're gonna be alright, Diz !
Johnny, people get hurt... people get killed in the Federal Service. If something happened to you I don't know what I would do...
Oh, my, what's that ?
Owen reported the eradication of a low generation colony a month ago. That's why MICOM wants onsite assessment.
Take your group down to P and have a look see. Leave the thinking to us, Lieutenant. That's not your job.
Which do you think is more important, courage or confidence ?
Hello... Oh, Johnny...!
We're outa here. Lieutenant, get your men into the skimmers. This real estate's about to go buggy.
Don't be a hero...
What is your position ?
Enterprise would be unable to function <U>without</U> carbon units.
You said V'ger's purpose was to find and join with the Creator.
V'ger is announcing that it has arrived, sir -- that it's ready to deliver the information it was programmed to collect...
Deck four, Captain; Officers' Quarters...!
Then you acted properly, of course.
Well, Mr. Decker, it seems my bluff is being called.
And plug the signal directly into the circuitry at this...  ... point here, Captain. It should pick up even a tricorder playback.
It's a programmed <U>mechanism</U>, Mr. Spock...
Then V'ger believes the Creator to be a <U>machine</U> too.
And in you, too, Lieutenant.
Time to impact...?
Mr. Sulu, steady as she goes.
Reduce magnification. Factor 4, Mr. Sulu.
One hundred kilometers...
Viewer ahead.
I still contain fragments of my human half.
And whatever you sensed out here....
We cannot break free, Captain.  We do not have a fraction of the power necessary.
It would appear that the atomic arrays of these crystals store information. A remarkably efficient system.
What should you have known?
No meaning... No hope...  And, Jim, no answers...! Jim, it's looking for <U>answers</U> <U>itself</U>!
Child...!?
Spock, we <U>were</U> its answer!
Why aren't you on board?
Which will require twenty more hours at minimum, Admiral...
Captain, it was our anti-matter imbalance that created the wormhole in the first place. It will happen again if we don't correct it.
That object out there is less than two days from Earth, Mister Scott. We've got to intercept while it still is out there!
I'll be there.
You haven't heard of it.
That's good.  That's really good.  You have a gift for words.
It's about life.
Yes.
In fact, in fact, in fact, I'm not sure if I'm giving <u>them</u> a second chance, or they're giving it to me.  That's the truth.  The truth's best, don't you think?
It's in your script...it's about getting a second chance.  Innit?  "You <u>can</u> go back..."
What happened?
You like kids?
Paperclip?
Gonna' be good as new.
Read the card.
Later on.
You, um, you, um, you going out with your fiance?
So is our electoral process.  But we still vote.
Do you truly believe the electoral process is absurd?
Ah.  Ah.  Ah...
...her unbridled sexuality.  That he...
Hi.
Yes...
Now you're talking...
They'll...they'll <u>blackball</u> me...
What are you going to do?
What, what what are you doing here?
Hi!
We had a date.
I've been thinking.
It's all over between us, Doug, I'm sorry, but that's the truth.  I've found someone else, and, it's very serious and it's the end.  I'm sorry.  It isn't <u>you</u>, j...
I'm sorry.
Maude, this <u>man</u> wrote this <u>play</u>!
Mornin', Doc...
Courthouse back in town.
Fourteen year old girls.
Hey, Tommy.  Heard your wife's having a baby.
...I was just talking to that girl in the other room.
Stay ready.  Stay by yourself in your room.
No, I was, I was, I was just <u>learning</u> on, it's a...
That makes a <u>lot</u> of sense, Claire, that makes a lot of...list...listen, cause the audience isn't <u>coming</u> to see your breasts.  They are coming to see you <u>act</u>. What are you doing this evening...?
The prices are going up.
Nice town that you've got here.
You want to see it better, we could go out on the roof.
Her...
No, you're absolutely r...
I'm very sorry to...
I'm an attorney, if there's anything you have to say to...
...I have to give you this <u>ticket</u> for damage to city property.  I'm really sorry, Sir, it's a formality, I hope you'll excuse...
It's night.
I wasn't in the car.
You have no right to...
I, actually yes.
Why?
But we...
We're just talking about the...
This scene is why I'm doing the movie. "Look at the mill, Frank -- look at the way it goes around...<u>half</u> of the time the darned wheel's under water, but..."
You can't do what?
...<u>no</u>, they don't...
We, we have to give it.
An artist of your caliber...
I know what you are, I am <u>so</u> sorry that you...when I read that script I said there's only one person to play that part.
I know...
That's cor...
I can't tell.
Uh.  Bob Barrenger, fella, <u>Cameraman</u>...
Well you guess what.  The Mayor sent me. I have your Mr. Barrenger with a history of...
Mmmm.  You have children?
You should.
I can't find the writer.
My wife is going to have a baby, and...
Halo?  <u>Marty</u>?  What would they have used instead of an old mill?  We need it tonight.  Marty?  Yeah you were saying...?
I have to tell the truth.
What did you say to them...?
I don't know.
I was walking down the street...I remember, I was writing a...
...the house, the 1835.  The original <u>kitchen</u>, of course, burned in 1960, as part of a spate of fires...
We don't have the money.
<u>Find</u> it.
Is that one hell of a kid?
Mmm.
Dear, this is Mr. Rossen, he is the producer...
...we need the shooting permit for Main Street...
<u>Whatever</u> you need.  The City Council, of course, has to pass on your...
Well, these things happen.  <u>Purpose</u> of my call, my wife wanted to know what brand of <u>cigarettes</u> Mr. Barrenger smokes, so she could lay some out tonight...we got the list of his dietary <u>requirements</u>...
...we can't lose the wind...
Well Daddy and I were thinking that sometimes people tell a story about what they wish would happen.
Maybe you're upset that Rachel moved in.
You wouldn't kiss him, huh?
Annabelle...wake up honey...
Are you afraid for me?  Where I'm going.
No.  I told you.  I like apple butter not butter butter.
What I meant and perhaps I didn't say it well was you have a great mom.  You don't need another one.  But when you're at this house --
This is my house too!
I <u>did</u> what she said.  I <u>used</u> my words, I <u>told</u> him what I <u>felt</u>, and they...
In high school.
You touched it.
Then have a donut --
'In the still...still of the ni-ight...I held you... held you so ti-ight'...take it, man...
Why does Rachel wear Daddy's underpants? Doesn't she have underpants of her own?
Queen of diamonds.
Ben, mommies work too.  They work very hard.  Mommy works harder as a mom than she did when she was working.  I just don't get paid.
Rache says I have to eat <u>lamb</u>.  I told her <u>you're</u> making me <u>spaghetti</u>!
Grammy had a different kind. There are lots of kinds.  Hers was very bad.
Ben!  Mommy's so glad to see you -- Now stop climbing!  Ben listen to me...
No!  I have to get there.
Where Ben?
Okay.  These are good.
Can I talk to you?  When you're there.
Cooper, back the fill off I don't have enough shadow...
So we'll...radiate some more?
Thank you Mrs. Franklin.  Jackie?  This has been very valuable for us.  And I'll have a serious talk with Annabelle tonight.
I'm not gonna wait around to see the next one.  I'm not gonna watch my kids fall through the cracks of this arrangement.  I'm seeing a lawyer.
I had a lot of treatments, and they weren't any fun, but the tests show the cancer got smaller.
We don't have any coffee.
What happened with Annabelle?  Has nothing I said gotten through to you?
Did you or Luke talk to her about it afterwards?
...in.
Why not just bring the whole toilet?
I'm sorry, I just...
Jackie?
Look, you've never liked me...
She hasn't mentioned this.
Right.  Which is the whole <u>point</u> of this 'going out' thing, so one of them can dump the other one, and they can imitate the whole passionate adult soap opera tragedy, without ever having to actually date.
Can I look at the pictures?
I really look like shit.
He's relentless.  A <u>major</u> asshole.
Eat your heart out.  Is Annabelle there?
Looks nice enough to m...
Is that what you're worried about? Looking bad at the PTA?
Aw.
She was beaten, and bloodied, and it was going to go on, uni...
Thanks for coming out.
You're lying.
I lost him.  I was panicked.
Everything.  You're...the Earth Mother incarnate...
It was a veal stock, I thi...
Oh right...So it's just complicated for you and Jackie -- for me it's pretty simple cause I just don't understand...
Okay...Is that the good thing or the bad thing?
'But keep dancing, and if you're lucky, I might just never leave, who knows?'
Does Jackie know this?
Hey.
Like what?
And thank you for dressing up for us. This is very classy. Tell us. What kind of professional plans do you have? What's in your future?
You have a bay?
He's dead.
No, you don't.
This is definitely better.
You've got a family tragedy on your hands. Will you tell me what's funny about that? About a kid in a coma?
I mean, why are you making this documentary if you can't treat your subject with appropriate gravity?
Marty...
Well, I changed the ending a little.
Well then, maybe you should just read the ending.
What do you want?
Which is it? You gotta keep your focus straight.
But what kind of pull did you have?
That's good.
...gger.
Well, I mean...I wanna be on TV. Maybe have a talk show or something. Like Conan. Or early Letterman.
Toby -? Oh, hi! How are you?
I'm a documentary filmmaker.
N-not yet. I'm hoping to get a grant for this one project on teenagers. Geez, remember when we were teenagers?
I do.
Yeah...um...so anyway, tell me. What about you? I'd heard through the grapevine you were producing movies.
Yeah. But not any more.
Yeah.
Yeah, sure.
Pretty cool, Stanley.
No...Actually, I'm a documentary filmmaker?
Well get someone down there!
Is he with the girl?
Let's move it we got company!
After Leizburg, he stuck his neck out to defend me.  He's loyal to the end. Even if it's not--politically correct at the time.
Let me tell you something Cooper! I never once bad-mouthed him during all those months--
Now what?
How well do you know this place?
I don't want any...
Of course it's codified!  Each number probably corresponds to a compound.  Have them pull every compound from the lab and compare it to the codes till you figure it out--that's what you're here for.
We're almost done piping in directly to the Olympia.  Should have it all in about an hour or so.
Good.
Agreed--let's move it.
Why should I worry?  Is there a problem?
Well, there was uh, a little dissent about the amount of the bonus--
Are we adrift--
Drop the anchor!
War-mongering bully!  Don't think you're going to intimidate me!
The source was...shall we say, completely reliable.
We'll have to leave that up to the C.I.D. boys, won't we, Major?
Look, Colonel.  I've got to talk to somebody at Air Command.
But that would mean some of our own boys will get hurt, Mister President.
What do you suppose is going to happen if General Ripper's planes start bombing their targets?
I don't know, sir. We just spoke a few minutes ago.
Do you remember what Clemenceau once said about war?
He said war was too important a matter to be left to Generals.
I guess so.
But war doesn't make sense precisely because the weapons can kill an entire country -- right?
Right.
I was just going to say, as long as the weapons exist, sooner or later something's going to happen -- and that'll be it for both countries.
Don't be offended, Major.  Our President holds the same views.
And I suppose there's some reason why you haven't recalled them?
Mister President, I know you think I've let you down, but we had to have a Plan-R.  If we completely centralized the command and control, all a potential aggressor would have to worry about was knock- ing out maybe half a dozen headquarters and the Capitol, and we'd be out of business. We'd have planes and missiles just sitting there while we were getting clobbered.
How long will it take to receive them all?
I believe it will be just a few minutes, at the most.
I'm not certain, Mister President.  But I believe it was four.
Give me a first rough course as soon as you can, Lieutenant Ballmuff.
Roger, maintain.
We should be crossing the coast in about six minutes.
They must have clobbered some of our cities already!
Main interference linked to electronic detector.  Fight interference on readi- ness state.
Just the missiles.
They must have been fired from Bromdingna - probably one of their new Vampire - 202's. They've got a range well over a hundred miles.
Between Mach 3 and 4.
Shouldn't be bad.  Might even help.  But my guess is we're going to have to paddle our way back.
Lieutenant Quiffer, we're all sorry you were hit, and we'll help you stick it together as soon as we get squared away.
They must have made a visual contact.
What does it look like?
Bomb doors circuit is green, bomb release circuit is green, bomb fusing circuit is green.
Release first safety.
Primary bomb is live.
The CRM-114 is smashed, right?
You're giving them an awful lot of credit for being on the ball.
First lesson in War College:  Never under- estimate your enemy.
Are you sure?
But I get a red light.
Let me check.
It would not be difficult.  Nuclear reactors could provide power almost indefinitely. Greenhouses could maintain plant life. Animals could be bred and slaughtered. A quick survey would have to be made of all the suitable minesites in the country, but I shouldn't be surprised if several hundred thousand of our people could be accomodatedd. Every nation would undoubtedly follow suit.
But, look here, Von Klutz.  Won't this nucleus of survivors be so shocked, grief-stricken, and anguished that they will envy the dead, and indeed, not wish to go on living?
Um-hm.
In Group?
Slides go with it.
Typical male.
Want a beer?  Is Pony coming?
Hey, you said you did a video?
A cloud?
Yeah. There was this cloud and I video taped it.
Your a nurse?
Oh, some of 'em. But it's mostly just strokes and shit. I mean, most of 'em just sleep all the time and get kind of yellow. Usually they die id they're, you know, really yellow.
Mm. Hey, what are you doing now?
Yeah.
But, so, Pony's comin' by here to the corner?
I don't know. Later. I don't know.
Oh, I'll bet you he has a babe with him right out of a triple-x video. Oh, oh, Pony, come on, give it to me! Stud! Oh!
That sounds so great, man. Yes. Yes. Hey, what would you do in the afternoon?
A long, long, long...
Sure.
No, I mean, no one.
Yeah, I should've stuck up for you, man, I know. You're my friend, she's your old lady.
Buff, can you listen to me for a second?
Yeah, that's what I'm trying to tell you. That chick Erica?
What, they're looking for her?
What?
She's dead.
No, no, no.
Oh, really? You wanna go look?
Yeah, man.
Yeah.
Come on.
In what way?
Oh, how did you get burnt-out?
Are you talking to me?
Naw, naw, we don't have time for all that.
You make videos?
I could.
You were a shitty lineman and now your a shitty cop. Yeah, blow me, I'm drunk.
Will you stand up for me?
So you came by to see how the other half lives, huh? Well, here we are, What do you think? Pretty fucking pathetic huh? Kind of like one of those documentaries on educational TV?
Hi.
So you, like, come from a town like this or...?
No, not really. Middle-class.
What was your name again?
I know. It's okay.
Taking care of business.
I'd love to read that.
Erica, you coming?
Two-fifty.
He's drunk.
You don't need to sit next to me right now.
Yeah. Yeah, no, you're right. It's no big deal, you know. Guy probably has his arm around her right now, holding her close, nudging her titty with his elbow, talking about the deep significance of his music, while she looks up at him with her big brown eyes. In a few minutes they'll be back at the Four Seasons. You ever, you ever stayed in one of those places?
That chick, Erica?
Come on. You don't think that after they called the cops on me, her and Mohammed had a nice laugh?
Why we're just standing here.
Was that supposed to be me?
Yeah, man, male, significant other, whatever the fuck I am.
No, sweetie. Cynicism is bullshit.
I stand for honesty! I stand for some level of truth!
You know, all you know is what's good for you.
How?
Jeff. Jeff.
My goal is to make art.
So, what, why can't you do that here? What's wrong with here? Why is somewhere else better?
Mm-mm.
But wait! Sooze, I don't wanna fight. I'm so sorry.
Yes, Jeff, away. Away, away, away.
What about us? I'm moving away your staying here.
Oh, no, no, no.
Wait, no, I... Look, Sooze, I figured something out.
Yeah, I crash there.
So you think I should?
Great.
Well, I helped start it, but, you know, uh...
So, um, Pony, where are you staying? Are you staying at your mother's house?
So who are you?
Well, if we're, like, the man invisible, what are you?
Yeah, well, that's what I do too.
No, you know what? It's not you, man. It's not anybody. It's me. Whoo! Hey.
Camel jockey.
I hope you're happy!
This has nothing to do with me, this, uh, drinking, yeah.
No, no, she went up by herself. This was not my responsibility.
Hey!
Is that your driver?
No, no, it isn't. It's cool.
Yeah?
Oh they'd never let me do what I want.
Would I get paid?
Jesus, Jeff.
If...
Yeah, I know what you're saying.
Well, uh, there's this benefit for Rwanda we're gonna do. And, uh, you know, my songs, uh, where I get the ideas for them, uh, you know, stuff like that.
Oh, How'd she get back?
What are you? Her pimp? She said she might go get a drink first.
Yeah.
I don't, I don't remember. What do I owe you?
Yeah. Yeah. How's the air force, Tim?
Yes, that's right. You know what, honey? You should go to New York. You should go. Go show 'em. They need your unique point of view.
Seriously? It's a great idea.
Hey, Tim, you know what? You win.
It was the nicest thin I've done in a long time.
Wait!  Did you say you are pregnant or you were pregnant... You had it, threw it out and you're gonna go back and dance all night!
NO-GAH-BUH- NO!  Rule number two - NO NAMES!  NO GODDAMN NAMES, you retard!
Ahh!  Baby's got two heads!!!
Thanks, Cleo.  See you tomorrow.
You sure?
No.
WHAT?!  That's insane!!!  Why would I go to the police?
Trix...
That was gas, Sweetie.
Shut up.
Kansas!
It's all my fault.  I'm sorry I ever started this...
Ammo?
Or, I could get my own horse...
Then I'll throw a few more treats on the plate.  Where's my smokes?
Oh please, we've all got bright futures ahead of us - we're not going to tell anyone.  Promise!
Well, shit-fire, Kansas, that's the sweetest goddamn thing ever...
I hate to think where that puts me.  I could be her father.
We're ready with the shot, Mr. deMille.
Where have you been keeping that gorgeous face of yours?
This is Miss Kramer.
Perhaps the reason I hated Bases Loaded is that I knew your name. I'd always heard you had some talent.
Why, you sweet kid.
The flashback in the courtroom, when she tells about being a school teacher.
You'll be waiting for me?
Is that so? What's the wonderful news?
Sorry if I crossed you up.
What about all those ideas you had?
Psychopaths sell like hotcakes.
Check.
Oh, you --
What were you -- a child actress?
I was born just two blocks from this studio.  Right on Lemon Grove Avenue.  Father was head elec- trician here till he died.  Mother still works in Wardrobe.
Should be.  It cost three hundred dollars.
Come clean, Betty.  At night you weep for those lost closeups, those gala openings...
May I say you smell real special.
It must be my new shampoo.
Why not?
What happened?
I'm trying to tell you.  This is an enormous place.  Eight master bedrooms.  A sunken tub in every bathroom.  There's a bowling alley in the cellar.  It's lonely here, so she got herself a companion. A very simple set-up: An older woman who is well-to-do.  A younger man who is not doing too well ... Can you figure it out yourself?
Come on where? Back to a one-room apartment that I can't pay for? Back to a story that may sell and very possibly will not?
If you love me, Joe.
Norma, I want to apologize for not calling you.
You'd better.  I'm very angry.
What assistant?
Gordon Cole?
It's got a lot of good things.  Of course, it would be an expensive picture...
I wouldn't know.
It is not.  Get out.
I'm sorry, and I'm sorry you lost your friend, and I don't think red is the right color.
I am big.  It's the pictures that got small.
Don't get sore at me.  I'm not an executive.  I'm just a writer.
Only asking.  I did't know you were planning a comeback.
Well?
Who?  I'd have to have somebody I can trust.  When were you born -- I mean, what sign of the zodiac?
What month?
Sagittarius.  I like Sagittarians. You can trust them.
Maybe I'd better take the rest of the script home and read it -
There sure is.
Thanks for the invitation, but I have my own apartment.
You proud boy, why didn't you tell me you were having difficulties.
Just a scene I cut out.
What's wrong with It?
Is it funny that I'm in love with you?
Have one of mine.
I've lost half a pound since Tuesday.
Good.
Why do you say that?
The rest of the jewelry is in the top drawer.
See, you didn't believe me!.. Now I suppose you don't think I have the courage!
He was trying to spare your feelings. The studio wanted to rent your car.
I'm the greatest star of them all.
You are not dressed properly.
Thanks.  Say, she's quite a character, that Norma Desmond.
Why are you so upset?  Is there anything missing?
Whose room was this?
What doctor?
I wouldn't look too closely at the postmarks.
You send them.  Is that it, Max?
Why don't you? I'm writing a script and I'm dying to finish it, no matter what.
It's just that I'm very worried about Madame.
You made her a star?
We've come for the car.
All right, Gillis.  You've got five minutes.  What's your story about?
It's about a ball player, a rookie shortstop that's batting 347.  The poor kid was once mixed up in a hold- up.  But he's trying to go straight -- except there's a bunch of gamblers who won't let him.
Got a title?
Haven't got a thing.
Look, Mr. Sheldrake, could you let me have three hundred bucks yourself, as a personal loan?
No?
Paramount studios.
This is the staircase of the palace.
I'm an artist, Alura. My work comes first. Other people come second.
What is it?
What does it mean?
Is he your entertainment for tonight?
At last. Ultimate Power.
Western Europe.
I'm sorry, but I already promised Bianca she could have Switzerland. You know how she loves to ski.
Don't leave me.
That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because she knows I love you.
You love me?
Like it?
No. Argo City. It was on a chunk of rock that was part of Krypton once---but we moved it to inner space.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
Great! I'II build a house-- right over there, with a veranda looking out to sea. And I'll plant a garden! Papayas, pineapples, bananas, mangoes--- anything'll grow here. And I'II fish in the lagoon, and we can go sailing in a dugout canoe, and---
Hello. Are you still mad at me?
It seemed that way to me.
I know I was acting funny---I'm sorry. It's just...I miss it.
I don't see why not.
That's the Power Source that was lost from Argo City! That's what I came: to find! Where does she live?
You've had your fun, Selena, the game is over.
I have a lot of repeat business. People seem to like my service.
I bet they do.
And you think you're in love.
Nurse! Nurse!
Do you have any theories about last night?
Jimmy, would you please put those poor flowers in water before they die?
I had to dump the papers in a trashcan. The Danvers have been arrested!
What's a tree?
Didn't you study six-dimensional geometry in school?
No thanks. You go on.
Linda babes! There's this all-night party at Eddie's... his folks are away...
Listen, I know I've been saying you ought party more, but keep your hands off this one, will yak? He's private property. I've been waiting years for him to develop.
Thank you both so much. It was a lovely lunch, Mrs. Danvers. I had a wonderful time. And you're a terrific chess player MR. Danvers.
Cheer up, Nigel. It's not the end of the world.
Bianca's taught me all! need to know. I'll be safe, as long as I don't go too far.
You're wasting your breath.
...trust the wisdom of the ancients, trust the Great Mother to protect us... Why. are you staring at me like that?
Nothing's wrong with my skin.
I am Selena. Give him to me. Now. Or you'll both be sorry.
I'm free. I can never thank you enough.
Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself?
Others?
It's lovely. . .
That horrible woman!
Zaltar, please help me.
You can use the wand.
Zaltar. Use the wand!
Yeah? What do you want?
Mr. Roebush?
Tuesday.
Lana Lang. How great to see you.
You know what's the problem?
Who?
But all he had was chocolate milk.
No, I mean Ricky. He's not interested in any of this stuff.
Uh-huh.
Gee, I always loved porch swings.
Mr. Kent! Superman was here!
But my Uncle Al, on my father's side, he won't eat her stuffing, he says it should be cooked on the outside of the turkey and she puts the stuffing inside the turkey. So my mother told my Aunt Ellen . . . Aunt Ellen's my father's half-sister, I told you that, right?
Wow, what a beautiful sunrise!
Name?
What kind?
Thirty-five.
First paycheck?
That's so you're still getting some money when you hit 65.
What'm I gonna do with half a cent? Buy me a thoroughbred cockroach?  Everybody loses them fractions?
No, not really. They can't be bothered collecting half a cent from your paycheck anymore than you could.
The boss wants to see you.
Please, Mr. Webster, you're a great humanitarian. Ain't you heard what it's like in them jails? You send an innocent boy in and he gets thrown in with killers and robbers and rapers and raper killer and robber rapers and...
Or socks.
Gus, do you know what I want now? I want coffee!
Hey, boss.
It ain't. It's nowhere. It blew up. That's how come they shipped the dude to Earth when he was a baby.  well. I know some stuff too, y'all.
KRYPTONITE!
I should think a taste of freedom is enough, don't you? Or would you prefer jail?
A waste-basket? GUS Those are plans.  Blueprints.
For what?
We've already got some.
Anything.
Remember, Gus. A machine doesn't want anything except to keep on being a machine. You've got to make sure it can figure out how to beat any opponent.
You want to mess with Superman?
I ain't about to argue with you.  What's gonna happen to them three? Ross the boss and those ladies?
That's up to the judge, Gus. It's not your problem anymore.
Hey listen, I didn't know your mama was comin' by...
There's no rush.
Listen, are you sure you shouldn't do something about the bridge?
I'll do more than tell you. I'll show you, back at my place. If you'll just do me one little favor first.
53.
How'm I supposed to turn this thing?
It could make weather!
Someplace where nobody knows him so they can't connect him with us.
You mean...you mean...Vera! Vera! The magnitude of this!!!
Lois, I usually do.
Haven't you heard? There's an energy crisis.  No, this was good enough for my mother --
Lois, you're amazing.
I was getting hot dogs. What do you mean?
I mean it strikes me funny that every time Superman comes around, you disappear.
Who ????
You've been under a lot of pressure lately -
Uh-uh.  Listen, I'll tell you what. You say I'm wrong. And I say I'm right. So why don't we make a little bet on it?
Hi.
"They?"
Everybody. Everybody else. I'd be buying my little rainbow at the their expense. All the ones who say "Help. Come quick. Now" I know who you'd have to pick.
Uh...home...
Does Lois know about this yet?
No offense, Kent. You're good, but Lois is the best we've got.
I like trees.
Genius!  --  Lex.
I'll be alright.
What'd he say before? He saw a girl?
Yes, but it's not all I feel.
The three proved - after exhaustive efforts - incapable of rehabilitation. Now as you know, we had no death penalty -
The one danger we have considered is that the Phantom Zone might - we cannot predict - just might be cracked by a nuclear explosion in space. I cannot say I am glad you asked me that -
To ski?
It must be tough, having to be Clark Kent.
Wait! Don't go in! It's a trap!
Too late, Luthor. Too late . . .
Where is his home, Lex Luthor? Which way?
Um. . . .we have made this guarantee.
Free!
What shall we do now?
Did you really believe we would give up our advantage?
It must have been a super effort to get out of bed, Clark.
And what do we get out of it?
Clark Kent! You socialized with him . . . a . . . reporter!
But he's never there.
He was getting on . . . and then this man with luggage and . . .  oh, it's a long story.
You're spookin' me out, Uncle Lex.
Hey! Just remember I made you.
Of course! That's his one vulnerability. The one way he can be stopped.
This wasn't in the plan.
What do you fear?
If you have any social skills, you've learned them from a rattlesnake. Just what are you up to?
Your time in prison has twisted you into a delusionary state, Luthor.
Which explains why you sent his organic matter to the sun.
Ahhhh, my favorite part of the day. Who else could have thought of this aquarium?
You're a great architect, Albert.
Thank you.
Are there any more at home like you?
Stop him, Clark!
What now, my love?
It's not what you think. Darn it. I'm going out on a story. The Secretary of Defense is landing at the airport tonight and this kid's going to be there to make sure he answers a few questions he'd rather duck.
You were probably so scared you didn't look to see what the trick was.
It wasn't a trick!
Sure, and let the plane crash in the middle of the city.
This??
You think he's for real?
See?
La de da da...
I don't like to talk about it, Lex.
Hit you? A clever girl like you?  'He turned slowly, slowly in the lava...' was how you described it. Now that's clever.  I have to hand it to you.
A night on the town instead of under it?
an Ode to Spring. are there one or two "T's" in bloodletting?
The good lord works in mysterious ways.
Lois, take Kent there and introduce him around
Superman???
Right on the first guess.
I think you'll be able to remember it. I doubt you'll misquote me.
Okay. Let's start with these strange powers of yours.
Oh.
It's not bad.
Can you really see through anything?
Can you actually fly faster than the speed of sound?
What's the matter, Otis?
I'll never forget you for that, Mr. Luthor.
It wouldn't hurt. You can't go on living in fantasies. Did you really think you could get hold of a nuclear bomb? And drop it?  Why, our Strategic Defense boys would have  --
The XK 101. Luthor, that operates on radio waves. And with our fail-safe system, only the President himself can push that button.
Well, it's very impressive but you built this junk for nothing.
How are you?
I'm just fine, Ally.  What about you?
Well, it was nice meeting you again, Mr. Stephens.
My name is...
Why?
I don't know.
Billy, please.  The children.
Well, it being so depressing and all.  But it's reality.  You can't just turn this off because you happen to think it's a bad idea.
I've tried to stay out of it.  But it turns out that's not so easy, Sam.  You've gone and got yourself this lawyer.  Mitchell Stephens. You and Risa and Wendell and the Ottos.
That's wrong, Sam.  You know that. We'll be tangled up in this thing for the next five years.  This is never going to go away...
Why?  You got money from Dolores' insurance with the school board.  We all did.
Nicole's coming over to look after the kids tonight.  She'll be there around six.
Is it true that you gave Nicole one of Lydia's dresses?  That she was wearing it when the bus crashed?
I mean, the way they look.  Their hair and clothing...
Excuse me?
What do you think?
I didn't say that.
We've only got honey.
It's interesting.
Is this mine?
It's like a song.
Nicole?
Should I keep reading?
It would be strange if you didn't feel that way.
There's no such thing as an accident, Nicole.  Not in a situation like this.
I have no questions.
What about Doreen?
Yes.
What do they do?
Crafts.
Why can't you talk to me?
Yes.
Tell me your news, Zoe.
You can't ask me that!  Not anymore! You asked me what I wanted.  Not what I wanted it for.  I want money.
I'm sorry about that, Mr. Stephens. Would you like to try the fish?
Yes.
You've been retained?
Who did they get for that?
Dolores?
Any criminal record?
No.  I was alone.  My sister Jenny was sick and stayed home that day.
Was there anything unusual about the driver, Dolores Driscoll, or the bus that particular morning?
Yes.
And where did you sit that morning?
I was scared.
That was great.
You're going to blow everyone away.
Of course.
How do you like it, Nicole?
Great.
Yeah, well, they probably smoke weed.
But of course...
Boys, this gets nobody nowhere - you're over excited, Steve and -
I want to speak to Miss Hunsecker, please.
You told him that?
That's a nice tour.  All booked?  When was Susie around here last?
Call him up and ask - he might drop dead with shock.
Blessings on thee, the both...well... Gotta run now.  See you two kids later!
I don't take kindly to you and Falco selling me ethics.  Who's the injured party here, you?
Susie, as always, is free to say anything she thinks.  Go on, dear, say exactly what's on your mind, dear.
Yeah.  At Bellevue.  Still hanging on.  But they still don't know if she was pushed.
Yeah, I got eyes.  I put things together.
I know Manny Davis.
Frankly, J.J., I don't think you got the cards to blitz me.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think so...
Not "we", Sidney, you!
I'll do it, J.J. - don't get me wrong - in for a penny, in for a pound.  I'll see it through, but stop beating me around the head. Let me make a living!
Well, what have I got?  Alimony to a pair of tramps?  They're of no concern to me.  It's you who count, but don't get me wrong - I don't intend to let you break your neck again!
J.J., you said you want to help me - prove it!
Can't hurt...
What's this boy got that Susie likes?
I was trying to build her up, not tear her down -
It's nice, Sidney, that you give me this tip...
He goes out with girls.
Well, I'll be darned.  And what does J.J. think he SHOULD do?
Could this be that boy?
Don't you ever get messages, Eyelashes?  I called you twice.
What sort of thing?
Next time I'll call in a guy to paint silver stars on the ceiling!
No, an arm, he said.  I told him you were sure the item would be in Mr. Hunsecker's column in tomorrow's...
Take a top coat.
I put a lotta trust in you, Chickie...
Why not you?
It is a favor, isn't it?
If there's a funnier man in the world than Herbie Temple at the Palace...uh...pardon us for not catching the name, we were too busy laughing.  No, make that 'screaming'.  It's sweet of you, J.J., thanks. Probably see you at Twenty One tonight.  No, for supper, late. Right. 'Bye...
And it would cost a pretty penny, huh?
Yeah!  Like me!  I don't choke on my own gall - I fight back!  Let THEM choke, not me!
This is big, you know.  Very big! Let's go out later, drink some firewater.  With the boys.  Fred can call Millie and -
No one's ever stood up to my brother the way you did.
But, please, Steve, please - one step at a time!  I was born only yesterday!...
Not what you're doing now.  At least don't ask me - don't ask him. You're fighting for your life! What do YOU want to do?
... but the output went to shit after three seconds.  I'm thinking now it's the way I'm matrixing the command hierarchies...
No good.
Yes.  Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.
I'm a cybernetic organism.  Living tissue over a metal endoskeleton.
Not like me.  A T-1000.  Advanced prototype. A mimetic polyalloy.
TERMINATED!?  Shit!  Why didn't you tell me? We gotta right now!
Does it hurt?
How long do you live?  I mean, last?
That's great!  See, you're getting it.
We're not gonna make it, are we?  People, I mean.
Pain causes it?
The T-1000 has the same files that I do.  It could anticipate this move and reacquire you at Dyson's house.
I know.  This is a dream, Sarah.
So what do you think, Doctor?  I've shown a lot of improvement, haven't I?
You look like handmade shit.
Why attack Russia?
The CPU from the first terminator.
And no elbows on the table!
Don't see me to my door, there's no need.
David. David Wills. I'm your liaison officer with the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs Committee. Sir.
Sounds a lot of run.  So they sent the big guns to check up on me. We recruiting children now?
I guess you admire musicians.
I guess it's possible.
Your manner.
I was in Vienna. I had with me an Austrian chauffeur, Max his name was, he spent time in the camps. We were looking at these Viennese cleaning up the bomb damage, scavenging for rotting food, butt ends, anything. I said, 'To think a million of these people came out to welcome Adolf on the day he entered the city, a million of 'em, and now look at 'em.'  And Max said, 'Oh, not these people, Major. These people were all at home hiding Jews in their attics.' You get the point, Colonel? The point is they're all full of shit.
Don't talk about things you know nothing about. He was in a dictatorship!
Steve.
Think you can get me any of that?
Oh yes, Major, I have recordings of all his symphonies. I kept them safe during the bombing. My favourite is the Seventh Symphony.
I want you to understand why you're here. You're automatically banned from public life under Control Council Directive No 24. We're here to look into your case before you appear in front of the Tribunal for Artists of the Denazification Commission. You understand that?
Could you tell us about being made a Prussian Privy Councillor. How did that happen to a non-Party member?
I may have, as... as I said, I simply don't remember.
Sure.
When will my case be heard by the Tribunal?
Who?
Gee, that's a thing of beauty, honest to God, a real thing of beauty. I'm going to try to remember that. Liberty, humanity and justice. Beautiful. But you used the word 'naive'. Are you now saying you think you were wrong? That art and politics can't be separated?
I believe art and politics should be separate, but that they weren't kept separate I learned to my cost.
What telegram?
'Happy birthday, dear Adolf, love Wilhelm.' Or words to that effect. That sounds to me like you were dropping on your knees and saying, 'Okay, Adolf, you win. You're the number one man. Have a swell party.'
No!
You sure you didn't call one of your close buddies and say, God in heaven, did you see what that guy von der Null wrote about me? The greatest conductor on earth. I want him out the way. He had the nerve to accuse me I am not playing enough modern music. Send him to Stalingrad. Isn't that what you did? You don't like criticism, do you, Wilhelm?  You surely didn't like them saying there was another conductor who was better than you... Are you saying the name von der Null was never mentioned in your talks with Goebbels?
You've really no idea? I'll tell you what happened. He died in Stalingrad.
Those attitudes do not exist in me.
Do you know what that is?
Okay, so what is it?
How can I know such a thing?
Oh, we didn't play for his birthday, we played the evening before - it was the 19th of April not the 20th.
That's what I asked.
Guess what I am holding in my hand. You like guessing games?
It's Dr. FurtwÃ¤ngler's baton, which I stole.
I can give you freedom of movement, freedom to work, freedom, Helmuth. But I need something in return.
He did?
Edwin von der Null. Music critic. He gave FurtwÃ¤ngler terrible reviews while he raved about Herbert von Karajan.
Goebbels, yes, Josef Goebbels said, 'There's not a single filthy Jew left in Germany on whose behalf Dr. FurtwÃ¤ngler has not intervened.' No, no one could have been less of a Nazi than Dr. FurtwÃ¤ngler.
But this was the same guy who conducted for Adolf on his birthday.
You ever seen Adolf Hitler's eyes when he was making a speech? I've seen 'em on films.
I don't know what you mean, Major.
They said I was dogged?
A phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range...
You can't to that...
I had him hooked.  He was just about to ask me out. I could tell.
That guy's a jerk.  I did you a favor.
Yes.  Don't hurt me.
Hey, I'm not stupid, y'know. They can't build anything like that yet.
And you're from the future too?
You trust him.  He's got that strength.  You'd die in a second for John.
Okay.  Talk some more.
About what?
Well, we're gonna uninvent the bastard.  Eighty-six it.  We'll blow up the place...burn it down.  Something.
That's not my mission.
I was thinking, there's so much I've got to show you when we get through this. It's mind boggling, the pos- sibilities...Disneyland, the beach, movies...matinees with popcorn and foot-long hot dogs...
Hot dogs?
My whole life has been combat.
Probably.  Sarah, if I get zeroed...
It'll never be over, will it? Look at me, I'm shaking. Some legend, huh?  You must be pretty disappointed.
Why were the other two women killed?
You've heard enough.  Decide. Are you going to release me?
Here's her driver's license.
You gotta be kidding me.  The new guys'll be short-stroking it over this one.  A one-day pattern killer.
I already did.  No answer at the door and the apartment manager's out.  I'm keeping them there.
It is so very inappropriate for you to mention my father.  Or, did you think this, between us, was friendship?  Just because you went fishing with my father, I should sit on my hands while you throw my money away?
I, uh... haven't been to Sunday school in years...
I'm so sorry.
Oh, God... !
This can't be real...
"... wait for help."  Wait for help. I'm not opening a door that specifically warns me not to.
I'll give you a boost.
That's classic.
Give me an address so I can send your shirt back.
What are you doing here?
I'm tired.  I'm sorry, I should go. I've been enough of a nuisance.
What's wrong?
I could've handed you to them.  They find me now, I'm dead...
Get out of my car!
Who is it?
What are you <u>doing</u> here?
Nicholas...
How deluded can you be?  There's no <u>why</u>...
Don't move, you bitch... !
Hi.  Didn't get a chance to say goodbye.
That's my fault.  I get too worked up at these.  I'm very method.  You do know... that's not my name.
I realize.  Maybe you could... tell me a little about yourself.
Divorced.  Remarried to some pediatrician or gynecologist, or pediatric gynaecologist, in Sausalito.
Fun?
This isn't an escort service?
Like a stroke?
Do it for YOU.
Okay, okay... okay?  I just... you know I hate surprises.
C.R.S.  Who do you think?  Jesus H., thank your lucky charms.  To think what I almost got you into.
You dodged a bullet.
Everything.  I'm a goddamn human-pinata...
Well, where to begin.  It's complicated...
I know, look at me, well...  What happened?  I don't know.  I don't even really know.  I have some things to try to take care of... I need the car a little while.
V-A-N... O-R-T-O-N...  A gift from Conrad Van Orton. Interesting...
And if nothing's lacking?
May I make two suggestions... ?
Get rid of them.
Show Mr. Van Orton to his room.
Dinner's in the oven.
Look, where is he?!
No.
Your ex-wife.
"Under the Bleachers"... by Seymour Butts.
Pardon me?  I'm afraid I don't...
Hey... !
Anything wrong... ?
What's happened...
Uh... Nell Vance...
And what kind of sleeper?
I gave my key to the gate to Todd, but the Dudleys'll be here in the morning.
You don't really believe it's haunted... Do you believe in ghosts?
Nell --
Was sure she'd be in here.
Nell!
Malcolm, this is essential work I'm doing.  Just think what my research can do for education. Elementary school classrooms near train tracks or airports, where loud noise is random; this helps to prove the need for sound insulation if the children are ever going to learn to read.
I, I just can't...
Sorry.
In the bathroom in my mother's room, the toilet was next to an old wooden table.  It smelled like that wood.
I wasn't thinking about my mother's bathroom.
Why?
Have either of you seen David Watts?
What do you want?
Me?  No.  What are you doing here?
Why'd she kill herself?
She was unhappy.
I've seen 'em.  Lot to dust.
No.
A blank canvas!  I could paint your portrait, directly on you. Or maybe not.  So, you?  Husbands? Boyfriends?  Girlfriends?  Where do you live?
Why?
My place isn't like yours, Nell, it doesn't have a view of sea.  It doesn't have a view of anything. What's interesting about the way I live is what goes on inside the walls.  Living with me... My boundaries aren't very well defined, Nell.  Do you know what I mean?
I think so.
Is there anything in the world that you want or need?
Well, you're certainly not a person.
No.  You're not specific enough to be a person.  You're more like a vibe.
It's not a compliment.
Who?
We all did.
Where do we go?
See, a successful man like me has limitations -- I lose touch at a street level.  So I have to depend on a smart boy like you who's closer to the nitty and the gritty than I am.
There's been some trouble downtown.
Our black friends?
We'll find him.
CQ what?
I didn't expect anyone.
No, not my girl.  Self-control, she had. Point of pride.  And people don't change, do they.
What, tryin' to catch him with another bird?
You should talk to Elaine.  That was her best friend.
It's only insurance.  Can't be too careful.  This Terry Valentine, he's probably a wonderful fella.  They were together how long?
He came in with Jenny to the restaurant where I work.  That's not where they met.
Gate's open.  I had a butcher's at the house.
Butcher's hook.  Look.  I don't much reckon those minders of his.
I've been wondering something.
What d'you say, Elaine?
Last time I saw you, weren't you up for some equity-waiver thing?
Probably.
Why did you come here?
Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?
How d'you mean?
I was skint -- didn't have no money to get here.
Now who's being sarcastic?
That's what was estimated.
Lives high off the hog and waits for the next big thing.  Like me -- but on a grander scale of failure.
You don't believe it was a car accident.
Jenny was supposed to come to my place that night.  She called me, asked if she could come over.  She and Terry had been -- having some trouble.  Lately.  I don't know about what.  On this occasion, it reached some sort of crisis point.
She told you all about my details but not about his.  Lovely.
I'll tell ya something:  it made me a model prisoner.  Put me right off any escape attempts.  Tunnel my way to freedom after that experience?  Not bloody likely.
Did you.  What was that in aid of?
I've got the hang of the driving.  Found this place all right.
Minor officials bother you, don't they?
You're just on a higher plane, Wilson.
Eh?
Deals?  My client is involved in any number of deals at any given moment. You'd have to be more specific.
Yeah, that's right.
You'll be looking forward to getting back, then.
But you stuck it out, anyway, all that time.
I had to, didn't I.  Nothing else for it. Then just when I'd finished my nine years -- my contract -- wallop, I had to bugger off to the States.
Good luck.
Kinda makes you wonder why more people don't put a bullet through their fuckin' skulls, doesn't it.
What d'you mean, any happier?
You do?
How we gonna get that lucky?
Walked.
Where's ... what's-his-name -- Fred --
Who's looking for you?
Great bloke.  Really turned things around there.  180 degrees.
...I'm so sorry about your loss.
Oh, I know. Don't worry, Ed. I came to tell you...
Yes?
Yeah.
You've got talent, anyone could see that. And he's the best. If he thinks a student has talent, he'll take 'em on for next to nothing. You're a cinch to be accepted, I could cover the cost of the lessons, like I said, it's pretty modest--
You're an enthusiast.
...I guess I've been all wet.
...I wanted to make you happy.
...No, please.
...Mm.
Mistake, no, it says E-flat, she plays E-flat. Ping-ping. Hit the right note, always. Very proper.
Uh--
It's called dry cleaning. You heard me right, brother, 'dry cleaning'-- wash without water, no suds, no tumble, no stress on the clothes. It's all done with chemicals, friend, and your garments end up crisp and fresh. And here's the capper: no shrinkage.
Fifty-fifty, straight down the line. You and me. Finance and expertise. So--you've got the dough then, do ya?
...Was that a pass?
Yeah.
...Yeah, that's it. As per our discussion.
Well, there it is. Writ large in legal escriture, next step is--
And I've never been asked--Look, you want the dough back? You know who I am! You--
How much to they want, Dave?
The sonofabitch. The blackmailer. It's, uh, it's no one you know. It's a businessman from Sacramento. A goddamn pansy, Ed. He tried to rope me into some crackpot scheme; I heard him out and then told him to go to hell. And the very next day, the very next day, Ed, I get blackmailed for the same amount.
...Dave?
...What a knucklehead.
...What's so damn strange about that?
...I don't know what happened to Big Dave. I know some of it. Irregularities in my books, they said. Can I explain it.
I knew about it. Big Dave told me about it, and the spot he was putting himself in by getting the money.
...You've gotta give me something to work with. Freddy Riedenschneider is good, but he's not a magician. He can't just wave his little wand in the air and make a plausible defense materialize. Look. Look at what the other side is gonna run at us. They got the company books, prepared by you--*cooked* by you--that's Motive. They got a murder scene *you* had access to. That's Opportunity. They got that little trimmer thing he was stabbed in the throat with--a *dame's* weapon--
...I don't get it.
Look, chum, this is a guy, from what I understand, told everybody he was a war hero, right? Island hopping, practically liberated the Pacific all by himself with a knife in one hand and a gun in the other and twenty yards of Jap guts between his teeth.
Yeah.
...who among us is in a position to say...
Sure you don't need one?
I'm fine.
Yeah.
Yeah.
...You sure, Eddie?
...I'm gonna take his hair and throw it out in the dirt.
What the--
They're just people like you and me, Ed. Remember that.
OK, boys, which of you gets the privilege?
Yes, sir.
...Look, pal, it's a tough break, but, uh... well damnit, your wife's been pinched.
Sweet Jesus!
What's the combination?
In every exhibition room.  The museum's divided into five cells. The reception and exhibit are in cell five.  We could arm the motion detectors in cells one to four, then seal the perimeter with our fire doors.
In this violent world, I believe the only way to stay sane is to take time to notice beautiful things.
I don't like animals.  Never have. Dog bit me when I was little.  After that I gave up on pets.  Animals are irrational.  Give me a psychotic killer any day.  If there's one thing that makes me queasy it's being part of a food chain.  My first case as a rookie, two brothers climbed a fence at the zoo.  It was late August.  Over ninety.  The polar bear was inside his cave.  Kids didn't know he was in there.  All they saw was the pool. They got to swimming and splashing. The noise woke up the bear.  By the time I arrived, both little boys were in pieces.  The bear was dragging one kid around by the foot. I can still hear the mother screaming --
I think I should come with you.
This place is a maze.
Got my hands full here.
Dr. John Whittlesley.
Dear God.  Where are we, Lieutenant?
Now Margo, don't overreact.  Cuthbert has to cut costs somehow.  My leaving makes perfect sense.  This isn't exactly early retirement.  I've overstayed the party a bit.
Your work is highly relevant.  What about your display on Primitive Pharmacology?  Cuthbert told me himself he was going to feature it prominently in the Superstition Exhibit.
Come on, Margo.  We're on the verge of something huge.  Let's consider the possibility, just the three of us, alone in this room.  What if John was right.  I mean, what if?  And he sent back an egg of his monster in the crates.  When it got to the museum, it hatched.
We can't.  We've managed to get inside the one place that's safe.  I think we should sit tight and wait for reinforcements.  If we go outside, we're risking more lives. You have to accept it, Margo, there's nothing we can do.  The building must be swarming with police by now.  It won't take long for them to get through the doors.
Something tried to get into this room!
It's from John.  Those two arrows were his insignia.  It's addressed to Louis Moriarty, a patron who financed his expeditions.
Margo, this is too dangerous.  You always think you can solve everything.  This time you don't have enough information.  The animal might behave in unexpected ways.  Leave her here with me.  Don't put her in danger.
Lizard DNA and human DNA on the same strand?  Impossible.  The sample must be contaminated.
Eats them?
How about lunch?
Something came up in autopsy tonight.  Imbedded in Beauregard's body we found a claw.
I didn't imagine it.  I know what I saw.  Are you sure there are enough men in there?
You're not.  Where is it?
That was D'Agosta.
What happened?
It didn't want the fibers.  What does that mean?
I think... it means it's full.
No.  It's still hunting, but not for the hormones.
We have to try and draw it off!
Help someone!
He has to look here or I won't get a clear shot.  Call him, Margo.
I want to book a flight to Fiji.
Viti Levu.  For how many?
When do you want to leave, remembering, of course, you do lose a day on the way there?
Why wouldn't I?
Give me a shot from Truman's ring.
Thank you.
But how do you account for the popularity of those eight hours a day when Truman sleeps?
<i>A show.</i>  Then who am I?
The memory of who?
You think she'd go through with it?
Sure she would.
Yeah, what happened?
Who?
When you were hauling chickens for Kaiser Poultry, what was the furthest you ever went off the island?
Yeah...
--I figure we could scrape together eight thousand.
Every time you and Marlon--
--We could bum around the world for a year on that.
I won't be here Sunday.
That's right.  I do, don't I?
So why do you want to go?
Let me out, Truman.  You're not right in the head.  You want to destroy yourself, you do it on your own!
You know surprises aren't good for me. You should really call before you come over, dear.
It was Dad, I swear, dressed like a homeless man.  And you know what else was really strange?  A businessman and a woman with a little dog appeared from nowhere and forced him onto a bus.
It looks so small.
See you tomorrow, Truman.
I think you better tell us.
We don't even know you.
What am I doing here?
You've been back to Dallas?
I hope to. We're working to develop this evidence --
What's that?
You follow me out here for a reason?
I'm a doctor, but I think I mentioned that. OB-GYN.
What is it? Kiddie porn again? Sexual battery of a patient? I've had my license taken away in three states.
How?
I picked up the historical document of the venality and hypocrisy of the American government. The daily newspaper.
You said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Why?
When we were young men in the military, your father and I were recruited for a project. They told us it was biological warfare. A virus. There were rumors about its origins.
What killed those men?
I'm on the roof.
Did you find something?
Panic? Have you ever seen me panic, Scully?
Whatever you told them in there, you don't have to protect me.
Mulder -- what are you doing?
This is one of the firemen who died in Dallas?
You knew this man didn't die at the bomb site before we got here.
I can't really talk right now.
I don't know.
This looks like new grass to you?
And where are they going with it?
What are my choices?
-- of what exactly?!
Very weird.
I hear the humming. Like electricity. High voltage maybe.
Why was I assigned to you? To debunk your work. To reign you in. To shut you down.
Scully --
That area is currently off limits to anyone other than authorized medical personnel.
I breached protocol. I broke contact with the S.A.C. I ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device.
That's why you bombed the building. The infected firemen, the boy --
Find Agent Scully. Save her. Only her science can save the future.
Our vaccine may have no effect!
You can't kill Mulder. He's got too much light on him.
I'd be there for him.
Yes mother.
Nothing.
The first... What?  Six or seven times I went in.   Remember what happened?
Like a New Year's Day hangover.
Sometimes... Once they've been caught they feel a need for disclosure.  They have so much they want to tell. But they've never had a sympathetic ear. They need someone to understand why.  Stargher used to hide the bodies very carefully.  It was part of the ritual. Some weren't found for weeks and any physical evidence had been meticulously wiped clean.  But these last three... They were still in water - always in water - but  Listen, he wasn't just careless.  It went beyond that...
I still don't understand why I can't do this... This isn't some "troubled kid" you're dealing with.
Do you think that's funny?
Just like we all have fantasies, right? Things only we know, that we don't share.
Why'd you bring him here?
Don't you feel there are different sides to every personality?  Maybe even the worst of us is capable of one decent act.  We're all human.
Yep.  Eloped.
They're hungry.
You liked him?
She the one from Santa Cruz?
Not a gift.  A highly evolved area in her cerebral cortex, that's all.  A genetic fluke.
I hate to admit it, but there's something perversely satisfying about this.
She changed the codes.
When did he lapse into the coma?
What about narcotics?
Dr. Kent.
You're looking well.
Thanks you.  Six weeks off does a body good.  I heard she got the approval to try the reversal with Edward.
That's a secret.
What about the cat?
Someone looking after her little girl?
So?
We'll go back to his house, Pete. There's still a lot to do.  Analyze the videos, track sales of the bleach, go through his records.  Maybe he owns property somewhere.
Sit down.
Well, I saw you at the funeral.
Don't understand what Harry saw in a fellow like that.
Anything really wrong with your papers?
Might as well I suppose. Are you busy?
I can try. Is it comedy, or tragedy?
Seemed like a good idea.
Here, it will be cold on that train.
Oh, the usual things...
They'll be returned to you, Miss Schmidt, as soon as they've been examined.
Right. Sit down Miss Schmidt, we will send your letters and things back to you.
In one of his letters he asked you to telephone - a good friend of his called Joseph. He gave you the number of the Casanova Club. That is where a lot of friends of Lime used to go.
Must you take those?
I'm afraid I've never heard of you. What's your name again?
A parrot bit me.
So would I.
How about the doorway?
Well, there's not much time.
I'll look it up for you.
Heard of Harry Lime?
What about?
Listen, Harry - I didn't believe that...
Hmm.
...exactly who did you tell about me? Hmm?
Mr. Popescu is here tonight.
Mr. Popescu - Mr. Martins.
Coming to the point, please.
Find out?
...he was. Yes, for a short time, while they carried him across the road.
Oh, you did.
That's all you meant?
He didn't want to get involved.
Okay.
Yeah; just ten or fifteen dollars maybe.
Thank you, sir. Thank you. I promise I will repay you.
Yeah, that's right. Now could you be quiet so I can get some sleep.
I don't think so.
So?
We're ok.
He said if we lent him money h would tell us about a secret beach.
Bonsoir.
And you, if you had come out of Egypt, you would have been destroyed in the desert with those who worshipped the Golden Calf.
What do you think you're doing?
Oh, please...
Fire...
How come you know all this shit?
You write that?  Come work for me. You've got a lot to learn; I can teach it to you.
Why no silencer?
"...<i>und die Worte zerfielen mir im Munde wie modrige Pilze</i>..."
Too many good players down here. I'm with one right now.
Your father??
That was a later invention, it's not in the scrolls.... Anyway, the Jews know where the sentences end. They know the whole thing by heart. Every word. Every letter.
Nazis talk about it all the time.
Is it like Eichmann? Are we goofing?
I don't know. I just want to try it.
Yeah, I remember.... Kill any Jews yet?
Really, which one? I bet it was the guy with the Prada shoes.
They used to. Today it's not an issue.
Totally. The family emigrated from Bulgaria when he was eleven.
No... Yeah, fine, go ahead... So what's this about? Is this about me?
My mother's family is French, my father's was German, originally.
The Jews are different.... Blacks are disgusting and inferior, but it's like criticizing a retarded child. The Jews are...a poison in the human well....
What's that go to do with...I've gone out with a, with Jewish women. Why?
So you're saying it's not true.
To discredit me. Because I know who they are. Look, I thought I explained it to you. Those people can say or do anything. And they will. It's all narrative to them, it's... Are you going to print what this guy said?
Did you kill Ilio Manzetti?
Who killed Manzetti?
Why did you come tonight? To see me?
To hear them read Torah.
I can't help what I think.
All right, what if all along you were actually infiltrating the Nazis -- to expose them....
I don't do that.
Don't tell me what I --
Daniel Balint.
You mean Ilio Manzetti?
How have things been going?
Then he couldn't be bitter about living alone.
Is this because of those kids who used to beat you up?
Which was his room?
Open it up.
Not too fast.
You said they didn't have night guards.
They don't. I checked twenty times.... Somebody must have talked.
The Manzetti thing must have scared her. She thinks she'll get implicated.
Take a right on 59th...  We'll put it someplace else.
If I went back to the lumberyard, the guy'd give me all the dynamite I wanted. Untraceable, you wouldn't -- need to...
When do you want it to go off?
Yeah, uh... So how are you? What's going on?
JTS...?
Who'd you kill?
Beth Shalom? It's Reform.
Yes, and they were said to be the most virulent proponents of the Final Solution. Really, who but a Jew would want to kill Ilio Manzetti simply because he was Jewish? Who thinks about such things?
Yes.
And you...?  Do you love Enzo?
Listen, I just found out we've got real problems in Sicily!
What d'you mean?
Yes!  The notary is a phony.  He has the same signature as the contractor!
I thought it was Spanish that you spoke?
You're right.  You're fired.
Yes.
Yes, of course, I'll do the Hula!
What was he like, when he was little?
... It's a comfortable place.
Sinister is what I'd call it...! Ours is so much cheerful!  Why don't you come and stay with me... There's plenty of room in my suite.
Okay, now we have a good five minutes to have a nice peaceful talk.
How did it happen?
It isn't lit yet.
The rules are the rules.
Not only is Jacques Mayol a very special friend, but he happens to be one of the best divers in the world!  And you're throwing him out!  Are you crazy, or what? Stupido!
Not at all!
Today at lunch, you asked me if I had any questions.
As I said, second of all you're too skinny.  You've got tiny lungs. I still don't understand how you can dive without getting sick.
It's not safe, they say.  The doctors say it isn't possible to go deeper and live.  Free diving is over as a sport.
... Push me back in the water...
A drink to warm up?
I recognize you.
I don't know... why?
So have I.  ... Hello?
I'm still here.
Hello?
You'll try again tomorrow?
Anything.
... Are you sure?
Why don't you ask me?
Nice... Very interesting... Great!  ... I guess.
How long can he stay down?  Without breathing?
A settlement completely demolished, ten smashed army jeeps, four dead Arabs. G dash D damn it, Hammer! You think you're above the Ten Commandments? Just find Santa Claus and bring him back to us. No heroics, got it?
You mean you want us to make copies of Yentl, Fiddler On The Roof, and Chaim Potok's The Chosen?
It was a trap. I'm back at square one.
You like my Mordechai, yes?
Want to get a drink?
What!?
Mordechai. Do you love your mother?
So don't show a picture.
I understand that. I just thought that you might want to know.
So Morde-chai, tell me, what brings your bad self down to the KLF?
Okay, look. I'm going to work really, really hard on this one. But, please stop with the pressure. I'm already tense as it is.
What are you doing?
What's your shpiel, Santa?
I shlepped all the way to the North Pole for this? I come to fight you, and you don't even put out anything to nosh on? What kind of arch nemesis are you?
What's going on? Why'd he stop?
My sonâ€”inâ€”law. What do you think of him?
I sleep it off.
I don't know.
They all say the cat killed this second girl.
Sure!
I want him to lock me up.
It's a blackcard and bad card, but not the card of the cat -â€ not the card of fourâ€”footed things.
I saw Teresa. Maybe I was the last to see her except perhaps her Mamacita and her little brother. I was going past --
They're fools. Why don't they let Charlie How-Come hunt it alone. He's an Indian.
What did they say before the bad card came up?
And if you've got cold feet honey, Ill take over for you. That red dress of yours fits just perfect on me.
Oh, Mr. Galbraith! I'm so glad you're here.
You know all about these things - - and I've lived here all my life â€- and I still don't know what the Procession means.
Oh, that's so interesting!
Yes. I want to go out and patrol the town - be everywhere at once - be sure nothing happens to anybody.
Just a minute, Robles.  Let him go on.
About Charlie's leopard?
It could be a man.
I don't know.
What do you do now?
So you see meeting you is a real thrill for me.
I'm sure if you are as talented as you are charming, Miss Walker, you have nothing to worry about.
I thought they came right past here â€”â
Yes. The lipstick.
Kiki -- he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
That's easy. Me.
You're too good to me.
Kiki - he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
On his back, I suppose.
You're too good to me.
It must be the altitude â€”â you, bucking around the countryside with a lot of bootâ€”andâ€”saddle boys --
Why do you want to stay around here? It'll only make you feel badly.
You already know the answer to that. I want this town to be safe and happy again --
Half to the Delgado family and half to Clo-Clo's family.
I know -- Teresa -â€
Will you please come with me?
That might depend on where youâ€™re going.
Perhaps it wasnâ€™t so brave of him. Had I been here I just might have given him his money, Mr Lombard. One can reap rewards from the strangest of conduct, as someone in your line of work ought to know.
Oh-oh! TouchÃ©, Mr Lombard! But tell me, what would you know about sisterly love, eh?  No. Donâ€™t. You might get confused speaking of things you donâ€™t understand and we need you clear- headed, at least until youâ€™ve done what we are paying you for.
I found this at your brotherâ€™s.
How dare you...  You donâ€™t know this tape belongs to my brother, do you, Mr Lombard?
Who is Friedman?
Just a moment...  Go ahead.
Mr Lombard. Mrs De Moraes...
Arenâ€™t you curious to know about Friedman?
Leon hung himself...
Is there anything to understand?
...Weâ€™re turning in circles.
Something like that.
Why the hell couldnâ€™t you divorce the man?
Iâ€™m sorry, sir. Could you try that again?
Youâ€™re sure you wonâ€™t sit down, Miss Stewart?
There are over 4 million people in this city - why me?
I know where to look.
Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™ll find a way.
Thank you for the guided tour, but would you mind telling me what weâ€™re doing here?
Right... Well, Iâ€™ll get your money first thing in the morning, okay?  Okay. Goodnight then.
Yeah. Goodnight, Emily.
Oh. What... Yeah. Okay.
That-that wonâ€™t do. Thatâ€™s not the way it goes. You saw it, you tell it, thatâ€™s the way...
Iâ€™m afraid the only pups currently available at such notice are brown and trained. But they are all very cheerful and have been thoroughly checked for diseases...
Where is the Austrian?
What?
Where are we?
Finsbury Park. Weâ€™re in Finsbury Park.
The company. We all work for the company.
Iâ€™m sorry but Mr Gluck is not answering, sir.  Would you like to leave a message?
No... I told you on the phone. Whoever broke in messed-up all your papers. I put everything back where I thought it ought to be.  Maybe itâ€™s there with...
What do you think has happened to your son, Mrs Spitz?
Check with your sonâ€™s bank. Banks donâ€™t usually give out information about their customers.
Then you should not have sought an explanation.
Yesterday. It all looked normal.
Why do you think your son chose not to come to you for funds for his photography, Mrs Spitz?
What happens now?
Vous Ãªtes FranÃ§ais?
I donâ€™t know what your problem is, but...
Huh. Iâ€™d have thought a tough guy like you would know better. The sick ones are out there, friend. They make up the clientÃ¨le. Get rid of them and weâ€™re out of business.
You know what, Martin? I ought to tie you down with your old arse up in the air and advertise the hole in the middle of it to the world. Free. And hope you never die.
Is this Friedman, Martin?  Come on, scumbag. Youâ€™ve reached your sell- by date. Tell me if this is Friedman, where he is in Los Angeles and what name heâ€™s using?
Hyatt... Friedmanâ€™s... at the Hyatt...
I gather weâ€™ve done business with a friend of yours?
The person who put us in touch seems to think so.
Will you be alone?  The merchandise. Is it just you or...
Can I get up now?
Iâ€™m sorry. Itâ€™s just you donâ€™t look local...
No sick people in the country, huh?... Just tell me one thing, Rhian. Leonâ€™s story about the boy? You just took his word for it?
... No.
I know his work better than I know him.
Would you know where I might reach her?
A lâ€™achat, trois ou quatre mille. En location, cinq cent. Mais Ã§a pourrait faire plus. Je ne sais pas. Câ€™est pas vraiment mon truc.  I donâ€™t know any Austrian, Xavier.
Okay, shitbag. Iâ€™m only going to ask you this once. Where is Friedman?
Figlio di puttana. Youâ€™re the French asshole who bumped off the London guys...
The acid bath?
Huh. Maybe he figured the news our London bureau got a visit from a hitman on behalf of a pissed off client wouldnâ€™t go down too well. He only shared his guilty secret last night. And then only â€˜cause he was so fucking edgy after calling his hotel we persuaded him to talk.
I can only tell you what he told us...
Youâ€™re sure he said his caller was a man?
My dear Aulon, to you it shall befall the honor of impersonating the royal blood!
My dear Aulon...  That's fine...
This I can do.  I was studying at the University of Paris -- till the English invaded it.
Yes, I am.  I'm an archer who can read and write.  Who do you want to write to?
How dare you tell me what God tells me to do!
Jeanne, you've been badly wounded...
Yes.  Yes, I'm fine...  We need more brushwood!  Why are you staring at me like that?
But I hear so many voices... one voice saying one thing, another voice saying the opposite -- love your enemy, kill your enemy -- what is good, what is evil...?
I don't know it.  I feel it.
Did your voices tell you that?  You told me you hadn't heard them for months...
Did you come back to marry me or to insult me?
... and maybe the king will give you some money, and a little land, and a title even...  ... wouldn't that be a fine thing? You, a lady of title!
I'm not afraid of the fire anymore. It will purify me...
I won't tell you more about that. I'm more afraid of displeasing Him than not answering you...
No... I said "Surrender in the name of the King of France"...
And so I... I prefer my banner.
No, of course not... I never killed anyone...
Yes, maybe... I don't remember...
Well... at the coronation of King Charles VI...
Be patient, my lord... you've seen how it is.  This girl has a way with people... but everyday we're making progress...
... and your prerogative is to find her guilty...
Scared of a girl?
Dead you're worthless, darling.
God defeated the English, not me.
Really?
The English??
You will swear to tell the truth about whatever you are asked.
You must take the oath!  Not even a king, would refuse to take an oath to tell the truth in a matter of faith.
Many things...
I ask only one thing... to hear me in confession...
Your health and happiness has always been my first concern, Charles... ever since you were a little boy -- and I think I know you better than your own mother...
What was my mission?  To help my country?  But how could I do that? I was only a poor girl who knew nothing about riding or making war... so I decided to wait and not to speak to anyone about it.
I don't need lodgings if we're to be marching on Orleans...
Well... we are, of course, enormously grateful for your past efforts, but your task is done.  Now it's time for negotiation... and after many months of skillful work, our dear Tremoille is about to seal a treaty with our Burgundian friends who will no longer lend their support to the English.  You see, my dear Jeanne... as it is written in the Bible, "to everything there is a season:  a time for war, and a time for peace"...
Peace will only be got from the English at the end of a lance!
You mustn't see her, my lord.  We know nothing about her... we don't even know if she is from Lorraine.
Your majesty, I really think you...
My captains have sworn their support.
When you saw your king for the first time, was there an angel over his head?
You told us about the appearance of this... voice.  What exactly did you see?  Part of it... or all of it?
Does he have hair?
It is all his majesty can afford. He has even donated his very own personal savings.  His majesty will greatly appreciate a gesture of good will in this delicate negotiation between our two families.
You know, I feel a great sorrow for you, because you're laughing now, but by tomorrow night some of you will be dead and having to repeat your jokes in front of God.
Stand by with the battering-rams...
Not yet.
My lord Dunois... I have wonderful news! -- finally -- he's sending her to us -- thanks be to God -- we're saved -- it's wonderful!
The Dauphin -- he's sending us food -- and supplies -- and an army -- led by Jeanne -- the maiden from Lorraine -- isn't it wonderful?!
Yes.  We can pray.
And... what does Jeanne think?
We return to Orleans... across the bridge, at the Tourelles.
You look disappointed... Isn't this what you wanted?
Jeanne... The men are exhausted!
No...
You mean it was not of your own free will that you were on the ledge?
Jesus Christ... the goddamn English will pay for this!
God knows, but it was a bad idea!
What's the use?  The drawbridge is up!
You call this... glory...?  All this... this blood... this smell of...
Jeanne... the man hasn't been paid for six months -- that's his only reward.  Let him take a few teeth...
How many did he give you?
No.
I don't know... I thought...
What are you doing out here?
Why were you yelling like that?!
"Let all who love me follow me"... Where does God get mentioned?  Come on Jeanne, be honest.  You fought for yourself, in your name.
No, I do not think so.  I don't think that killing each other will ever bring peace.
Yes I am.
But you already confessed this morning...
They weren't my shoes.  Mine were too small.
Is that bad?
I heard about your sister, and I... understand your pain...
Why are you here, Mr. Wladek?
Sit.
Let me see this.
For what? For my tie?
The Gestapo found our weapons. They've arrested Janina and Andrzej. They're bound to find out about this place, too - you must get away at once.
Calm down, what, what is it?
I haven't seen him.
Who told you?
We leave the money and the watch on the table. And we cover it like this.  In full view. The Germans will search high and low, I promise you, they'll never notice it.
Just one. Dostoevsky. The Idiot. Three zlotys.
You go to Heller, did I ask you to talk to him?
...not even music, nothing, no radios for the Poles. But I'm sure you'll find work, Wladek, a pianist like you.
What d'you think I mean, Kitten? I forgot, that's what I mean.
Pig!
Bitch!
You're a dirty pig!
Thank God - Wladek! You're wounded.
No, I don't think so?
Sorry, I don't remember.
Where are you hiding?
No, it was a table.
There is something to be said for silence
And with time she will, I'm sure, become affectionate.
Well, that is a strong opinion.
Don't answer, he low born. Jun look at him, mongrel. Your wife where she?
You'd have to organise it up here.
Yes, I thought that.
Has Ada ever spoken to you?
No, but her words are in my head.  I know what you think, that it's a trick, that I'm making it up. No, the words I heard, were her words.
Please take us to the beach where we landed.
You have to wash them.
She wants to see what you can do.
She says, throw the piano overboard.
We can't leave the piano
Hello, then.
Do I know any gigs?
You the owner here?
Visitation is still up by two at the three-quarters.  Single Action second, Fasanella third.
What's the line on Visitation?
Naw, it's okay.
Sorry, pal.  I'll fix you up, call you a doc, but I ain't gonna walk into a bunch of knives for ya.
I'm gettin' too slow for this racket.  I done the best I'm gonna do.  You hang on too long, you start embarrassin' yourself.
But you played the Big Con.  You said it was nothin'.  A game for flakes and mama's boys.
Hell yes.  He does this every year. There's nothing to worry about.
You the Duff that didn't come up with his end when Little Jeff was sent up?
Aw Christ, it doesn't make no difference now.  If Snyder knows about it so does everybody else. He never gets anything first...Damn, there's no answer at Luther's.
Glad to meet ya, kid.  You're a real horse's ass.
He had you down as a big-timer. What happened?
Lonnegan after you, too?
Gondorff, you gonna teach me the Big Con or not?
Why?
Why didn't you tell me about Snyder before?
Take it easy, you won't lose him now.  We had him 10 years ago when he decided to be somebody.  Believe me, I've seen enough to know.
You were right, Henry.  It's not enough... But it's close.
You wanta wait for your share?
He usually plays with a Royal or a Cadenza.  I got you one of each.  He likes to cold deck low, 8's or 9's.
Yeh, that'd be real nice of ya, Mr. Lonneman.
Hi there, Snyder.  Things a little slow down at the Bunco Department tonight, eh?  Somebody lose the dominoes?
You done?
Where's June today?
All right, when?
I thought it might be good for him to see the setup.
Aw, come on, Hooker, why don't you just...
I need somebody respectable...but not completely legit.  What I'm gonna do isn't very legal.
A week's a long time, friend. Anything can happen.  All of it bad.
Tell your friend I'll have the money here by post-time tomorrow. We'll take the first race where the odds are 4-1 or better.  And make sure I can get to that window this time.
You've already done time twice, and judges don't like three time losers. You wanna sit in the can for forty years, startin' tonight?
On a 6-1 shot?  The hell with ya. We'll keep the deal we got.
We were getting 50 from our guy.
Well we do.  He's chummin' around with a Big C named Henry Gondorff. Ring any bells?
Sure.  Every bunco man in the country knows Gondorff.
There's word he's gonna run a con on the North Side here.  We got a year-old Florida warrant on him, but it's a thin beef, and he can beat it in court unless we catch him cold.  All we want you to do is pick up Hooker for us.
Don't crack wise to me, flatfoot. I spent a lotta time in dumps like this, eatin' Gondorff's dust while the bunco squad gets rich tippin' him off.  But it's not gonna happen this time.  We're not even gonna let the police know we're here.  If you keep your mouth shut and do a job, there'll be a promotion in it for ya.  And you better take it, cause I can make ya work for us without it.
Have the police got any idea where Wynant is?
All settled?  Grand!  Why did your mother ever divorce him?  He's swell.
Don't start worrying about him. He's a good guy, but screwy.
Said he stole his invention.
What are you talking about?
Dorothy.... listen to me. I love you.  Don't you understand that? I love you.
I don't know anything -- I've been in California for four years. What about his lawyer? Used to be a guy named Mac-- something.
Come on in.
You heard about Julia Wolf?
Forgive me.  How are you?
Wouldn't it be a little embarrassing ...  all of us there ...  your other and me and your stepfather?
Yes.  And I don't want anybody to steal it from me.
Goodbye, darling.  Don't you dare forget...  December 30th.
You can take that out to the car.
Shrapnel!
What is it, Gilbert? Tell mother! What did he say?
That woman!
Not a thing.
Well, I've got my alibi.  I was at the Public Library.  Where were you?
What'd he think it was to you?
I'm asking you.
No.
Who're you calling?
No.
I didn't know they had a fight.
A brown suit, brown shoes and a white shirt and a grayish tie with red, or reddish brown figures on it.
But he's interested!
What's the idea of telling me you just knew the Wolfe girl by sight?
I'll get some.
I know.
Why don't you go to see Julia? She handles his money.
What are you going to do?
Just what I said I'd do.
We're just having a little drink.
Who's that man?
I want that money right now, or I'll hand you over to the police.
That's a fine thing to throw up to me after all I've been to you....
Settle it yourself.  What have I got a lawyer for?
How are you?
Nothing, thank you.  Nothing.  I wanted to see you...  What's Mimi up to, Charles?
How are you?
Well, don't you?
But he knows you.  All you have to do is get in touch with him, and tell him that Mimi says everything is all right... but that I've got to see him.
You're lying, Mimi.  But then, you'd do anything for money.  You're getting a good price for saying you saw Wynant and you figure you won't get anything if he's dead.
How is Studsy?  I didn't know he was out of stir.
Morelli -  You knew Julia.  Was she gypping Wynant?
By the way, how is your father's side?
How many drinks have you had?
Six Martinis.
What hit me?
She didn't tell me a thing.
Don't you think you'd like to go back to detecting once in a while, just for the fun of it?
Darling, my guess is that Wynant killed Julia and Dorothy knows it. And the police'll catch him without my help.
Well, quick -- get into bed.  Are you all right?
Sure -- I don't even feel it.
Who gave it to you?
I'm stifling, but it's so pretty.  The Kirbys.
Yes.
Did I give it to you?
Why don't you?
He's just been for a walk.
I've got hunch.  I'm going down to look at Wynant's shop, I want to find out why it's closed.
He went away lots of times when I knew him - but he never closed his shop. I've got a hunch something is up.
You mean, he might be hiding there?
You wouldn't be a widow long.
Don't say it that way. Say it as if you meant it.
He was down in the shop.
Nick!
Nick, you'd better lay off that liquor.
But they all said it was Rosebreen's.
Wynant dead?  Does Dorothy know?
Why not?
I want to lie low till I get the whole dope.  I don't want to go off half-cocked.
I'm going to get the real murderer. I've got an idea.  Want to see me take him?
Got a nice evening dress?
Who do you think did it?
Come on out, now.  He won't hurt you.  Back to your old tricks, eh, Tanner?
Yes, sir.  Julia Wolf got me a job as bookkeeper.
Yes.  Nick!
Well, congratulations.
Two weeks work gone for nothing.
Home?
I'm fired.
Baghdad.
What's in the other direction?
Yeah!  Welcome to beautiful Iraq.  Land of enchantment and riches.
You two fighting's not going to get us anything.
He's an idiot, and he's not nearly as hard as he thinks.
I don't know, and I wasn't about to mess with it.
Ready?
Otherwise whatever we're looking for could be anywhere.
Where'd they go?
Stop it!
How's he going to want the gold?  He couldn't even know we had it.
I don't care what he says, he wanted our gold.  Would have slit our throats if he had the chance.
No navicom.  A lot of good you are now, Epps.
I think you've got some issues to deal with.  Really, when we get out of here I'm pretty sure it's shrink time for you.
What are you going to do with your <u>third</u>?
We run they'll shoot us anyway.  If we keep driving they might think we friendlies; Iraqis.  Or even if they know we're Americans they might get scared, think we're part of a detachment and keep on going.
What?
I'm just thinking, you know, if the rest of the boys knew what we're doing.  I mean if they knew what we were coming back with.
Hey...hey!  Slow up.  You don't have to go so fast.
Oh, God!  Oh God!
Just relax.
Where you going?
Stay low.
Think there might be more Iraqis?
Maybe we should blast it loose with the claymore.
It's just a mongoose.
Jesus, Jaeger.
Just had to get the pack unhooked from the line.  It didn't seem that long.
We'll find our way.
We got to go back.  We got to go back for Wes.
Forget Wes.
Really, I'm not.  Remember how I was talking I wanted to blow away all those Iraqis?  That's all it was was talk.  I was scared out of my mind to go to war. I still haven't gotten over stepping on that land mine.
Sorry.
We've got to keep moving while there's still light.
That's if the war is even still going on. Way things were shaping up it's probably long over.
I don't know.  Something Wes had taught me.  I think it means "Don't shoot. We're your friends."
They must have thought we were Iraqi when you yelled to them.  They couldn't tell in the dark.
And then shoot them.
What do we do?
Somebody has to.
Yeah.  Even after that.  You didn't take it out on me, except for maybe making me lie in the middle of the road now.  But I'd say you've been very fair.  I just think it's a hell of a man who can keep from going money simple.
I've never been anywhere.  I wouldn't know where to go.  Where would you go?
I'd go to Australia.  Lot of land, not many people.  I think after this I'd like to quit people for awhile.  And the girls go crazy for brothers down there.
We ought to kick their asses anyway. Even if they do get out of Kuwait we ought to kick their asses.
How do you say "Come here, baby.  I'm horny."  I can use that now.
Now you need me.
That's in two days.
Like I said; so?
They're cancelling all leaves, all passes.  No more drills.  We stand at full ready starting--
It doesn't mean anything.
We're going to get court martialed, you know that.
This is too much.  You don't even have the money and you're wasting it.
Iraqis.
Two vehicles.  They're not supposed to be here.
Yeah, well, we're not.
We're not going anywhere.  Not 'til we get what we came for.
I can't hear him.
4732...?
I have to see SEN.  I've just been given a shift change.
Now.
You don't have to... I don't trust him.  You ought to file a report.
That's not dirt...Can't be dirt.. Dirt is a violation.
It's 3+27 hundred
Three!  I'm going to be late for my shift.
I'll try.
You slipped on a T297 transfer just before lunch, didn't you?
They know.  They've been watching us.  I can feel it.
It's the end.
You always manage to avoid the issue:  What's wrong with our present condition?  We're COMFORTABLE and we have plenty of food...I feel absolutely no threat because there is no threat. Why incite trouble?  You should examine your emotions.  It is senseless...
There goes another of your disciples.
We're leaving.
I can't see him at all.  He's been destroyed.
What?
You're in violation.
I was lost.
Which way?
What?
Maternity ward, huhh!
What kind of answer is that?
What have you done, Cut your hand?
Where's LUH?
Yes
Yes...
Hey, that's the guy-
Go ahead.
Patch me through to the Bomb Squad.
Alright, let's check it out.
Just how easy is it to build a... device?
Typical profile, usually losers, nobodies that're afraid to confront their victims. They like scaring people. That's why they call in their threats. Same mentality as obscene phone callers.
Then, it's gotta be here somewhere ...
You guys seem pretty tight.
We've gotta be. In this business, you don't exactly make alot of outside commitments.
What's up?
Cuz he got the girl, now he's leaving town.
Would you?
Good, now the other side.
That's the blasting cap - good! Okay, now grab it by the base and pull it straight up. No, Wait...
Right.
Yeah, he's helping us work up a profile on this thing.
Then why tell me?
Alex-
Why are we stopping here?
Alex, please-
Looks like the stuff my dad used to use to blow up tree stumps back in Scranton.
Unsolved bombings in the last year... Boston, New York, Philadelphia... but no real match
Mike. No thanks, I'm fine.
That guy's wife must be pretty pissed off to play a trick like that.
Make an appointment.
So what're we looking for?
Captain...
It won't work, he'll know it's a trap...
Reilly, you're done for now. What the hell were you thinking directing the Bomb Squad Team into hot pursuit. They had no business-
So you lost a handbag, madame?
Yes.
And diamonds in the front.
M'sieu Laval, Madame would like to talk to Mademoiselle Gautier for a moment.
But before I say goodbye I want to ask you one question: Have you ever been in Venice?
No.
No!
Funny, the kind of men women fall for.
Yes, Baron?
And you, M'sieu Giron, seem to be disturbing my examination of <u>this</u> <u>report</u>.
Well, that's fine. Then you are not insinuating that I am avoiding questions. And I am not insinuating that you won't let me examine this report.
You have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. You must be a man of about-- about sixty-five.  Let's see--  You will be exactly eighty-seven when you come out of prison.
M'sieu Monescu!
Thank you, Baron.
What?
They're all right, aren't they?
Gaston. Let's open it--right now! Let's get away from here!  I don't like this place!
Ã‰ysÃ©e seven, eight, nine, two.  We have to clear out.  Railroad station? Ticket office, please.
He recognized you!
<u>Am</u> <u>Berliner</u> <u>Zug</u>.
Are you insane? You've to get out of here at once! She may come back any minute.
But, Lily--
You know the main staircase in the opera?
One purse--  empty. One vanity case-- 
But really, m'sieu, this isn't necessary.
Naturally I did.
Too much blue in crimson.
Yes!
Right!
It <u>is</u> beautiful. But I got a little tired of sleeping in antiques, so I gave it to my secretary.
I see.  She must have been very happy here.
Yes, I would!
So you think you can get me?
<u>I</u> <u>love</u> <u>you</u>.
I <u>believe</u> you.
What would you say if you found your safe had been robbed?
I don't believe it!
You know what Paris is saying about the Countess Falconier and her chauffeur?
So he wouldn't be confined so much to his office--
Yes! And he would have a little more time for--
Ever had a romance with a crook?
Because I hate him--because I love you!
But you saw it here.
That's right.
Mr. Andrews, I did the sum in my head, and with the number of lifeboats times the capacity you mentioned... forgive me, but it seems that there are not enough for everyone aboard.
Please tell only who you must, I don't want to be responsible for a panic. And get to a boat quickly. Don't wait. You remember what I told you about the boats?
Shit.
She says she's Rose DeWitt Bukater, right? Rose DeWitt Bukater died on the Titanic. At the age of 17. If she'd've lived, she'd be over a hundred now.
A hundred and one next month.
We've put together the world's largest database on the Titanic. Okay, here...
Hey, Lizzy. I need to talk to you for a second.
The partners want to know how it's going?
None of the stewards have seen her.
We're too late.
So this is the ship they say is unsinkable.
Cal, stop! It was an accident.
My God... Cal. Is it a --
It was once worn by Louis the Sixteenth. They call it Le Coeur de la Mer, the --
No thanks. I'm heading back.
You're a good liar.
So you've not lit the last four boilers then?
No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go.
No.
You're crazy.
I'm Jack Dawson.
Rose. Rose DeWitt Bukater.
Mr. Dawson, I --
You're welcome. Rose.
If only it were that simple.
And these were drawn from life?
This is horseshit.
Here's to Europe!  Couldn't try to look a little less glum, could you?
Hope we're not intruding.
Montana?
Did you find it?
What did you want a gun for?
Stick-up. Needed dough to get ashore.
We haven't any chips, Mr. Brett--Do you mind playing with cash?
I should pass, but I'll trail along--I'll take three. 
You're coming back--
Where have you been hiding?
Oh--hello!  I got the flowers. That was sweet of you--thank you.
This is great. I'll be able to watch your act every night.
Very--your mother?
Well, I can't.
Would you like to take a turn around the deck with me?
Yes--you know what I've been thinking, Sally?--
I didn't <U>know</U> we were <U>going</U> to be married.
I'll give you plenty of rings as soon as I get the stones set--what do you think?
You can live that down, can't you?
Well, I'll be--!!!
You're a wise guy--Gimme back--
You don't think--?
Not a chance.
Oh, Shortie!--  --there's a girl on this ship--
Just a minute, steward--haven't you forgotten something?
My change.
Well, if that's the case, you're sure of winning the first couple of hands--But what about after that?
Have the purser give you twenty-five hundred dollars for this check--and bring the cash here.
Thank you, sir. 
What is it?
Your mother is feeling seasick and would like to see you right away.
<U>Me</U>!
How about you?
Hello, young fellow!
I'm O.K. It didn't hurt much.
In New York.
Back is in New York.
I can see where I won't talk much to you.
Looks to me like standard equipment for the Department of Street Cleaning--
He's a likable chap--he's got an honest face--
Well, I'll tell you--we picked him up about a year ago-- but could never pin anything on him.
And you've put it over--haven't you?
Women are such fools!--Why do so many of us pass up <U>right</U> guys?
But, Mary--everybody's having such a great time-- why spoil it?
Mr. Denby--What do you think I ought to do with that part?
Oh, Mr. Den-n-by!
Well, he has a straw hat--
So what?
Oh!--So that's it. Does she know he's on board?
What for?
He works the boats as a "come-on" man. We ought to make a fair combination and do a little business. Jack's a pretty good dealer himself.
That's him! That's the sucker!!
They're a cinch to read--Queen of Clubs--  --Ace of Diamonds. 
The country boy's about due.
About twelve hundred.
I wish I could.
Thanks to me.
A tipoff in the right quarter to take his fingerprints and--
--you'd go with him!
Don't, Lee--that's dead.
I wouldn't say that--  I'm glad he's dead--yes--I'd thought of killing him-- but I didn't--
Why?
Congratulations.
Sure I would--but I don't get what you're driving at.
Soon as I get that bracelet back I'm going to relax. Wish the guy that borrowed it would help me out--I got to win that fifty bucks.
I thought I had our sailing covered up--  --and here it is.
I was in his cabin--
Ain't got time.
I tell yuh I ain't got no bracelet--
Then why did you run away?
Just pick up your money and go. Sick of listening to you simper.
Yes, very.  And very married.
What'd the Messican mean, a sick Horse's gonna get us?  Didn't make No sense.
They were all gonna jump me back There.  What ever happened to one Against one?
I'm sorry.  If there was any other-
I want you to know it's over. We're leaving and we're not Coming back.
No Marshal, you don't understand. I'm through with lawing, I'm Through with the whole Proposition.  Forever.  I did my Duty, now I'd like to get on with My life.  That is if you don't Mind.  Jesus.  Good day now.
You retired, too?
Credat Judaeus Apella.
My fight's not with you, Holliday.
Better.
What's that mean, Doc?  You know I Don't understand when you talk up High like that.  You mean you Don't want to be my lovin' man no more?
I said poker's an honest trade. Only suckers buck the tiger.  The Odds are all with the house.
I don't know.  Probably ignore her.
A man like Ringo's got a great Empty hole right through the Middle of him and no matter what He does he can't ever fill it.  He Can't kill enough or steal enough Or inflict enough pain to ever Fill it.  And it drives him mad. Sick mad.  Cold and dirty.
I played the cards I was dealt, Wyatt.  Your problem is you're Always trying to play someone Else's.  Allow me to tell you the Truth and thus set you free: There is no happiness, Wyatt There is no normal life.  There's Only life, that's all.  Just life. The rest is relative.
What?
Drunks.  Crawfished a bet, called Him a liar.  I saw the whole thing.
Not half as bad as I feel.
Hey Creek, you ever see anything Like that before?
I'm not touchy, I just, it's a Silly question, that's all.  Am I Happy?  Are you happy?
What's wrong?
Josie... No, I'm gonna call you Sadie.
I have nothing left.  I have Nothing to give you.  I have no Pride, no dignity, no money.  I Don't even know how we'll make a Living.  But I promise I'll love You every second of your life.
Let me have one of those cigars.  Kinda nice in here.  You run it?
Wyatt, I couldn't find a single Store that had laudanum any-
Just go.  It's all right.  Wyatt, Really.  Work well.
That what you got me up here for?
McMasters, isn't it?  Listen, you Seen a black stallion with-
I know that cut.  You mean there's A waterhole near there?
Like you said, just gotta know How to handle 'em.  Old Fred Wasn't up to it.  We know that We're doin', Wyatt.
Will somebody get the damn dog out-
Yeah.  It's a fact.
Go ahead.  Skin it.  Skin that Smoke wagon and see what happens.
Way ahead of you, Wyatt.  You want Us to help you get Ike Clanton And Johnny Behan.  Everybody knows They're the ones to blame for Your brothers.
Keep your eye on that brass ring. Don't let anything side-track you.
Wait till the liquor wears off. Once they start getting headaches They'll lose interest.
Ike Clanton, Old Man's eldest Son.  Know he ain't got the stuff, Makes him miserable.
I appreciate your assistance, M. But this is now a military operation.
At least we know where the gold is. When are the recovery ships due?
I call this the Rogue's gallery.
...So that's what the weapons grade uranium was for.
Hello, James. Enjoy your meeting?
Do you have any idea of what any of that means? In English?
His newspapers?
Yeah. Russian Minister of Transportation.
I envy your 'undercover' assignments.
I have to get these to London. Do you know this Captain Cheong?
They point, I shoot.
... Kids?
Thanks.  Take care -
Boyfriend?
That's funny: you struck me as the kind of man who always carries protection.
Harmsway sank that ship and stole the gold. It's on the Sea Dolphin II.  And thanks to your little show and tell -  - giving him the evidence -  We're the only ones who can tie him to the crime.
Not a lot of difference.
Are you listening to me?
Here. You shoot. I'll drive.
Sleep well?
First, that boat is in international waters. I'm claiming it for salvage. One-third of that gold is mine.
If you think we're going to have some kind of 'life affirming' romance here just because we cheated death, let me be clear:  We're going to have it where I want, and when I want.
Tell me, 007, what do you know about Elliot Harmsway?
- Along with Tomorrow - the first world-wide newspaper. Circulation 27 million. Daily. -
You're to wear this mask at the Venice Carnival, and wait to be contacted.
I was just getting to the interesting part!
Who's in charge here?
Damn. It's doing it again.
Please, Sidney. I'd like to remember you fondly.
I regret to inform you, sir, that Saddam Hussein is still demanding a bonus for his role in the Gulf War.
How come you're not wearing my shoes?
When are you boys going to fix that roof?
You want me to mortgage my house to invest in a scheme of yours? You know the last time we went into something together Daddy had to go in his savings to keep us from ending on the street.
That is a damn lie and you know it. Every time father asks you to do something, you either half-ass do it or run off and hide. Mama asked you to turn the dirt in her garden and you told her, with your smart ass self, that you weren't a farmer; get Junior to do it. Every time someone asks you to do something, you always say, tell Junior to do it. Boy, you ought to grow up.
I'm leaving and don't even call me when the shoe falls 'cause all he did for me was to try and run my life. I'm tired of people saying Babe Brother this, Babe Brother that. What's my name?
I've heard some foolish things in my life.
You probably heard the wind stirring up those dead leaves over there.
I always had chickens, ducks and whatnots.
I asked you to wake me when Babe Brother comes.
I'm worn out.
It's good to be able to hear that.
Haven't the years been good to Hattie?
One can tell you are from back home. These people nowadays don't know what manners are.
I hope that it's nothing serious.
He has never gotten rid of the malaria. He is usually up and at it the next day. I'm going to make him fresh chicken broth.
Some people grow up and change their ways.
Not you mustn't touch. Your mama might not like you handling knives.
Did you have your child at home?
Everybody who have been associated with Harry end up with pennies over their eyes.
You shouldn't talk about the boy's father in front of him. This is family business and we have to pull together.
Where is Skip?
Can we leave this up 'til we move?
Can I bring some toys?
You can bring ONE toy...
Well, honey, just grab some other toy!  Now c'mon!
Yeah?!
Yeah -- when you're sixteen.
But what if we leave them behind?
Woody!  Buzz!
Uh, let what?  I don't -- Uh, what do you mean?  Who?
We're almost there.
Yes, it is a mistake, because, you see, the bed, here, is my spot.
Well, let's see, we've got double A's --
Yes.  They're Andy's toys.
What's going on?
That's why.  Sid.
Buzz!!  Oh, Buzz, Buzz Lightyear!! Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness! We've got trouble!
C'mon, c'mon, that's it...
No, it is.  Look, over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest, and it's not because you're a Space Ranger, pal, it's because you're a TOY!  You are HIS toy.
I can't do it!  Take care of Andy for me!
It's not a laser!  It's a little lightbulb that blinks!
Ohhh!  You sunk it!
I dunno.
Hey!!
Oh, no!
Will you quit moving around?!
A lunchbox?!
Who is it this time?
No, no, no!  You got it all wrong, Potato Head.  Buzz is fine!  Buzz is right here.  He's with me!
No!  No!  Don't leave!  Don't leave! You've gotta help us, please!  You don't know what it's like over here!
Toss 'im overboard!
Hey look!  It's Buzz!
It's Sid!
We believe you, Woody.  Right, Rex?
W-w-w-we?
Woody, what are you doing under the bed?
I can't hold on much longer!
There's no mirror.
Do you know you've lovely hair, even if you torment it in those braids.
He can't abide a woman in trousers. He says a woman in trousers is a sin against nature.
Don't fret. It's only his dream. Dreams aren't catching, not like measles.
Well ... yes. All right. But -
He'll murder you when he finds out.
I've got a present for you...
Did you do this?
You're well built; how old are you?
Anna.  What's wrong?  What do you want?
I am on the board of my son's school. I had a fundraiser for A.L.V. in my front yard.  I have a right to know if my husband is a legitimate businessman.
If all our assets are frozen and our "sales force" has scattered...  How am I supposed to survive?  I'm giving birth in three months.  How do I get through this?
I tried, Arnie.  And, I will continue to try.
Helena --
Did you get it?
Why?
I think we may have found our Mexican Drug Czar.  It's this General, Salazar.  At least I'll have somebody on the other side I can talk to.
No, I don't think so.  Leave me alone, give me money.  That's what I get from our daughter.  She has a way of shutting me out that seems very familiar.
What's up?
You all right?
Where is it?  Where are the drugs?  Where are they?
Yeah.
What's that mean?
What is this, like freebase?
She ain't in on it.
So does half of San Diego.
What do you think she wants?
You can learn a lot about somebody from this stuff.  Three categories: you like me, you hate me, you want something from me.  Definitely third category.
What would a law firm want from the new drug Czar?
All the professionals keep them in the trunk.
David --
Listen you motherfucker, you tried to kill me with a fucking cannon.
So go shower already.
Bring this man a change of good clothes.  Has he eaten?
I'm six months pregnant.  I won't do it.
Guzman, Tomas, Esteban --
Oh, really.  General Salazar was there?
An informant.
I'm trying to bust the Tijuana Cartel.
I hope when you were on the bench, Judge Wakefield, you didn't handle the presumption of innocence in the same fashion.
You won't say anything to my parents?
What?  I thought Madrigal was dead. I thought it was verified.
What do we do?  Okay.  Fucked-up Bowman's turning blue.  Doctor.  We need a doctor.
Did you tell him?
I'm sorry.
Well, why didn't you bring them?
Hey, I'm wanting a bet put on.
We'll be half-way down the road with the money.
Cool down, Franco. The guy's sorry.
Diane.
Calm down, I'm just asking. Is that hash I can smell?
You're not getting any younger, Mark. The world is changing, music is changing, even drugs are changing. You can't stay in here all day dreaming about heroin and Ziggy Pop.
Unless you get caught.
That's right: 'going steady' for four weeks now.
Tommy, let's put the tape on.
Yes, I want to watch ourselves while we're screwing.
Indeed, yes, those halcyon days.
No, actually I went to Craignewton but I was worried that you wouldn't have heard of it so I put the Royal Edinburgh College instead, because they're both schools, right, and we're all in this together, and I wanted to put across the general idea rather than the details, yeah? People get all hung up on details, but what's the point? Like which school? Does it matter? Why? When? Where? Or how many O grades did I get? Could be six, could be one, but that's not important. What's important is that I am, right? That I am.
Morning, Spud. Sit down and have some breakfast.
No, I'll wash them. I'll take them home and bring them back.
No problem for me either.  Honestly, it's no problem.
No.
And you might get the fucking job.
You Only Live Twice?
Screenwriter?
You don't know, do you?
What do you mean?
No, it's not bad, but it's not great either, is it? And in your heart you kind of know that although it sounds all right, it's actually just shite.
So who else?
I think Allison had been screaming all day, but it hadn't really registered before. She might have been screaming for a week for all I knew. It's been days since I've heard anyone speak, though surely someone must have said something in all that time, surely to fuck someone must have.
It wasn't that bad.
What?
No, he didn't make me touch it.
Why would I want to sell my passport?
Four Grand.
What's on the menu this evening?
Regret to inform, sir, that your credit limit was reached and breached a long time ago.
No, thank you. I'll proceed directly to the intravenous injection of hard drugs, please.
Such as?
There.
Yes, but then she finds out I've bought a ticket for Iggy Pop the same night.
Went ballistic?
Mr. Murphy, {leaving your friend aside,} do you see yourself as having any weaknesses?
Admit it. We're lost.
Plotting our new course.
What's Emergency Landing Plan B?
Oh, please.
What do you know of my pain?
Join my quest.
Head down that tunnel to the hydro vent and turn right. Then left at the blowscreen. You can't miss it.
On the contrary. Gravity is foremost on my mind. Look, I'm trying to make an ascent here. Why don't you go pester Dr McCoy for a while?
Oh, God
Jim.
What do you mean?
When he encouraged others to follow him, he was banished from Vulcan, never to return.
You did too. Sybok couldn't possibly be your brother because I happen to know for a fact that you don't have a brother.
There's got to be a way out of this place.
Is what possible?
It would appear we are too heavy.
Spock... the booster rockets.
I trust your message was received?
Now learn something about yourself.
You are mad!
About the ship...



"Let's see what she's got," said the Captain. And then we found out, didn't we?
I know you'll whip her into shape, Scotty. You always do.
Uhura, I thought you were on leave.
Sybok, you must surrender.
No, nyet, negatory, not on your tintype, no way.
only yes and no...  You're a bit.
Way to go! We're haulin'!
Flynn?
The Pentagon?
Now, wait a minute -- I wrote you.
Walter, I sympathize, but I have data coming out of the Master Control Program saying there is something screwy --
Who is your User, program?
Alan!
What, just the three of us?
Flynn...  Where's Ram?
Not us, I hope.
A User -- in our world?
Elementary physics... a beam of energy can always be diverted... ooh, my head  Are we there yet, Mommy?
Why? What are you going to do?
You'll be having plenty of chances to get hurt, don't worry about that.
Oh, uh...I don't remember too much...
It's all circuits...  Must be an input/output component...
PARAMUS... wonder what those initials stand for ...  ...probably Program Assist Routine -- well, it sounds like a lovely place.
What's goin' on?
A User?
The Users...you really think they're still there?
I mean, it's not like he's saving the world or anything.  He's a sales rep for Chrissakes. Whenever I can't get to sleep I ask him to tell me about his day. Six seconds and I'm out.  But he acts like he's curing cancer or something.
I'm shocked.
Harry only has two moods: busy...				* and asleep.
Just an hour?  You should tell this stud to take more time.
Honey that song came out in 1968, when I was exactly your age.
And this is a little above market-				* rate for the horizontal bop, even				* for a total biscuit like her.
Alright, I want a complete workup on her.  Do we know where she is?
And the second you left there, we started getting calls to the					* ghost numbers.  They were checking out the Renquist front.
Kids.  Ten seconds of joy. Thirty years of misery.
Fourteen, Harry.
You better watch it.  She might file on you for sexual harassment.
It's all set up...  ghost phones and fax, all the usual stuff. You have a suite at the Marquis Hotel under Renquist.  Okay, reality check.  Go.
What?  It's on the way.  She says she's got something for me.
So, you wanna play huh?  You little--
Just hang a minute.
He-- Helen.  Helen-- it's Helen. It's Helen, Gib.
Congratulations.  Welcome to the club.
Put a tap on her phone.
Goddamnit, Harry.  This is our butts.  So your life is in the toilet.  So your wife is banging a used car salesman.  Sure it's humiliating.  But be a man here--
You tell on me, I tell on you.
Now what?
Let's go.  I'll brief you in the air.
I can get 3 Marine Corps Harriers here in about 12 minutes. They're on maneuvers out of Boca Chica.
Any minute now.
Yes sir.
Yes what?
This is Samir.  See if you can guess his specialty.
Come on to bed, you don't have to brush your teeth.
I'll just be a second.  So what happened tonight at the office?
It's the big client in Japan, and it's the middle of the morning there and their whole system is crashed... this guy's having a meltdown--
Let me handle this part.  Do you mind?  Why did you go to Carlos' hideout?
What?
I think so.
Let the hooker go.  She's not important.
I don't know what this crazy bitch is on.  You should just cut her loose, so we can get down to business.
I'm sorry, honey.
17 years.
Yes.
As much as you used to?
What're we talking about here? Pussy, right?
See.  You and this car were meant for each other.  Why fight it? Sure, I have a couple other buyers lined up, but I like your style.  Whattya say?  Should we start on the paperwork?
Of course.  Mrs. Tasker.  And what were you going with the international terrorist, Carlos the Jackal?  Taking dictation?
Get going! 
Who's your little friend?
I'm Helen Tasker.  Harry's my husband.  And you are?
Now just keep your knees together, and you'll be fine.
Something you obviously have a hard time doing!
Like one?
I kept looking back, like you taught me.  I didn't see anyone.
Tell me what happened?
Right, of course.  I was worried when I didn't hear from you that night.
Were they trying to kill you?					*
You can call me Simon.  You're very brave to do this...  You opened it.
What do you want me to do?
You got that playing basketball?
Oh, look what happened. Oh god, I'm so sorry. Are you OK?
How 'bout me what?
Do you get paid a lot?
You know when you sat behind me?
At the movies?
I love Janis.
She OD'd, didn't she?
Uh-huh.
Sweetheart, write down your former address.
Ya know, I used to fuckin' hate airports.
You ain't kiddin', we got lives to start over, we should go somewhere where we can really start from scatch.
Can you live with it?
You wanna get unhaunted?
I was dying. I thought for sure everyone could see it on my face.
You comin' to L.A.? When?
Well, there's a story behind all that. I'll tell you when I see you. By the way, I won't be alone. I'm bringing my wife with me.
Alabama, could you tell Clar -
It's fuckin' real!  It's fuckin' real!
I'm offering a half a million dollars worth of white for two hundred thousand. How difficult can that be?
Hardly anything. I wasn't sure from your letter what was bullshit, and what wasn't.
Elliot Blitzer.
The zoo.  What are you waiting for?
Would you just shut up a minute and let me think?
Clarence.
In case.
Do you really mean it?
When he was alive. I wouldn't fuck him now.
He is, bar none, the greatest actor working in martial arts movies ever.
Leave the gorillas.
He wants to talk ya.
I can see what you mean.
OK, sorry, Lee. I just wanna tell you "Coming Home in a Body Bag" is one of my favorite movies. After "Apocalypse Now" I think it's the best Vietnam movie ever.
You know, most movies that win a lot of Oscars, I can't stand. "Sophie's Choice", "Ordinary People", "Kramer vs. Kramer", "Gandhi". All that stuff is safe, geriatric, coffee-table dog shit.
Now, that's practically uncut. You could, if you so desire, cut it a helluva lot more.
I think there's a Seven-Up in there.
She seems very nice.
What?
Do you still have friends on the force?
If you don't hang around in this circle, no reason it should.
Who is he?
That's what I've been tellin' ya. The guy was like a mad dog. So the cops aren't looking for me?
Well, son, I want you to know I hope everything works out with you and Alabama. I like her. I think you make a cute couple.
We do make a cute couple, don't we?
I'm glad. Hopefully that will clear up the how-full-of-shit-I-am question you've been asking yourself. Now, we're gonna have a little Q and A, and, at the risk of sounding redundant, please make your answers genuine.  Want a Chesterfield?
No.
That's of minor importance. But what's of major fuckin' importance is that I believe you. Where did they go?
Could I have one of those Chesterfields now?
It's about that pimp that was shot a couple of days ago, Drexl Spivey.
If we decided on making him a New York type, could you do that?
Could we try it now?
But a fuckin' baggie.
You're no longer an extra -
Krinkle, this is it. We got it, man. And it's all ours. I mean talk about fallin' into somethin'. You shoulda seen it, it was beautiful. Dimes is hittin' him from the left about being fucked in the ass by niggers, I'm hittin' him form the right about not likin' pussy anymore, finally he starts  cryin', and then it was all over -
He's so spooked he'd turn over his momma, his daddy, his two-panny granny, and Anna and the King of Siam if he had anything on him.
You do more than try.
How's he supposed to see the wire?
What was I sayin'?
Rock whores.
Why you trippin'? We jus' fuckin' with ya. But I wanna ask you a question. You with some fine bitch, I mean a brick shithouse bitch - you're with Jayne Kennedy. You're with Jayne Kennedy and you say "Bitch, suck my dick!" and then Jayne Kennedy says, "First things first, nigger, I ain't suckin' shit till you bring your ass over here and lick my bush!" Now, what do you say?
If it came down to who eats who, damn skippy.
No.
Maybe you can help me. Actually, who I'm looking for is a friend of ours from Detroit. Clarence Worley? I heard he was in town. Might be travelling with a pretty girl named Alabama. Have you seen him? Are they stayin' here?
Yes.
Do you know where we can find him?
No.
Well?
We want tough minded people.  Strong mentally.  We've had some...misfortunes with "unstable" types.
But just until you recover your, uh,... equilibrium.
Wow, a guy in a Chevy is chasing her and some other guy I can't see.
Meaning...???
To find out where the virus is so a qualified scientist can travel back into the past and study the original virus.
Mr. Cole?  My name is Doctor Railly. I'm a psychiatrist.  I work for the County -- I don't work for the police. My only concern is your well being -- do you understand that?
Do you know why you're here, James.
Because I'm a good observer.  Because I have a tough mind.
A jail?  Prison?
Why do you think there aren't any germs in the air, James?
1995?
Yes, I remember.  Why do you want to go to Philadelphia?
You'd prefer that? ... James...you don't really have a gun, do you.
Oh, Jesus, James!  You killed him!
You didn't have a gun before, did you?
You're sure?
Okay...you were standing there looking at the moon...you were eating grass... then what?
You disappeared!  One minute you were there, the next minute you were gone. Did you run through the woods?
The boy in the well.  How did you know that was just a hoax?
It's a Carpet Cleaning Company...
You... you left them a message?
I think I've seen this movie before. When I was a kid.  It was on TV.
If we can't change anything...because it's already happened, then we ought to at least smell the flowers.
Why are we doing this?
Well, you look pretty different, too.
No!  Look, I don't belong here!  What I need to do is make a telephone call to straighten everything out.
Who would you call, Mr. Cole, who would straighten everything out?
If you know how to escape, why don't you...?
They hurt you!
This part isn't about the virus, is it?
Hey, man...
It's about obeying, about doing what you're told.
WHY DON'T WE FORGET MY GODDAMN PSYCHIATRIST AND DEAL WITH THE TASK AT HAND.  THIS IS IMPORTANT.
-- so they get there and they ask the guy real nice for some kind of i.d., and he gets agitated, starts screaming about viruses. Totally irrational, totally disoriented, doesn't know where he is, what day it is, alla that stuff.  All they got was his name.  They figure he's stoned out of his mind, it's some kinda psychotic episode, so they're gonna bring him...
That would explain the bruises, I guess.  The struggle.
No, thank you.
Nine thirty
On your normal mornin', okay, plenty a time, but today, gotta take inta account your Army-of-the-Twelve-Monkeys factor.
You want something, old man?
Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?
Christ no!
I said I was sorry.
That a fact?
Maybe I do.
What do you want for free?
Maybe one day I'll get to sit on a corner and spout wise.
Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.
Any parting words of wisdom?
Never heard of it.  It's got no day or date.  Hell, it ain't even got numbers.  What's the matter?  You couldn't afford a Timex?
One-hundred-thirteen degrees.  That was back in July of forty-seven. Now there ain't no way it's gonna be hotter than that.
It's nonsense.
But, in particular?
We have a bus to Mexico.  Arrives in two hours.  Have to make a couple of connections, but it will get you across the border.
The ticket is thirty dollars.
You want somethin'?
Yep.
I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
What time is it now?
Look, I just want to pick up my car.
She's all yours. Put a new hose in it, and she runs like a dream now.
A God damn radiator hose in a sixty- four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose?
That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
I don't know, but it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through.  Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.
Listen, Darrell, about that hundred- fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll--
What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumble weed hick.
It is morning.
I want my car.
Now that you're so well off, can I get you something, Hon?
You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.
Lord!  Put the baby in the icebox. Killed the poor thing.
Yes.  Yes it is.
Oh my God, Jake, no.  If it is someone they'll go away.  Or call the police.  Don't go out there.
You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
I guess I've got wander in my blood.
What happens if you lose?
That's good.  Cools you right off.  I saw you watching me.
A medicine man?
I like them.  I was sick of looking at this room.  I think they add a little life.
I have ideas.
You flirt with me, then you run cold.  You lead me on, then slap me down.  I don't go for being jerked around.
Doesn't the heat bother you?
Did you ever?
All this nothing?  I've spent my life in this stinking desert.  It doesn't get to Jake like it got to me.  He doesn't mind being out here. He doesn't mind being nothing but a land broker.  Big fish in a small pond, he says.  More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.
I don't know how.
Is that so bad?  It's not like I wouldn't try to make him happy.  For awhile, anyway.  I mean, I would . . . do things for him.  I guess I'm no good that way.  I guess I tried to sucker you along like that.  Do you hate me for it?  I wouldn't blame you if you did.  But maybe it's like you said:  You just got to do whatever it takes to get out.
How far is it to California?
Yeah.
I can't.
Where?
If the key's on him, to get the key we'd have to . . .
I thought you would be on your way to Vegas by now.  Is there something you wanted?
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
I don't give a damn about the money. I want you, and I want to get us out of this shithole.  There's only one way to do that.
Why the hell didn't you do anything?
There has to be!
It's got to be here.  I heard him talk about it.  He bragged about it. Six steps out, three left.
This is good.  This is real good. This is so good they might not even charge us with murder when they catch us.  They'll probably just lock us up for being idiots.
There's easily a hundred-thousand in there.  More than that.
He was a crooked bastard.  He would have killed us.
I think I busted my leg.
I'm here.
Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.
Where you headed?
I'm surprised to see you.  I thought you'd be halfway to Vegas by now.
I'm not rambling.
You meant it.
And what does that make you?
I put it at fifty-thousand dollars, minus your cut, of course.  Which is?
That's a bit much.
I went to your place.  We talked, just like you told me.  We drove out into the desert . . .
Drop it, Jake.
Yeah, well, me too.
You could say.  I don't even have it yet.
Fifty dollars more.  That's a lot of money when you don't have a dime. And where'd you plan on getting the money from?  Maybe you thought you'd pay your friend Jake McKenna a visit.
You're right.  I don't give a damn about her.  But to fuck a man's wife behind his back?  That just makes a fool out of him.  I don't like being made a fool of.
I don't blame you.  What man would? I admit it, okay?  I came back here and I made it with Grace.  But if you kill me you're making a big mistake.
You'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life.
I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
Fine.  I was making time with your girl.  Now I'm all scared, and I'll never make that mistake again.  Now go away.
Mister!
I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm beating you up.
Let me guess.  This robber; he gets your money.
No.  He gets shot by the old lady.
You're the gambler.  You tell me.
What happened?
I guess.
Wouldn't know anything about it.
Nice night for a drive.  Morning really.  I guess that's about the only way to keep cool; riding around with the top down on a fancy convertible in the first hours of the day.
Not taking a drive, Sheriff. Heading out of town.
Just step from the car.  Nice and slow.
I think you might just want to do as I say.
Eh?
No police!  Wait until I'm gone.
Hey!  You there!
Hell no, I can't do that myself.  I'm blind.  Can't you see that?
I'm sorry, I didn't--
I'm a little short Pops. I'll catch you next time.
I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm stompin' your ass.
Now, what's this?
Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.
Say, what happened to your hand?
Bobby Cooper.
You a sailor man?  That'd be the life. Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away.  A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
Hey!
Would you?
You want to do this yourself?  I don't have to do this, you know.
That's a thick change of heart from this afternoon.
You have a lot of talk in you, whole lot of talk.
How the hell did you know where the bedroom's at?
What?
'Cause Harlin used to own it.
So?
How much time?
Well ... you got your parts, you got your labour ... let's call it a hundred-fifty bucks.
It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.
No charge.
Yep.  For the hose.  But while you was gone I replaced a gasket.  That's going to run you another fifty.
Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  Didn't you read the sign.
Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
Look, Harlin.
What the fuck did you do to my trunk?
Hablar slowly, por favor.  My ingles no es bien.
I'm just going to my car?
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
Jesus.
Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road.
You're lucky you didn't break down in the desert.  Day like today, you'd be dead in no time. When you leaving?
Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
You've been around.
So, what is it you do, Mister...?
I never played tennis. You just travel around Bobby-- no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
All this nothing? It doesn't get to Jake like it gets to me.  He says he don't mind being nothing but a big fish in a small pond.  More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.
Nothing.
Oh yeah. It's far, it's another world.
Where?
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace. 
Bobby?  What the hell's the matter with you?
I ... nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell.
Get real Bobby. He was gonna kill you <u>and</u> me.
Hope is a four-letter word.
Bobby? Are you all right?
That's a shame, Bobby.  A real shame.
And that's not the half of it, Mr. Arkadin...
Heineken?
No.  Just plain ol' Miller. Now you can fuckin' take it or you can fuckin' leave it.
Shasta!  Now why'd you go and scare the nice man like that?  Sorry about that, mister.  Let's see, you want $3.25.  You try to have a nice day now, would you?
My lord, that little baby of yours Virgil, has gotten cuter'n a bunny's nose.
Morning Sheriff. Got my drapes.
I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you.  Remember?
You never said anything.  About the drapes.
Ya little bitch, you like it don't you! You like it this way -- rough and hard. Gotta go fuck around on me, like your Mama, but you always gotta come home to Daddy, don't you, cause you know Daddy's the best.
Honest, Toby.  I just axed him for a quarter for the jukebox.
I want to stay.
Toby!  Toby Tucker, leave him alone!
Where's the fire sweetheart? Don't know how they work things in Nevada, but we got speed limits in this state.
No sir he is not.  I read about you in the paper.
Proceed.
What did I say?
I'm still going to New York. Just not this second.
Do you remember me getting sick?
...I think rust.
Soft and Wet. That's very interesting.
What about the game?
This city has had its share of disasters. Well publicized ones. It was around the time of that plane crash, when it first entered my head. And there it stayed, as I waited and watched the news over the years...  And then one day I see a news report on a train accident and its sole survivor who was miraculously unharmed.  And just like that, an idea blossoms into the flower of possible reality.
What do you want?
I have to go now.
He's kind of a miracle.
What things?
No.
No.
I'm not scared.
You're lying.
It's my field. I represent athletes. I'm an agent.
Not really.
Against a window.
No more sitting in this room. I've let it go on long enough.
Down the street and across. Greely's Beer Garden and Billiard parlor. Just ask for Alice and say you want a game of billiards.
He's coming ain't he?
I admire that, you being true to your wife. I've seen a lot of... of men... who weren't.
Yeah, I guess.
Roof? Jesus, Skinny, I done practically every damn thing myself. Roberts boy hauled wood, that's all.
Them whores, they been fuckin' an' fuckin' all them cowboys that come into town the last two weeks...
Word must have got all the way to Texas by now.
You know how women kin lie... I knock 'em around a little, ask 'em where the money is, they say they don't have none?... but they coulda squirreled away that much, the five of 'em. Maybe. 
You work for the railroads too, Mister Beauchamp?
That is you there, ain't it, Bob? The Duck of Death?
Meaning the duck himself, I guess.
Huh? Oh.  Another one, huh? Shit, I guess I'm clean out of receptacles.
Little Bill. The... the Bar T boys caught him and Little Bill...
Then... what?
I could of... easy.
What for?
You're goin' back with him?
Well... I don't recollect.
You missed him? You didn't...?
Cover me, Kid, while I mount.
Yeah?
I trust you, Bill.
P-p-p-please, I'm not armed.  M-m-my G-god. You killed... Little Bill.
Wh-wh-when confronted by superior numbers, the experienced gunfighter will fire on the best shots first.
Whaddaya do, just use your hand?
Well, I ain't like that no more, Ned. I ain't no crazy, killin' fool.
Claudia... ain't here, Bill.
I'm goin' on down to Kansas.
The Kid, yeah...
N-nobody... only you took your shotgun an' that pistol an'...
What was you shootin' at us for, anyhow?
Far enough.
Fuck you.
We're gonna need more food... at least three days worth...
An' if I spot 'em?
Jack. What are you doing here?
We know, but our man says no way on the dope. This Hungarian tells me the whole bunch was pulling stumps for Turkey the next' day. They had no time to negotiate that kind of product and no means to move it.
What was the money for?
Now remember, this is another kind of business. They don't earn your respect. You owe it to them. Don't stare them down but don't look away either. Confidence. They are fools not to trust you. That's the attitude.
They'll never stop.
I love you.
You heard right.
Roger really. People say I talk too much.
We've met once or twice. Last time was in...
Fenster and Hockney?
Who's your boss?
Listen to me, cocksucker. There is no Keyser Sate. If you say his name again, I'11 kill you right here.
Take your time. Enjoy L.A.
The job got thrown to me by this lawyer.
Someplace else, then.
What?
That's crazy, Dave and it doesn't matter. He has total immunity and his story checks out. He doesn't know what you want to know.
His name was Arturo Marquez. A petty smuggler out of Argentina. He was arrested in New York last year for trafficking. He escaped to California and got picked up in Long Beach. They were setting up his extradition when he escaped again. Get this - Edie Finneran was called in to advise the proceedings.
Sure. Fifteen years ago, but he was a good thief Anyway, the cops wouldn't let him go legit.
You think I don't know you held out on the D.A.? What did you leave out of that testimony? I can be on the phone to Ruby Deemer in ten minutes.
No. But I'm sure Keaton's dead.
I came clean. I told it like it happened on the boat. So what if I left out how I got there? It's got so many holes in it, the D.A. would've told me to blow amnesty out my ass. So you got what you wanted out of me. Big fucking deal.
McManus was furious. He was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit. That night we got the call.
He was a stool pigeon for the Justice Department. He swore out a statement to Federal Marshals that he had seen and could positively identify one Keyser Soze and had intimate knowledge of his business, including, but not exclusive to, drug trafficking and murder.
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
He used all of you to get him on that boat. He couldn't get on alone and he had to pull the trigger himself to make sure he got his man. The one man that could identify him.
Where are you going to go, Verbal? You gonna run? Turn states evidence. You might never see trial. If somebody wants to get you, you know They'll get you out there.
Weapons. Misdemeanor one.
Yes.
Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?
I want to settle this thing and be done with it.  I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.
It's a generous offer, Mr. Galvin... ...nothing can make the woman well...but we try to compensate...to make a gesture...
Yes.
Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount.  Two Hundred Ten Thousand.  That would mean I keep seventy.
... yes.  Get her on the phone ...
Say it.
Yes.
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
Thank you, your Honor.  We object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetemt and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code:  'The admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.'  And, your Honor, having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now:  we object to the admission of the Xerox form.
It's a crime.
No.
Yes.
Yes.
I...yes.
...what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it fouryears?  This is a...why?  Why would you do that?
I doubt we'll have to go to trial ...
I completely understand ...
Hold on a second.
Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least?   You know what CODE BLUE means?
Are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice?
...I made a reservation at...
No, you did fine.
You know...sometimes people can surprise you.  Sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth.
I.  Yes.  It is.
Dr. Gruber ...
... Deborah Ann Kaye ...
We have to ... we ... we have to keep you under wraps.  Please don't, don't discuss ...
... that's perfectly all right.
Nothing happened.
Who put my client in the hospital for life.
I didn't do it, Mister.
Why is that?
And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself.    I myself would take it and run like a thief.
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
Sustained.  Yes.  The witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records.
What?
If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...
Are you done?
...Would you, would you call him up.  I'll give you my number, and ask him...
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
We get it at work.  We get the magazine at work.
I changed my life today.  What did you do?
Oh, actually it was.  Then why'd you call it off?
And is that what you're going to do?    Is that what you're going to do...?
You're going to stay here...?
Thank you.
I had an appointment at his office, I think I must have got it wrong. We had a meeting...
Fuck you.  I got a call today from Sally Doneghy ...
... now who is that ...?
One lousy letter eighteen months ago. . . .I try to throw a fuckin' case your way ...
What?
I know what I said but not now. You won it.  Franky.  You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won.  We don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you...?  You know who the attorney is for the Archdiocese, Eddie Concannon.
What I'm saying, they're getting some help.
Oh shit, what's today?
Yeah.  I'm awake.
She didn't do anything.  She took the patient's history and signed the charts.  'K.C.'  'Kathy Costello...'
... I understand ...
I, what are you talking about?  I talked to her this morning, and she said...
You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted...
Dr. Towler...
Yes, the roving nurse...
Franky can't make it.  He had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later.  I'm Mickey Morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other.
Should I?
No. We have ways of digging out knowledge. But it takes longer. He is suffering from acute melancholia, together with a guilt complex. He blames himself for what happened to the woman. And we know little of the background.
No. But one assumes obligations. My wife's family is all gone; someone has to look after her interest. Her father's partner runs the company yard in the East -- Baltimore -- so I decided as long as I had to work at it, I'd come back here. I've always liked it here.
Shouldn't you be sitting down?
Not what you think. We're very happily married.
If I told you I believe that his happened to my wife, what would you say?
I'd say you'd better take her to the nearest psychiatrist, psychologist, neurologist, psychoanalyst, or plain family doctor. And have him check you both.
I can get you a firm of private eyes to follow her for you. They're dependable, good boys --
Well, that explains it. Anyone could develop an obsession for the past, with a background like that.
Knows nothing of a grave out at Mission Dolores, or an old house an Eddy Street, or a portrait at the Palace of the Legion of Honor?
No, she's all right. She's still here. But I'll get her home soon.
Could I ask you a couple of questions?
What for? Who are you?
I've heard that one before, too. I remind you of someone you used to be madly in love with, but she ditched you for another guy, and you've been carrying the torch ever since, and then you saw me and something clicked.  Huh!
I warn you, I can yell awfully loud.
About three years.
Don't go.
They're none of them right.
No, I don't want any clothes! I don't want anything! I want to get out of here!
Judy, I want to tell you: these few days have been the first happy days I've had in a year.
Yes.
Where shall we go for dinner?
No, Ernie's is fine.
I told you. I have to go back into the past. Once more. For the last time.
I need you.
Scottie --
You can't. You're afraid!
Yes!
Dead. He'd broken her neck.
Yes!
I will. You're terribly direct in your questions.
You're not. Merely direct. What were you doing there? At Old Fort Point?
John. Old friends. Acquaintances call me Scottie.
You've nothing to apologize for.
Well... anywhere in particular?
How old?
I don't like them.
Yes...
But the small scenes, the fragments in the mirror: you remember them.
Vaguely...
How do you know?
There's a name on the gravestone.
This part is dream, I think. There is a tower and a bell and... a garden below... but it seems to be in Spain... a village in Spain. And then it clicks off, and is gone.
It's not fair, it's too late. It wasn't supposed to happen this way, it shouldn't have happened...!
Why?
Yes... you run this hotel.
Please answer my question.
Does she sleep here? Ever?
Have you had any dizzy spells this week?
Normal.
Gavin? Gavin Elster? You'd think I'd would. No.
Could be.
Johnny!
You haven't told me everything.
No, not Carlotta. Elster's wife.
Well, I detected an undercurrent.
Yes! That's it!
Well, if it's absolutely necessary...
You're an asshole.
Tonight we return once again to the cave. Tonight we let the monsters out. We fill ourselves with the spirits of Genghis Khan, Joe Namath, JFK, Paton, Lombardi, Hemingway...
The floor was wet. She slipped!
I have plenty of friends.
The hell you do.
And you're a little fucking reject.
Go home!
Four hours and fifteen minutes. I can make Vegas in 3 and change.
I'm calling the ambulance.
We have to call the ambulance.
There's more.
Boyd you idiot, the shit's coming down!
You got us into this mess.
You got some mighty fucking fine bad timing Adam. We got a rehearsal situation here.
I won't do it.
You and I have done nothing. You especially. We are innocent.
Money?
Don't sweet lip me.
Okay. Hi.
What's goosed?
Tony? This is Keith Fisher. You're doing my wedding and I'm calling about the chair situation. Yeah, I'll hold.
Not really.  Yes, the Fisher wedding chairs...
We need padded chairs.
All right people. New plan. Not even a new plan so much as a modification of the old plan.
It goes; "Today is the first day of the rest of our lives."
He is not cracking up.
What you just said. Say it again.
You're sick.
Not a prayer.
I'm a lifesaver. A lighthouse. Up all night in the rain, in stormy gale force wind, tornado and fucking earthquakes. I stay lit for you. I stay lit. I don't go dark. I never go dark!
The need to know is clear. What did Adam tell Lois? That's the name of the game. What did Adam tell Lois? What does Lois know?
May we have the rings please?
Caterer?
Hotel for my parents, the tent, the band, the Judge...
Don't you dare.
You know how important this is to my mother. You know that.
He's weird. And I expect more from you.
You expect more what?
You're going to be hungover for three days. Like those guys on "Oprah" that get drunk and have disgusting sex with prostitutes and then say their vows with the stench of cheap hotel whore sex all over them.
Okay.
Keith do not trivialize this.
We're supposed to have gold-trimmed padded seats, now they're telling me that there was a mistake and we can't have padded.
Do you love me?
I'm working on it, I've made three calls.  I can't stop thinking about how much I love you.
What are you doing?
The chairs.
I left a message. I think it's going to be okay.
Cancel?! Cancel?! Are you out of your fucking mind?!
We're not canceling.
Do you love me?
What are you talking about?
You put him down or don't bother coming back.
I could have done it better. I'm a fucking ball-buster I am.
You never walked away dad. You could have walked away.
I love you dad.
Yeah. I got some kind of buzzing. Like a zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz thing just chipping away in the back of my skull.
The first day.
A move?
Well that ought to be about the end of that.
Liz do you take Fisher to be your beloved husband, to respect, honor and cherish him till death do you part?
I don't think that's a good idea.
No, the children sleep with me.
Are there many windows?
What about them?
Which couch?
Oh, some years ago I heard my mother talking about it. But is it true?
It's my fault. If I'd come to see you more often, if I'd invited you here for holidays, maybe everything would be different.
Let me pass!
I'd be really ungrateful, if I didn't like you, sir; you took me and my little girl in when I didn't know where to turn.
Is it all right?
Fifteen yards.
That's fifteen by seven?
No, sir, it's nearly six o'clock.  Okay, let's get a move on!  When are you leaving?
My God, what have you done to him!
I don't want you to untie me. Kill him and then I'll give you the money.
He was very good. Better than some people would think.
I don't know anything about these things, Jorge ...
I don't understand how you can like being alone so much.
What are you doing here? Get out.
Yes. Why?
They're varicose veins. It isn't leprosy.
I had so many things to think about!
When you are, miss.
Would you mind telling me what I did wrong to you to deserve your insults?
I've had a gutful of this.
I'm only good at making people laugh.
) Daryl Lindenmeyer was only here briefly, one semester at most. But he was singularly the most brilliant student I ever had in a classroom. He created programs so beautiful, so lyrical, they were almost like symphonies...
You son-ofâ€”aâ€”bitch, I'm going to kill you.
What the hell did you have to shoot the busboy for?
Before you, nobody else had gotten close enough to Sid 6.7 to take a shot at him. Hell, nobody else had even been able to start tracking him before he got to them first.  New scar â€”â you making it okay in there?
But with the six months off I get for being your guinea pig, I've only got to survive another 17 years, 5 months, and 23 days.
You're wasting your time. I'm not going to play any more of your goddam games.
Don't worry, they have no idea where you are.
I should have told him.
I think we both know who did.  What's so urgent?
Ms. Deane, you wanted to see me?
What's the assignment?
Barnes, where the hell have you been?!
Call off the manhunt looking for me. I didn't kill the transport guards.
Or what, you'll authorize my death a second time today?
Barnes used to work for him when he was still a cop in the field, remember?
Simulations are supposed to give participants practice in realistic, dangerous scenarios while protecting them from the risks they are exposed to in the real world.
I haven't been working on anything.
It feels so.. .real.
... and you get nanoâ€”death.  Don't worry, I've got a bunch of other ones.
You need a maid.
SID â€”â NO!!!
You're not my therapist. You're hear to study me. Face it â€”â I'm nothing more than a lab rat to you.
If I had died yesterday, you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if I carry any genetic predisposition toward violence.

What are you doing?
Remember a few years ago when music schools were using a computerized teaching tool that accidently started frying kids' brains?

For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak with most miraculous organ.
This is getting you pumped up, isn't it? This is like the World Series to you.
Sid 6.7 is no longer bound by his programming.
Don't worry about it, all right?
This isn't a game, Parker!
You okay?
...I think so...You?
I couldn't tell you.
What if he's busy tonight?
For Schumann.
What can it hurt.
He, uh, has he been in the "jail" long?
Yeeaahhh...  Ohmigod ... ohmigod... ohmigod...
What happens if he doesn't have his medication?
I'm concerned about the driver of the rig.
We don't need it to prove out.  We need it to <u>distract</u> them for two weeks til the election.
What's it gonna cost? 
Yes

Buddy, buddy, when ya gonna realize it's big game hunters that bag the elephants, not retail brokers. I heard this story about Gekko... he was on the phone 30 seconds after the Challenger blew up selling NASA stocks short.
Yeah, but he didn't see me.
Got a little action there, eh buddy?
Gimme a break. You buy Bluestar Airlines yesterday. Today they just happen to get good news and the stock goes bat shit. You must have ESP. A real Nostradamus.  Jesus Christ, what are friends for?
All right, I owe you one Marv.
I agree. Go thou and sin no more.

...thanks Natalie.
So, does "this guy" have a tip for an honest lawyer?
What about you, I hear you guys are handling the Fairchild Foods merger and it may not be going through. Any surprises I haven't read about in the Wall Street Journal?
....Relax Roget  You're 82M in the account numbers and I'm the Invisible Man... they're always looking for red flags, Gekko's always getting checked by them, they never come up with anything... we're invulnerable on this...
I just want to let you know Mr. Gekko I read all about you at NYU Business, and I think you're an incredible genius and I've always dreamed of only one thing -- to do business with a man like you...
Mr. Gekko -- thank you for the chance. You won't regret this, you're with a winner.
Follow him? Mr. Gekko I...  It's not what I do. I could lose my license. If the SEC found out, I could go to jail. It's inside information, isn't it?
...we have 37.2 million invested. At this point, we're up 3.1 million and some change. If it goes to 75 bucks we can clean close to 12 mill.
Mr. Gekko, I'm there for you 110%.
You don't understand. I want to be surprised...astonish me, sport, new info, don't care where or how you get it, just get it... My wife tells me you put a move on Darien. Here's some inside info for you. That Euroflash GQ guy she's going with's got big bucks but he's putting her feet to sleep. Exit visas are imminent. So don't lose your place in line.  Oh, jeez, I wish you could see this. The lights coming up over the water. I've never seen a painting that captures the beauty of the ocean at this moment.  ...an old Russian proverb - "a fisherman always sees another fisherman from afar." I like you sport, I ever tell you that... Gordon, call me Gordon from now on.
The art of which is deception. Spread the buy orders through different accounts and you won't get burned...
How much is enough Gordon?
I'd give anything to have this in my house, even for a week.
Not really. I'd say that Gordon is one of the most astute collectors around. He has a great eye and he only buys the best. Like this rug for instance, a silk Tabriz, the finest of its kind. The day after he bought it in London, a dealer representing the Saudi Royal Family offered him twice what he paid. It absolutely makes the room. See how this little bit of celadon in the border is picked up in the cushions oh the sofa... although...  I don't know if I would have used that tea dipped linen for the upholstery - too dingy. And it's a sacrilege having that Pre-Columbian pot in the center of the coffee table. Some dope might use it as an ashtray.
And what do you want?

Well, I'm glad.  Pardon my intrusiveness, but we do have to stick together you know.
Well maybe your wife...
Um...yes.
Oh God.  He's back.  I'm sorry.  Please forget that I...I don't know what I'm saying.  Please...
They're calling me in to work.
Well good.  So you're human.
Kambucha mushroom tea...
What?
It's alright.
Does Norman know?
Jody, she's alive.
No.  Jody, listen to me.  You have to listen to me.  This is not something that I can do right now.  Whatever it was, it's gone.  I need it to be gone now.
But Claire--
Relieved?
You don't know that.  If it's your belief that gives her form, then you've got to shut her out.  Somehow you have to break the connection.
Like what?
But he acted like he'd never heard of it.
I think three...
She's awake.
Fine.
It's just she's been the focus for a while.
Claire, honey, we are not going to march next door and accuse our new neighbor of--
I know.
Mmnph.
Nothing.  There was...I thought I saw something.
Did you call the police?
Yep.
Didn't know he was dead, every stinking paper on the globe.
A flare?
What am I looking at?
...since Caitlin.  You don't remember this?
...Don't get all...
This is the Feur thing?
Who did?
You know what I've got at stake with this paper.  You know that.  I can't help but think that you're doing this now to hurt me, or to sabotage me somehow.
Ever since the accident I've been worried that you'd been unhappy, or...
Maybe you're right.  Maybe I'm losing my mind...
No, it's fine.  I'm fine.
We walked all night...
Sweetheart, it was over a year ago.
Your wife...
THAT'S NOT TRUE!  You wanted to quit!  And then when you did, you hated me for it... so you gave it all to her.
Little village down seven.  Supposed to be charming.
I'm cooking you dinner.
I know.
Thank you for this honor, my dear.
Lasher will act, Rowan.  Whatever it is he wants - he's waited three hundred years to have it.   facing him alone...  I don't like -
With his hands!
But it doesn't make sense.  They - they used Lasher...  they conspired with him.
Aaron - lieten to me...  It's been Lasher - from the start!
Aren't they gauche...?   Those steel things are so - common.
Who is this...?
Who the hel1 -
What's the matter with you...?! What kind of person are you...?!
When is the funeral...?   I am coming to my mother's funeral!!
You can see well in the dark, Rowan.
Lasher - bring us through!
uh - then he - be just -
The wasps were meant for Michael - but there's only so much you can control, isn't there?  The great and powerful lasher - undone by a faulty ladder-..  Why would you hurt him...?!  Answer me.
Made it...?
I'm going to have a baby.   Michael wants to name it after you - if it's a girl.  Diedre Mayfair Curry. Pretty, huh...?  Funny --- I never really thought I'd ever ---
you crave what I might show you.  What you can learn.  What I can give you.  So much more than Michael can.
What Michael gives me is stronger than anything you could ever inderstand.
I LOVE him!
Focus all your powers on me, Rowan until it is done. Only me...
Only you...
Wrong...?  Science is not magic.
I'll destroy you.  I swear it!  If you don't kill me, I'll find a -
Rowan...
My jury's still out on that,
The one time I want it to work...
You know - doors and keyholes are common signposts in out-of-body -
My mother and I used to take long walks and make up stories about the houses and the people who lived inside.  The Queen's house-. the Gangster's house-. the clown's house- Like that.
I was born, in New Orleans, too-
Why don't you let at do that...?
I called Dr. Styles at the Neurological Institute  In L.A., remember...?  He said he'd see you.  He was intrigned.
Michael, do you want to wear those for the rest of your life...?
Rowan...?
Wait a minute.  Rowan - what is going on...?
Do you love me, Michael...?
You sure...?
Your beneficence.
Lasher...  Where --- where is ---
Standard for a Mayfair marriage.  Rowan - there is a codicil concerning the Mayfair assets. They must be... aahhh... held separate from the other party... Michael  that is it's in the will - for centuries.  Tradition enjoins, Rowan.   of course, future earnings from your practice will not fall into -
Yes it is...
I'm sorry?
Yes - I'm sorry ELLEN...
I don't know
No - the police say I've killed fourteen - but I've not - I've killed many more. It amazes me how they just haven't found the bodies. What is society coming to when people just don't get missed. I agree, some of them are well hidden - I probably couldn't even show you where I put them - one girl, number eight I think the press called it - she wasn't even mine - I don't know who did it but I didn't
And how did it feel to be rid of him
Where are you going?
I thought we had a relationship built on trust - and you just slap me in the face...
I had an accident - I fell down stairs...
It's been what, three years?
I'm here about the so called disappearance of your husband - It's best if we let old bones lie. Know what I mean?  I'm working on the WHITE ANGEL case now - and I've got to check all known murderers or suspected murderers for the last five years... And that means you...So where were you last THURSDAY afternoon around five...
As it happens, I was at home alone - maybe we could solve each others problems?
I defy your hamburger theory of life, and all of the unfulfilled hopes and dreams it represents.
Cut it out, before you break something!
This is like my every wet dream come true.  I don't even care that you're here, too, bro.
Oh, how inappropriate is that!
Never say never.
If it isn't straight by now, son, you probably should see a doctor.
Teddy? Would you please please please take me to the prom?
Yeah? You like?
Which you pulled, hard!
We have a truckload of strawberries arriving on Tuesday morning.
We're not ashamed of you, Teddy. We don't approve of the magazine or the models or the so-called "flesh parties" you attend. But we can get past all that.
We think you should give up the magazine. Sell it. Let someone else run it. Whatever it takes.
It was the year of the rhizopus rot. Grandpa almost lost the farm. You sacrificed your dream to go to the prize hog festival. And in the end you saved the peaches and you didn't have to slaughter your sow.
Sometimes you have to do stuff you don't want to do. It's all part of growing up. And it usually works out peachy in the end.
Well, why should I?
Think of it as a rite of passage to manhood.
But those are our dreams, son. We have to make them come true.
I don't have much experience with a...uh...stick.
It's your car. These are all your cars.
Well?
Your parents never wanted to interfere with your life, Ted. They knew your Mom and Dad loved you very much. They knew they did the right thing. But that doesn't mean they didn't watch you and miss you, from afar.
I wondered about them, for so many years. I wondered if I looked like them, acted like them. I wondered why they gave me up.
You can call me Jimmy again. Sheryl Petersen said James sounds too pretentious.
You want it in writing?
Aside from the fact that Mom's eyes are nearly swollen shut from crying and Dad spends all his time under the car trying to fix stuff that isn't broken, things couldn't be better.
Don't even tell me you're hot for Miss Titty Pom Poms over there.
Me-ow.
I have absolutely no intention--
"Local boy inherits more money than god." Call me crazy, but I smell human interest.
I see. So more like a tight rope walker who secretly wants to be a trapeze artist.
Considering this is your first time on a private jet, on which you are interviewing the world's most eligible bachelor,  you are extremely cavalier.
Second only to unbridled, narcissistic conceit.
Then you'll see who's really holding on to you.
Well? Where the hell are you?
Wearing them?  Or humping them?
That's refreshingly deviant.
Tell me more.
I have to be honest with you, Ted. I really despise "The Girls of Xenia."
Which explains the continued success of "Heaven" for how many decades?
You're quick. I like that.
And I thought maybe I'd take up boating. I've always wanted to be a "coxswain."
The thing is, I'll need a first mate.
I know where you can find an excellent editor-in-chief.
What is all this? When are you coming home?
Just a few tokens of my affection. I'll be back soon, don't worry.
You're free.  You can do anything you ever wanted to do!
I never figured you for a pimp.
What law, Merk? Having fun? Letting down our hair on prom night?
Just a couple of finishing touches. My parents always said you never get a second chance to make a good first impression.
You seem like you're anything but lazy, Uncle Billy.
Thanks for teaching me an important lesson. What makes a family is love, not blood.
All is fair in "Heaven," Ted-baby.
I was in the middle of a melodramatic exit. It wouldn't really make a statement if I tiptoed out the door...What are you selling?
You've got the wrong guy. The closest my parents have been to the Amazon is the Brazilian pavilion at Epcot.
I was thinking, Antigua, maybe.
I love Antigua.  Maybe I'll come visit you.
Gator can't see what's in front of it for shit.  They see out the sides.  That one don't even know Walter's arm's in his mouth.
No.  Not after that night.  I don't know what happened.  Maybe he caught her with some john... All I know is, the next morning the girl was gone and there was a dead boy... Indian kid named Davy.  Used to live down the road there in a wrecked car. Him and Suzie were at the Glades that night.  It was right after that, Ray got Suzie busted and sent her away.  That's what there is to say about Ray Duquette.
I just want to get it over with.  My mom's making me do this. I just want to forget it.
The next thing... his hand was in my shorts... you know, from behind.  His fingers... his fingers...
That's okay, Kelly.  You're doing fine.  But I have to ask you something here. When you say it hurt.  Was this the first time a man was inside you?
If old pictures interest you, come back some time, there's quite a collection down in the pagoda.  I'll see you get a proper tour.
How long?
I'm gonna take you back to the office. Will you put out a call on Suzie's car for me?
Yeah, maybe, a little.
About a year ago.
Yeah.
And when he arrived at your house, was anyone there?
Where's this coming from?
The teeth, were they...
Way I hear it, he was pretty tight with the kids, one of the guys...
Okay, what's the matter?
Don't bother.  I'm taking a trip.
Don't forget the car wash.
We have to stick with the plan.
You know what it takes.
I'm sorry, Kelly.  I'm sorry it had to happen like this.  She was losing it...
Hello?
I can't help it.  He gives me the creeps... I mean why was Suzie so scared of him?  She's not that way.  I think he did something...
I don't know... I think it was something else... Suzie says the bust was bullshit...
I love you.  Now give me the line.
Just like that?
That's cop bullshit.
But she ran away.
Yeah, well, you fixed that.  What the hell happened, anyway?
I thought this was supposed to be a vacation.  Why didn't you buy a nice big power boat?
I was worried about you, Suzie.  I decided we should all get together, one more time, before we split up.
We?
Wait a minute.  Now I know where I've heard of you.  You're the gadget guy.
All right, if it'll make you happy, I'll try that.
Is this leading somewhere?
Prepare what?
You feeling all right?
All that jumping and kicking.
So... spontaneous.  All that leaping off buildings and Chinese fighting and whatnot.
Those kids, they took my wagon. Never got it back.
Oh, damn!  That's it.
I'd love to stop him, but have you noticed the hundred armed men?
God in heaven, what is that?!
You didn't tell us you had this on!
Anyone?
Well, where I come from it kind of goes with the territory.  Texas.
You must excuse the Doctor.  No one has ever beaten him at his little game.
She's perfectly safe.
You bring the best out in a man.
You know, I really hate being toyed with before someone shoots me.
Look, I'm Captain James West...
Doyle's the name, sir.  Of the Connemara Doyles.  And there's not a man riding the rails who holds a candle to meself.  That having been said, sir, you're five minutes late so let's be on our way!  Your friend's already aboard.
You're not that big.
Has it penetrated that adrenaline- addled skull that you are surrounded by seventy-eight of my loyal followers?  You are in my domain!
That would be... the Mexican War?
Because I am holding all the western territories hostage, Mr. West!  A town a day will disappear!  Willard was merely a test run, a stroll in the park.  Next, I level all of Albuquerque!  Yes, that's right.  Only yesterday I learned what you undoubtedly already know: your own President will be there.  What an added bonus! The gods are shining on me!  After tomorrow every American citizen will rise up and demand I be given back my humble little empire!
Who was this partner of his?
Hey...!
I always knew you'd end up in a crow's cage.
Hey, remember?  You don't need my help, Madmartigan.  Little rabbit trap like this?  Come on!  I could open it for you, but I wouldn't wanna insult you!
Willow Ufgood.
You are the guardian, Willow.  You must take her to Tir Asleen.
Why can't you do it?  You have mag- ical powers.
Now, you know where you're going?  Down there, through those trees, follow the river.  You'll know the crossroads by a big daikini struc- ture.  Willow, this is serious business.  Don't waste any time, the outer world is no place for a Nelwyn.  Give the baby to the first daikini you see, then hurry home as fast as you can.
Please?  I'm dyin' of thirst in here.
Don't make me angry, Peck.
Are you a warrior?
You hear trouble.
Whatcha thinkin' about, Willow?
You!!
These Pecks make terrible nurse- maids.
Because she's sick.
I'll help you...!
She's in love.
It's not a Nelwyn baby.
Can't we keep it, Dada?
Your will!  Your will!  What else could it be?
Raziel!  I transformed them all! I'm a magician!
Get down!  The ritual chant! Quick!  Protect yourself!
Elves!  They're always tormenting babies.  They make them cry and take their tears.
Take your time.  Don't worry about the elves.  They won't come out here.
Obviously.
Sure, I'm sorry. Hope you don't mind me plugging in to your battery. Mine's dead... How can I help? What can I do?
Maybe milking.
Put my car in the garage and close the door.
Hey, Sam...
Are you really ever coming back?
So one of them got to him.
Maybe.
Maybe.
You're still convinced there's a link to the department?
What's-her-name moved to Buffalo.
We're looking for a suspect. We've reason to believe he's still in the area.
Nobody meant any harm. The boy was curious. I unloaded the gun -
Buttons are Hochmut.
I did some carpentry summers when I was going to school.
There was.
Oh, come on, Rachel. No way.
I got there late, John.
Wrong.
You admit you're lying?
Elaine, I don't want to have to take you in for questioning. You've got his car, you were the last to see him â€
Yes, thank you very much.
John said you're Amish.
Yes.
Who was that man?
How can this be? How can you do such a thing? Is this plain? Is this the ordnung?
I have done nothing against the ordnung.
He's from... Ohio... My cousin.
We'll, them Ohio Amish sure must be different.  Our Lancaster brethren, they just don't have that kind of fight in them.
John, lost control of himself. He... will be repentant.
He's not in this building.
Get back in there.
They are English. They don't understand.
Aunt Em!
Dorothy, please!  We're trying to count! Fifty-eight--
-- no place like home -- there's no place like home -- no place --
Then this is a day of Independence For all the Munchkins and their descendants!
From now on you'll be history
Oh, come on - come on! We'll soon find the Wizard!
Uhhhh -- yes...
What are you going to do with my dog?  Give him back to me!
No!  No -- no!  Here -- you can have your old slippers -- but give me back Toto.
Toto, too.
Are you ready now?
Yes, I'm ready now.
No, no --  now don't tell me.  They -- they don't understand you at home.  They don't appreciate you. You want to see other lands -- big cities -- big mountains -- big oceans --
Oh, yes - you - you wanted to go home, huh?
...paper?
Ahh --- Oh, it ticks!  Listen!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Well, you didn't have to go and hit me, did you?  Is my nose bleeding?
Oh.
Yes -- let's run!
Because I'm still scared!
No, but it's wonderful for threatening with.
That noise don't come from no ordinary bird.
Well -- I would never've found it if it hadn't been for you.
Did I scare you?
Um-hmm.
Um-hmm.
But maybe you'd better not.  I've got a witch mad at me, and you might get into trouble.
I don't blame you for that.
Oh, I'll try!  Really, I will.
Oh, dear -- I keep forgetting I'm not in Kansas.
Oil can what?
Here -- here --
The ruby slippers!  What have you done with them? Give them back to me, or I'll ---
Yeah.
What if it were a brontosaurus?
Who at?
What happened?
That's right.
Up!
From now on, we're on enemy ground. You should have something to protect yourself with.
Now, let' s see -- this goes -- Oh, I wish I were better at puzzles.
Dorothy?  Well, what has Dorothy done?
No, her dog!
Come on -- come on --
Look -- you can see it here.  It's wonderful!
Oh -- now look at him!  This is terrible!
...to Dorothy!
Oh --
No, you don't.
Hey -- what about Dorothy?
Uh - now, please don't be angry with me. I'll - I'll do anything you say, only... only if you don't shout at me. It makes me nervous!
Therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Universitatus Committeeatum e plurbis unum, I hereby confer upon you the honorary degree of Th.D.
Elektra King?  Are you insane?  This is her pipeline.
Makes her look even more innocent.
What would she want with weapons grade plutonium?
What kind of bikes did you ride?
But what if...
Sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist?
I did not get the report from an MI-6 agent.
Today, of all days, the sun decides to shine.
A word? Iâ€™m sure by now heâ€™s engineered a hostile takeover.
I met you at my fatherâ€™s funeral.
Funerals arenâ€™t exactly memorable.
Vodka martini.
Surely you believe in living dangerously.
Or did you steal it from your old friend Renard?
Bond. If someone wants you dead, it is Renard. Our government has nothing to gain by killing you.
What are doing, Bond?  Trying to impress this innocent thing?
Now...where were we?
Where?
No! Bond!
Perhaps this isnâ€™t the time...
Warm.
Had a lot of blood in him.
Rorschach's on the case.  He's got Dreiberg in a lather.  He seems to think that someone is "stalking" the Watchmen.
Mm hmm.
Jon -- for GodÂ¹s sake, what do you see?
You did the right thing, Daniel.  Let's stay in touch, okay?  Good night.
No wonder Adrian's rich.  You use that stuff?
I don't mind getting older.  I'm obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide it?
Enough is enough, Daniel.  Where exactly are we?
Would you want to sit out a war?  I mean -- what would be left.
You're full of yourself.  What are you doing?
I beg your pardon . . . ?  Some gratitude.
Hiya, pardner.  Long time no see.
So do I.  So do you.
Maybe.  Or maybe somebody's finally caught up with us.  Somebody with a grudge.  Thought you might want to spread the word.
No.  No.  Cut.  -- Justine, we agreed.  No questions about the Watchmen.
Sit down, Miss Juspeczyk.  As I mentioned, the people in this file are all close associates of Dr. Manhattan.  They have something else in common as well.  They've all developed a fairly . . . exotic form of lymphatic cancer.
Bigger than I thought.  CTU involved . . .
Congratulations, you've just graduated at the head of your class.
You've really got me confused, Cage. On the one hand you showed leadership, courage under fire, a willingness to protect men you hardly knew... and on the other you have an arrest record that pegs you as near sociopathic. Help me out here. I'm not following your evolution.
You want the cheap backstory? The runaway mom, the suicide dad and the foster homes? Gimme a break. You're not interested in my past, you're interested in my future as some kind of spy.
Hey, one miracle at a time. They're on to me now, remember?
Silent Night is the name of a top secret binary nerve agent. The glass canister is shot into the air and detonated. The black and white chemicals mix, forming a toxic cloud. When it settles down to Earth, it'll kill everything in the vicinity.
Yeah, that's right. So now that you know, you understand why it's important that we get it back.
But I hate cops, remember? Except for her.
Silent Night in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys
We're gonna have to step in, Sam. Those CIA boys couldn't find a clown in a field of cactus. Let me take care of it.
So you'll dredge the bottom again. You've done that before. The results were... uneven.
The usual prospects. Convicts, contract killers, murde...
The scum of the Earth.
Ridiculous. Cut him off. I'm sorry Gibbons, you pulled up a shark this time.
I think we should send him whatever he wants.
Whatchu doing here?
You saving me? You talking pretty tough for a guy got himself chained to the ceiling.
What game is that?
What do you get if you finish?
Is she for real? Honey, maybe you should quiet down and let the grownups have a conversation.
Hey, you're good.
Go to hell!
I'm from L.A.
So why don't you tell me something about who you gather information for. They obviously have very deep pockets. Are you from a rival clan?
All I have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts.
Aren't you afraid?
When this is over, we're just gonna take off, the two of us. Take a vacation.
Where's he headed?
You can't talk to it?
What are you doing?
What was that for?
This is your standard dart gun.
I'll leave you two alone to talk.
Oh come on, don't feel bad. You got played, so what? You're new at this. Did you think you could just stroll into this business one day and have all the angles figured out?
This pizda? Never seen him before.
You tell me! You got a sniper up there or what?
What's "Anarchy 99"?
That was for Anders.
We all do.
Storm.  Try to look for the highest vantage point. From what I can figure, he'll need to gain as much altitude as possible to blanket the island.  It is my feeling that Magneto has to--
I don't like him being here.
What are you talking about?
Are you all right?
I'm going to assume that means that the Secret Service is out of commission.  Jean, can you raise me up there?
Some cigars.  Case of beer.
You should always work with a spotter.
I was thinking maybe you and me could go into town.
Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator.
You designed this yourself?
I've found her, Westchester Mall.
It does indeed, Max.
Oh, shit.
The grandson of Victor 'Fronkonsteen'?
Yes, sir.  But I must have taken the wrong one when we came up.
Herr Falkstein! You have your instructions!
Of course.
I promise.
Very....very!
Love me?
What a strange fellow.
Oh, Delbruck, Delbruck.  Was will dien tachlas von Dir?
I suppose you're right.
I hope you find this comfortable. This was Baron Victor's room.
I see.  And where is my grandfather's private library?
well, there was a public and a private library -- he said so in his will.  these books are all very general -- any doctor might have them in his study.
My name is pronounced Fron kon steen.
Isn't it true that Darwin preserved a piece of vermicelli in a glass case until, by some extraordinary means, it actually began to move with voluntary motion?
But aren't you the least bit curious about it, Doctor?  Doesn't the secret of life hold any intrigue for you?
Hearts and kidneys are Tinker Toys! I'm talking about the Central Nervous System.
No, it's pronounced Fron kon steen.
Incidentally -- I don't mean to embarrass you in any way, but I'm a rather brilliant surgeon.  Perhaps I can help you with that hump.
I beg your pardon?
Tonight?
Throw the second switch!
It's not enough.  More!  More, do you hear me?
Oh, do you like it?  I'm not partial to desserts, but this is excellent.
It's trying to talk.  it wants us to take off the straps.
Yes.
What monster?
What???
No!  The only hope now is to get him back here.  If I can just find a way to relieve the pressure on his cerebellum...
There's only one way.
Yes, master.  Are you sure you want to go through with it?
MMMMMmmmmmmm.
MMMmmmm!  MMMmmmm!
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmm!
Are you busy?
Would you like a sandwich?
Whatever it is, it's coming from down there.  I'm going down to see.
Soon, all the electrical secrets of Heaven shall be mine.
Oh, Frederick... you're not only a great doctor, you're a great... you're almost a...
A god?
I think you've done it, master.
I know, but I mean -- not fooling around physically?... Or not fooling around intellectually?
I see what you mean.
There can never... ever... be anything physical between us. You know that, dear.
Nor to Elizabeth.
And Elizabeth has hers.
Yes, I have mine.
MMMMmmmmm!

GRRRHMMNNNJKJMMMNN!
Will you hear "Last Post", Sir?
I listened extra careful to your "Stand To" this mornin', Boy. ft was peifecL I couldn't 've done it better meseif, not even when I was Bugler to The Duke Of Wellington.. .now tell me, where did you get that black eye?
You afeared of the Zulus then, Quartermaster?
I'm to take the Sikali with the main column to the river
